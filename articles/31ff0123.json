    "Fed cuts interest rate by 0.5%, indicating optimism in already strong economy",
    "We are less than six weeks from the most significant election in the history of the United States of America, when the electorate of the most powerful nation in the world elects its leaders for the next four years.",
    "Until a few months ago, the protagonists for the U.S. Presidency were incumbent President Biden and former President Trump. As many as 75% of the US electorate, Republican and Democratic, were \u201cDouble Haters\u201d, who believed neither of these old fogies was capable of leading the nation.",
    "The total meltdown of President Biden at the first Presidential Debate on June 27 provided the inevitable pivotal point in an untenable situation.",
    "After the debate, President Biden made valiant efforts to convince his supporters that he just had \u201ca bad day\u201d, he was confident that he would still be capable of beating Trump for the presidency and running the country for a second term. He pointed to the undeniably strong performance of the Biden/Harris administration so far during its first term.",
    "Biden claimed that his administration had transformed an economy near recession in 2021, inherited from the only twice-impeached president in history, into what is accepted today as the strongest economy in the world. Inflation, the main complaint against the Biden administration, which was running at an all-time high of 9.1% in 2022, has been cooling, and is now at 2.5%, The Federal Reserve Board cut the benchmark federal funds interest rate last Wednesday by half percent \u201cin light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks\u201d, according to the non-political rate-setting committee. While the cut has already invigorated the stock market, its impact on the economy, though displaying optimism, will take some time.",
    "The gains made in the economy, and even more importantly, the revival of the dignity, both domestic and international, of the White House made by the Biden administration, are both unprecedented and undeniable. Unfortunately, so was the decline in Biden\u2019s mental acuity and physical capacity in the recent past. He was kidding no one but himself when he claimed he would retain the ability to do the toughest job in the world for four more years. First Lady, Dr Jill Biden, a young 75-year-old, may also have been reluctant to relinquish the trappings of the presidency. Behind many an old man stands a younger woman who demands a better life \u2013 be it a nicer dress, a newer-model Mercedes or four more years at the White House \u2013 or die in the attempt.",
    "The kingmakers of the Democratic Party had seen the writing on the wall long before Biden was persuaded to withdraw from the race, which he did in a speech to the nation from the Oval Office on July 25. During the speech, Biden endorsed his Vice-President Kamala Harris for the Presidency, an endorsement which was unanimously and enthusiastically confirmed by the Democratic Party.",
    "Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic nomination for the Presidency on the last day of the Democratic National Convention, on August 23.",
    "Trump and his radical-red MAGA (Make America Great Again) cult, renowned authority on the US constitution, claimed that Biden\u2019s withdrawal was clearly unconstitutional. They howled that Biden had been unanimously and constitutionally elected as the Democratic presidential nominee by the Electors at the National Democratic Party primaries. They demanded the reinstatement of Biden as the Democratic Party nominee. Their only selfless motive was to jealously protect the constitutional rights of their sworn enemies, the members of the Democratic Party. And if this were not done immediately, they were threatening to sue the Democratic Party for the reimbursement of all expenditure they had wasted on advertisements on the basis that Biden was to be the Democratic nominee!",
    "The Democrats had been slumbering in the polls for weeks with Biden as the candidate, way behind a confidently unhinged Trump. Today, Kamala is challenging Trump, even leading in some national and swing state polls, many above the margins of error. This impetus shows no signs of abating. Campaign financing, which had been dwindling, has shown an upsurge at record levels, collecting more than triple the funds that Trump\u2019s did in August, according to the latest figures released by the Federal Election Commission.",
    "Vice-President Harris has been picking up endorsements from leaders of all areas of public life in the nation. Political statesmen of all stripes, military leaders, celebrities and Hollywood, billionaires, tycoons and captains of industry, writers and philosophers, sporting legends and the country\u2019s leading economists.",
    "Sixteen of the world\u2019s most notable economists \u2013 all Nobel Prize winners \u2013 warned that \u201cDonald Trump could invite recession if he wins the presidency in November\u201d, with his economic policies based on increased tariffs. Larry Summers, Professor and President Emeritus of Harvard University, called Trump\u2019s economic policy on tariffs \u201cthe most irrational economic policy that any president has introduced in the last half century\u201d.",
    "Defending his economic plans during a campaign speech last week in North Carolina, Trump countered that \u201ccountries and people want to kill him because of his trade policies\u201d, which were aimed at helping America first. I think Trump is being overly modest. I am sure there are many other reasons why countries and people want to kill him.",
    "The endorsement of music sensation Taylor Swift has resulted in a sharp spike in voter registrations, estimated to be currently topping 650,000, mainly from younger voters who have never voted before and will probably cast their ballots for Kamala.",
    "All this pent-up frustration made a desperate and terrified Trump target his rage on these \u201cSwifties\u201d, whom he perceives are causing damage to his dwindling fortunes, with this post on his social media platform, Truth Social:",
    "The reaction of a former President of the United States or the plaintive response, arms akimbo, of Taylor Swift\u2019s spoilt eight-year-old younger brother when his older sister got more ice cream?",
    "With the momentum accelerating for Kamala, with all the major polls going against him, with even moderate Republicans deserting him, he has recently made a series of errors of judgment, many against the advice of his closest allies.",
    "The foremost advice given by his closest supporters throughout the campaign is the one strategy Trump, \u201cyour favorite president\u201d, is personally incapable of following: to stick to the issues instead of narcissistically rambling on ad hominem insults, inventions of past performances and lies on everything else.",
    "The public has lost interest in lies about windmills causing cancer; battery operated boats leading to being eaten by sharks. Surpassing all previous ridiculous fantasies was a recently contrived end-of-life confession by former San Francisco Mayor, Willie Brown, who was supposed to have told Trump, as they were both hurtling to their deaths in a helicopter crash, \u201cYou remember that lady I was going out with, the Prosecutor? Well, I must tell you, before I meet my maker, that she was a terrible person!\u201d",
    "Ninety-year-old Mayor Brown, who had indeed dated Kamala 30 years ago, has stated, with amused contempt, that he had never been in a helicopter with Trump. Even if he did, and was facing imminent death, only Trump could imagine that Mayor Brown would spend his last moments talking about someone he had dated, just in case Kamala would be contesting Trump for the presidency in the future, and the information would be useful for Trump!",
    "These idiotic hallucinations and fantasies of a perverted imagination only goes to prove the extent to which Trump\u2019s mind is continuing to unravel.",
    "Trump\u2019s next misstep was the selection of Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, which was discussed and ridiculed at length in my essay last week. Both Vance and Trump are sticking to their vicious lies about Haitian illegal immigrants eating the pets of the residents of Springfield, Ohio. Lies which have been completely debunked by the Republican Governor, Mike DeWine and Republican Attorney-General, Dave Yost of Ohio and Springfield\u2019s Mayor, Rob Rue.",
    "Bomb threats have forced Springfield civic authorities to close government buildings and schools. Threats against the lives of legal Haitian immigrants have them cowering in fear. Nevertheless, Trump and Vance continue to escalate these dastardly lies in spite of these dangers to lives and property, purely for political purposes.",
    "Trump has recently been seen in the company of a notorious radical right conspiracy theorist, Laura Loomer. A 31-year-old far-right floozy, who, according to Trump\u2019s other senior advisers, Trump has allowed himself to be \u201cLoomered\u201d. She has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s most trusted advisers, seen with him on all his recent campaign travels. She was Trump\u2019s companion at the somber occasion of the 9/11 Memorial, pretty ironical because she is a \u201c9/11 Truther\u201d, a person who believes that the bombings of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 were \u201can inside job\u201d. Her response to the news that 2,000 migrants had died crossing the Mediterranean? \u201cGood. Here\u2019s to 2,000 more\u201d. She has also authored some choice racist postings and vitriolic rantings of hate speech, her most recent being that if Kamala wins the presidency, \u201cthe White House will smell like curry\u201d.",
    "Trump\u2019s even more controversial prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is perhaps Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina and gubernatorial candidate of that state in the November election, Mark Robinson.",
    "Trump has been so enthused with Robinson and the potential value of his contribution to his re-election campaign, that Robinson has been a regular speaker at campaign rallies, where Trump has introduced him as \u201can outstanding person. I\u2019ve gotten to know him so well. He is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr on steroids\u201d and \u201cone of the great leaders in the country\u201d.",
    "You remember, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the great civil rights leader who was assassinated in the 1960s. The one who had the famous dream, \u201cthat my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d.",
    "Yes, that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. That\u2019s the one Trump thought Robinson resembles, even eclipses.",
    "Robinson has posted his own dreams, rather more disturbing and of disgusting racial and overtones than the patriotic dreams of Dr King. \u201cDreams\u201d on race, gender, sex and slavery on a pornographic website titled \u201cNude Africa\u201d, where he called the universally revered Martin Luther King Jr a \u201cf\u2026ing commie bastard\u201d, and \u201cpreferred Hitler to Barack Obama\u201d.",
    "Describing himself as a \u201cBlack Nazi\u201d, he said he couldn\u2019t join the Ku Klux Klan because they didn\u2019t admit black people. He opined that slavery was not all that bad, saying, \u201csome people needed to be slaves. I wish they would bring slavery back. I would certainly buy a few\u201d. He called homosexuals and transgender folk \u201cfilth\u201d. Robinson is a holocaust denier, and a gun enthusiast who mocks the survivors of mass shootings. About abortion, he said \u201cwomen should keep their skirts down and men their trousers up, and stop killing babies\u201d.",
    "In his defense, Robinson identifies himself as an Evangelical Christian, and has been a regular preacher at the Trinity Baptist Church in Mooresville, North Carolina.",
    "Though half his campaign staff has left him, the Black Nazi is still the Republican candidate for the Governorship of North Carolina. Robinson\u2019s endorsement by Trump remains unshaken, the Fuhrer\u2019s confidence in him indestructible. Birds of a feather\u2026..?",
    "Trump excelled himself in a Pennsylvania rally last Tuesday, when he outlined his abortion policy. He turned on the charm, saying that he knew women are \u201cless healthy, less safe, more stressed, depressed and unhappy\u201d today than they were four years ago. But all this will all change when he is re-elected.",
    "\u201cBecause I am your protector. I want to be your protector. As president, I have to be your protector. You will be happy, healthy, confident and free when I am your president. You will no longer be in danger. You will no longer feel abandoned. I will be there to protect you. You will no longer be thinking about abortion\u201d.",
    "Speech made without a trace of irony or shame, with the silver tongue of a convicted rapist and sexual predator of international notoriety and contempt.",
    "Unfortunately for Trump, these preposterous claims have brought yet another accusation of sexual assault by a People\u2019s Magazine Reporter, Natasha Stroynoff, who reported last week that Trump had sexually assaulted her during an interview at Mar a Lago in 2006!",
    "Trump also promoted his latest merchandise, a silver Cryptocoin of enormous historical value, available at the bargain-basement price of $100, with an actual cash value of $30.",
    "All these actions and speeches of the greatest snake-oil salesman in history echo a variation of JFK\u201ds famous words, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Trump\u201d.",
    "D-Day invasion of Normandy \u2013 a day for peace, a never-ending dawn",
