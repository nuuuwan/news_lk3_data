    "Lessons from my career: synthesising management theory with practice \u2013 Part 17",
    "My journey at the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF) marked a significant chapter in my career. It began with a unique opportunity, as I was interviewed by the President and offered the position of Chairman, ETF Board following my successful tenure at the Ceylon Ceramic Corporation.",
    "Arriving at the ETF was very low-key, unlike the current practice of a ceremony with friends and family, garlands and speeches. I was told to come to the board room where Mr Justin Dias, Secretary of the Labour Ministry, was meeting the senior staff. I went there and, after introductions, assumed office. From the moment I entered the premises, I observed the activities and behaviour of the staff. I had to navigate through the clerical staff tables to reach my office.",
    "It was large, accommodating the board table, but it was very primitive and untidy. The curtains were hanging from a cord and sagging at the top. My chair was a wooden rattan bottomed seat. I found it challenging to adjust to it, having been used to rotating chairs with wheels, in my earlier positions.",
    "At the meeting chaired by Mr Dias, I noticed the more vociferous influencers. I was immediately able to identify the argumentative confrontative types. My MBA studies had taught me how to analyse individuals. I had learnt the lesson of observation from reading Dr Ohno\u2019s Circle, where every trainee supervisor at Toyota is trained to observe the surroundings and document them. I was, in fact, practising it but documenting it only in my head.",
    "Before pushing for further progress, I believed it was essential to provide better facilities for the staff. We improved the lunch rooms, creating a cleaner and more inviting environment. The previously smelly toilets were enhanced with a janitorial service, eliminating the hygiene issues they previously presented. We also made a special room for the drivers. These improvements were not just about physical changes; they were about showing the staff that their well-being was a priority. The impact of these changes on the staff was palpable, and it was heartening to see them respond positively to the improved facilities.",
    "My office with its primitive curtains was updated, and had a somewhat new look. I was aware that too many changes would likely arouse the curiosity of the Ministry and Labour Department staff. Later, I gave a facelift to my office as well. It was necessary because many of the Regional Heads of foreign banks would call on me whenever they were in Sri Lanka, mainly to solicit deposits. After all, Treasury Bills were not yet the preferred investment at that time, and banks needed deposits.",
    "I did not want them to think that the ETF was a primitive place. The changes attracted the curiosity of the Ministry officials. Once, a high Ministry official suddenly called on me to purportedly discuss some issues, but rather than focusing on the discussion, his eyes were roaming all over my office, even turning his body completely around. His eyes fell on my new revolving chair, which was delivered only after 6pm, when there would hardly be spying eyes. Neither the Ministry nor the Labour Department had revolving chairs, but they purchased them soon after my example.",
    "Many corporate seniors who came to meet me to sort out some ETF-related issues would often comment that I was too young to be a chairman. In 1989, it was not common to see young chairmen of public entities. Except for Prof Lakshman Watawala, I cannot recall another young chairman at that time. I was 39 years old when I was appointed. Although President Premadasa believed I could handle the position, many were doubtful. They had not factored in that I was the General Manager of Ceylon Ceramics with 4,500 employees, about 15 factories, several strong unions, and running at a loss. I had managed it successfully in my own way.",
    "I mentioned this problem to my father and asked for his advice on how to handle it. As an expert on British history, he promptly said, \u201cTell them that William Pitt the younger was 24 years old when he became Prime Minister of Britain.\u201d Apparently, Pitt had performed well, making many revolutionary changes. I would give this answer whenever people commented on my age.",
    "At the first board meeting, an essential item on the agenda was the revision of nominee directorships. ETF had significant investments in many enterprises. With the appointment of the new board, these directorships had to be reassigned. What was at stake included the Intercontinental Hotel, Dankotuwa Porcelain, Sampath Bank, a joint venture producing shoes, and Dockyard and Drydocks, among the significant ones.",
    "I thought it would be proper to let the other directors choose first, and I would take any leftovers. Mr Justin Dias, the Secretary, had already taken Sampath Bank. When everyone had their choice, only Dankotuwa Porcelain was left. Still, nobody wanted it because it was considered a lost cause and had even been closed for some time. I took it quite willingly because of my familiarity with ceramics at my previous place as General Manager of Ceylon Ceramics Corporation.",
    "In hindsight, Dankotuwa turned out to be the best choice. After the factory reopened, a new Chairman, Dr Randeni, was appointed, and he turned it around. Dr Randeni was a Central Bank Officer and nominated by the Finance Ministry. He had used his official trips to promote the products in the export markets and had transformed the management too. A few months later, he asked me for lunch and asked whether I would accept the Chairmanship of Dankotuwa.",
    "He mentioned that during our few board meetings together, he noticed a similarity in our thinking. It would be beneficial to fill the position before he leaves to take up an assignment at the Central Bank of Western Samoa. I accepted, but the Finance Ministry made a fuss and brought out a cabinet decision that the Chairman of Dankotuwa Porcelain had to be jointly decided by the Ministers of Finance and of Labour. Once again, providence was on my side. After Dr Ranjith Atapattu quit his ministerial position to take up an international assignment, the Prime Minister, who was also the Finance Minister, became the acting Labour Minister as well, with whom I had developed a good rapport. Holding both the required posts, he approved the appointment without hesitation. What I did at Dankotuwa is another story.",
    "After one month in office at ETF, I was called by the President\u2019s office for a progress review meeting. When he questioned me about what I had accomplished, I was at a loss. I was still figuring out the operations and problems. It was just one month. I explained what I was doing, but he wasn\u2019t impressed. He leaned back in his chair and said, \u201cIf it were to do ordinary things, I could have appointed any ordinary person, but I selected you to do extraordinary things. So go ahead and do something different\u201d.",
    "A few months later, when the President called for a progress review, I presented all the new initiatives I had begun to implement. He was pleased. After the meeting, when we all got up to leave, he called me and said, \u201cWe are glad we appointed you. You are doing well\u201d. I was over the moon.",
    "The staff were hardly united. They all expected directives and decisions to be made by the chairman. That was the culture. Once, there was an issue involving two departments, and I called both heads to meet me to find a resolution. I found that the problem could have been easily solved if the heads had discussed the issue positively amongst themselves. I was puzzled and asked them to discuss and resolve it. One department head tells me, pointing to the other seated next to him, \u201cPlease tell him to do such and such a thing before we discuss\u201d, and I shot back and said, \u201cI am dealing with adults, so get together and sort things out yourselves\u201d.",
    "There was one officer who told me confidentially that my attempts to create unity would boomerang on me. He said these nasty people will unite against you, and that is why previous administrations used the tried and tested British method of divide and rule. I was shocked.",
    "There were similar issues where I was pressing the staff to deliver faster and take more responsibility. This did not go down well. They all wanted me to make decisions. Even buying sugar for the office tea service required my approval. I realised why later.",
    "I was invited as the chief guest for the Staff Officers\u2019 Union AGM. The President of the union delivered a speech in which he stated that the new chairman wants us to assume more responsibility. However, he cautioned that stepping into uncharted territory could be dangerous. Therefore, it is advisable to follow the chairman\u2019s instructions rather than making the decisions. He illustrated the point with a story.",
    "It went like this. In a remote country, a man was riding a donkey, and his wife was on foot, trailing behind. An onlooker commented that this is not nice, it would be better for the wife to ride the donkey and the man to lead on foot. The answer was that it was the culture of the country, man first. A few years later, he is seen still riding the donkey, but this time, his wife is leading the way. The same onlooker asks, \u201cOh, have you changed your country\u2019s culture?\u201d The rider replies, \u201cNo, but now there are mines on this path, so the wife is sent ahead\u201d.",
    "With this attitude, you can imagine the effort I had to put into changing the culture at the ETF. I delegated many activities after obtaining board approval. Some were done with standard ratios. For instance, weekend overtime required my approval, but I had no idea whether it was needed. I established standards, stating that as long as a standard number of claims were processed per man hour, the department head could approve the overtime. Similarly, even for sugar, they had to show the standard cups per staff member. Many accused me of trying to run the office like running a factory. I accepted that, but it was certainly more efficient.",
    "The southern rebellion was still in full swing. Some days, the rebels would send a chit, and the office would close out of fear. On one such day, I had to get the keys and open the office. There was no one else in the office. I spent the morning chatting with the Labour Commissioner and the senior Ministry staff because they too had no work without the rest of the staff. I went home for lunch, hoping to come back.",
    "After lunch, I was about to leave when a bee from nowhere came and stung my finger. I was in the process of trying to remove the sting when the telephone rang. It was landlines then; mobiles were not heard of. My wife answered, and the voice on the other end said in Sinhala, \u201cMr Wijesinha has done an unwanted thing today by opening the office when we directed that the office should be closed. If he goes back, he will suffer the fate of Thevis Guruge\u201d Mr Guruge was shot dead only a few days before. My life was on edge.",
    "I had to always be ready to duck whenever a motorcycle came near me on the road. The next time the chits came, I did not go to the office. I was asked by the Ministry to come to the office, but I refused. All chairmen who had not turned up were asked for an explanation by the Presidential Secretariat. Many Chairmen were calling me to discuss how we should reply. My response was clear: I would admit that I did not come to the office due to the fear for my life, and if this is not acceptable, I would resign. After all, I was qualified in both engineering and accountancy, and with an MBA, I could easily find another job. I was not a political stooge working at the whim and fancy of those in power. I was not asked to resign, and I carried on.",
    "As the non-executive Chairman of Dankotuwa Porcelain, I would visit the factory every Saturday. I would leave home at 8 am sharp, and General Ranjan Wijeratne, the State Minister of Defence, who stayed close by, apparently also left for office at the same time. It was a regular feature that his motorcade would always overtake my vehicle opposite Hercules Tailors on Havelock Road.",
    "One particular Saturday I was not visiting the Dankotuwa factory because it was my son\u2019s birthday and I had to oversee many arrangements for the party for his nursery classmates. We were starting on the arrangements when a huge explosion was heard. It was a few minutes after 8am. Some of our window panes shattered under the pressure. The rebels had targeted General Ranjan Wijeratne with a bomb opposite Hercules Tailors. He was killed on the spot, and I wondered what miracle saved me that day.",
