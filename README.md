ඒ අනුව ලබන සඳුදා වනවිට එම තදබදය අවම කරගත හැකි වනු ඇතැයි රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍යවරයා විශ්වාසය පළ කරයි.

මැතිවරණයක් ආසන්න වනවිට වෘත්තීය ක්‍රියාමාර්ග සුලභවීම අපේක්ෂා කළ හැකි තත්ත්වයක් බවත් බහුතරයක් වෘත්තීය සමිති දේශපාලන ව්‍යාපාරයක් හා සම්බන්ධව පවතින බවත් අමත්‍යවරයා සඳහන් කළේය.

මුදල් රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍ය, ආචාර්ය රංජිත් සියඹලාපිටිය මහතා මේ බව කියා සිටියේ රුවන්වැල්ල රාජසිංහ විදුහලේ ගෘහස්ථ ක්‍රීඩාංගණය ඉදිකිරීමේ කටයුතු නැවත ආරම්භ කිරීමේ අවස්ථාවට එක් වෙමිනි.

වැඩවර්ජන යනු වෘත්තීය සමිතියක් විසින් ක්‍රියාත්මක කළ යුතු පළමු ක්‍රියාමාර්ගය නොව අවසාන ක්‍රියාමාර්ග බවද රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍යවරයා තවදුරටත් පැවසීය.

### Biden stands defiant on critical night - but gaffes mar fightback

Joe Biden took to the stage at his Thursday night news conference with everything on the line – his presidency, his re-election hopes, his political life.

If those were the stakes, he barely acknowledged them at the hour-long session to mark the end of a Nato summit, having earlier introduced Ukraine’s President Zelensky as “President Putin” at a separate event.

The news conference was his first unscripted appearance after a disastrous debate with his rival Donald Trump, leading to calls from several Democratic politicians and donors for him to drop out of the race for president.

Mr Biden, 81, has faced continuous questions over his age and ability to serve another term, which intensified after the debate.

But at the highly anticipated news conference, he dismissed the concerns about his campaign that were posed again and again by a room full of reporters, and promised that he was fighting not for his legacy, but to finish the job he started when he took office in 2021.

### Exploitation Of Desperate Hajj Pilgrims By Some Deceitful Hajj Agents

Hajj is a pilgrimage (spiritual duty) made to the Kaaba (the house of Allah) in the sacred city of Makkah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the first ten days of the holy month of Dhul Hijjah, the 12th month in the Islamic calendar. It is one of the pillars of Islam, along with believing (1) there is no god but Allah, (2) prayer, (3) almsgiving, and (4) fasting during the month of Ramadan. Hajj is not obligatory for every Muslim. It’s obligatory, at least once in a lifetime, for a Muslim if he is physically, emotionally, and financially able to perform. For anyone preparing to perform Hajj, it’s an incredibly exciting time because they believe that the first ten days of the month of Dhul Hijjah offer true Muslims the opportunity to gain immense rewards, have their sins forgiven, and reach great levels of piety. In other words, it offers the Muslims an opportunity to refresh their spiritual selves, cleanse them of their sins, and draw closer to Allah.

Professor GL Peiris criticizes the delay in deciding the presidential election timeline, questioning the president's term length due to legal ambiguity. Former President Maithripala Sirisena seeks clarification from the Supreme Court regarding his term under the 19th Amendment. A High Court ruling on the president's term leads to a call for suspending the election due to a constitutional conflict. Despite efforts, it's deemed impossible to finalize the draft on the president's term within the required timeframe.

Professor GL Peiris, a representative of the Independent People's Council and Independent Opposition MP, said that this is a waste of time.

Speaking at the postponement of the postponement debate on the presidential election in a timely manner in accordance with the legal arrangements in Parliament on Thursday (11), he said.

With the Supreme Court clearly issuing a clear regard to the president's tenure, is the president's tenure for five years?Or six years?That is explored.

Former President Maithripala Sirisena has sought the Supreme Court on his tenure.

The 19th Amendment of the Constitution was passed only after Maithripala Sirisena was elected president. The Supreme Court has given the Supreme Court that its arrangements will be considered the basic law of the country after the implementation of this amendment.

National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) said yesterday that the recent actions taken by the Sri Lanka Customs Officers’ Union, including a two-day “sick leave” campaign and work-to-rule initiatives, have had profound implications across Sri Lanka’s business community, particularly affecting exporters and importers. It said these actions were initiated due to perceived grievances and unmet demands from the Customs Officers’ Union on various issues.

NCE President Jayantha Karunaratne highlighted the significant disruptions caused by these actions. He emphasised that the work-to-rule approach has resulted in substantial delays in clearing imported goods at ports and checkpoints, causing disruptions in production schedules and logistical operations. These delays have particularly impacted exporters, who face stringent deadlines to fulfil international orders, leading to strained relationships with overseas buyers and potential financial penalties for missed deliveries.

### The presidential election has happened in a timely manner;Minister Ali Sabri confirms the House

*2024-07-12 01:41:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188261) · `ta`

Foreign Minister Ali Sabri confirmed that the presidential election in Sri Lanka will occur before October 17, adhering to constitutional requirements. Despite past delays, such as the 1981 referendum-induced postponement, elections have generally been conducted on time since 1931. The 19th Amendment reduced the presidential term to five years but didn't address the 83(b) clause, which could potentially affect future elections. The government is prepared for the upcoming election, highlighting achievements like uninterrupted power supply, increased tourism, higher public servant salaries, and enhanced dollar presence, assuring voters of a fair and timely process.

🟩

We are ready for the election. Foreign Minister Alisabri said the presidential election would be held before October 17, according to the Constitution.

He was speaking at the debate on the Motion on the Motion of the House on Thursday (11) in Parliament.

Whatever shortcomings in Sri Lanka, it is a country that has been continuously using the voting rights since 1931. Elections have been held in the country in a timely manner. Elections were not held in a timely manner. The election was postponed by the referendum in 1981. In this case, the election cannot be held.

The President's term of office was reduced to 5 years in the 19th Amendment of the Constitution. However in 83 (b) string is not mentioned in it. The idea has been brought to the cabinet to replace it. There is no need to doubt the presidential election. The election will be held before October 17.

Management’s role is to manage, and the board’s role is to oversee without killing the innovative spirit of management

Whilst in law, and on paper, a board is superior in rank to management, it is important that a board must never make the management feel inferior. Directors and executives must cohabit on a platform of collaboration, trust, and respect. The board-management relationship must be positioned as a value creating partnership where the board is humble in displaying some subservience to management’s technical, functional, and integrating expertise in running the company and the management appreciates the board’s advisory, guidance, governance, and oversight roles in increasing stakeholder value. A shared vision is vital and will result in management accepting the board’s untethered authority over selected aspects of the company

In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs

The EU and the US disburse significant amounts of money under the banner of doing good, and often mandate local partners with no subject matter expertise to drive programs on mental and sexual health, child welfare, nutrition and employee rights that do more damage than good to the future of our nation. When these are married to local individuals and organisations that give scant regard to the nation, its people and future; the outcomes can be perilous

The European Union and the US are amongst preferred export destinations, but winning buyers from these markets do not come easy. In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs. Hypocrisy and geo-political powerplay is rife, but cracks are slowly but surely beginning to show.

*2024-07-12 01:02:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-system-or-the-people/4-764161) · `en`

Whether a nation with this record can find the balance after a summersault of an attempted system change, only history will tell

From 1948, it has been an endless series of missteps, reflecting a national temperament which urges the path of backwardness and poor productivity. The emphasis was not on becoming a stronger or a wealthier nation, but on a hazy idea that all our ills are due to the nastiness of the system, there is this wealth somewhere in the country which should be distributed equally! A system must be created that feeds all the braggarts and the laggards (our Parliamentarians have already done this by voting in all kinds of benefits for themselves!)

A spectre is haunting Sri Lanka – the spectre of the NPP/JVP.

All powers of old Sri Lanka have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: A President without a popular mandate, a Government lacking credibility, political parties with tired faces, and businessmen with dark histories.

### Questions over the term of the President

Unsurprisingly the SC has dismissed the Fundamental Rights petition requesting the Supreme Court to hold that the President has a term of six years, in limine. Reportedly, the SC has found no merit in the petition.

If the term of office of the President had been interpreted to be six years, as the petitioner had sought, it would no doubt have been expressly in violation of the Constitutional provisions, limiting the President’s term to five years, introduced by the 19th Amendment.

What the petitioner had pleaded for was sort of a judicial review of post-enactment legislation by the Supreme Court, a power which the SC is not vested with under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It could hardly be surmised that the SC could arrogate to itself a power that is not vested in it by invoking any other doctrines of law, including inherent jurisdiction. However, the power of interpretation of the Constitution that lies with the SC is a power that it can use as it may deem fit.
