### SWRD, JR et al, tradition or mythology?

“Oh little monk, it is an arduous path you are taking…” on Martin Luther’s decision to challenge the papacy.

“The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like an incubus upon the brain of the living”

As the common saying goes ‘Success has many fathers but failure is an orphan’. And, in recent times, no other political career has been as successful as that of President Anura Kumar Dissanayake.

Hailing from rural Thambuttegama, with no pretension to so called Sri Lankan elite status, member of a putatively Marxist political party (an ideology seemingly out of step with the modern world in many aspects) and having received only about 3% of the general vote at the Presidential elections in 2019, Dissanayake yet won an emphatic approval from the voter in September 2024. His closest rival was more than a million votes behind. Prominent politicians, heralded for decades, would have turned green with envy contemplating the Dissanayake success.

Voters appear to prefer the blame game, pointing to anyone other than themselves

Over the past two years, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to many people across the country about what ails this land. On these occasions, I’ve always talked about what we as citizens have done (rewarded politicians who fostered the giveaway culture) and not done (failed to exercise any oversight in the time between elections). Almost always I get significant pushback. A common refrain is “we didn’t get fuel and electricity for free; we can’t be blamed for the fiscal deficit.” Citizens are blameless; the leaders are.

What lessons could the young generation learn from these oldies who with

After reviewing the economy’s performance during the first two years of its stewardship, IMF noted that without reforming governance, economic stability and economic growth would be slow and shaky. Although a noticeable measure of economic stability had been achieved the reviewers noted that growth prospect was still at knife’s edge. But even before IMF stepped into the scene the Aragalaya youth already identified the fundamental sickness that was debilitating the economy for decades and that sickness was bad governance.

An ethnonational majoritarian political culture with little or no room for meritocracy became the breeding ground for nepotism and corruption. That culture built a socio-economic and political system which in the end bankrupted the national treasury and along with it the national economy. Hence, the dire need for system change.

Some of the luxury vehicles used by previous administrations parked in Colombo – File photo

Do we need to rethink strategies for transport in ministries and State departments?

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake recently made an announcement on LinkedIn which said, “Advised to allocate luxury vehicles by previous administrations to essential services.” It seems there is a huge question and dilemma as to what needs to be done with these white elephant vehicles, which are high maintenance assets the Government is currently burdened with.

There were a host of comments following the President’s post. Since the post was on LinkedIn, a cross section of professionals were seen taking part in this conversation. Someone suggested, it might be beneficial to auction some of these locally to those who can afford luxury and upkeep. The funds could then be directed toward acquiring better, more fuel-efficient vehicles, possibly even performance hybrids to help reduce emissions.

UNITED NATIONS (IPS): As it continues to leave a mounting trail of death and destruction in Gaza, Israel has come under severe attack from the international community, including the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies, Western allies, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and scores of human rights experts.

During a conference in Paris, focusing on the new crisis unfolding in Lebanon, President Emmanuel Macron of France, a longtime Western ally and one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the UN Security Council, had “sharp words for Israel reflecting the view, even among Israel’s allies, that it has used excessive force against its enemies, resulting in disproportionate casualties and destruction,” according to the New York Times October 25.

“I am not sure you can defend a civilisation by sowing barbarism yourself,” Macron declared.

Through the results of the last Presidential election, the people of Sri Lanka have led the corrupt political forces that existed so far to a crucial defeat and opened the country to a new political journey through a Government of the National People’s Power. This is the result of the people’s struggle that unfolded throughout the recent past and a large propaganda intervention that influenced public opinion.

### Politics, garbage and pillow fights

*2024-11-01 01:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-garbage-and-pillow-fights/) · `en`

The ongoing US presidential race has got down and dirty so much so that trash and garbage trucks have been dragged into the propaganda war between the Republicans and the Democrats. The two sides are attacking each other, according to Rafferty’s rules. On Sunday, a comedian who spoke at a Republican rally happened to remark that US territory of Puerto Rico was a ‘floating island of garbage’ and unwittingly provided grist to the propaganda mill of the Democrats.

But two days later, President Joe Biden, true to form, made a gaffe; he said Trump supporters were garbage, and the Republicans seized on it to launch a massive counterattack, with Donald Trump going to the extent of travelling in the cabin of a garbage truck to a campaign rally, and condemning the Democrats, who provided the Republicans with a new line of attack and a rallying point.

The World Bank announced last week that ‘Sri Lanka’s economy has stabilized, with growth expected to reach 4.4% in 2024, surpassing earlier forecasts.’ This ‘good news’ has brought the political conversation to the ‘right’ path set in motion by the previous president and a sarcastic ‘kudos’ to the current president for moving in this path. In the past years where the country faced both the global and local polycrisis, macroeconomic stability has been the short term priority of all mainstream political parties. With defaulted loan repayments coming up in 2-3 years, carving a pathway for economic growth is now the next priority. Yet, what is this pathway and more importantly what is the pathway the citizens’ mandate for systems change is calling for?

There is a government that is not ready to compromise even on an inch of land in the country. With the needs of the 21st century, we are refreshing our army and security forces with modern resources. We would like to stop our army in the competition with the most modern army in the world. The basic purpose of this is the security sector gaining self -sufficiency.

We see 1 ground forces, 1 Air Force, 1 Sea. But we can see them as 111 according to them. ”The Prime Minister said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), a local corruption watchdog, has formally filed a complaint over appointment into Palmyrah Development Board (PDB) during the election campaign period, citing the move as violating the election laws.

The recent appointments made at the PDB in Jaffna “appear to contravene current election laws”, TISL said, citing that the ruling party has approved swift changes in several new board members as well as chairman twice within the gap of 12 days.
