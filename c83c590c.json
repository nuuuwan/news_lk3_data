    "The Budget 2023 included ambitious targets for Government tax revenue and expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, of 10.3% and 19.2%, respectively (as per Budget Speech 2023). Due to tax policy changes effective 1 January 2023, the tax revenue collection by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) for the first six months of 2023 was reported as Rs. 696,946 million as per press release issued on 12 July 2023. The total estimated tax revenue for the year 2023 as per the National Budget Speech 2023 was Rs. 3,130 billion out of which estimated income tax revenue was Rs. 912 billion.",
    "Income Tax collection in the first six months of 2023 has increased significantly when compared to the year 2022 due to WHT deductions, AIT and APIT on employment income being made mandatory. The total actual income tax collection in the year 2022 was Rs. 534 billion while in the first six months of 2023, the CGIR has already collected Rs. 382 billion. The taxes collected at source together with the changes in individual tax-free threshold, tax rates and slab revisions may have contributed for the increased collection.",
