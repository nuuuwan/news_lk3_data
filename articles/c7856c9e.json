The Bank\u2019s presence at the festival reinforced its dedication to strengthening cultural engagement and community support, while forging meaningful connections with people across the Northern Province.",

This outreach programme provided communities with valuable insights into Sampath Bank\u2019s wide range of financial solutions, while also strengthening relationships at a grassroots level.",
    "In addition, a five-day stall activation was held near the Nallur Temple, where visitors had the opportunity to learn more about the Bank\u2019s products and services.

Through its outreach and activations, the Bank shared insights into its products and services while engaging with people in an atmosphere that celebrated tradition and togetherness.",
