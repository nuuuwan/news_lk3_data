    "The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials on Tuesday discussing options to increase economic pressure on Russia, a source familiar with the discussions has told the BBC.",
    "Trump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on \u201cday one\u201d of becoming president, is struggling to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv and as Russia\u2019s strikes on Ukraine intensify.",
    "Separately, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he plans to talk to Putin on a call this week or early next week.",

    "Although the EU has said it would end its dependency on Russian energy, around 19% of its natural gas imports still come from there.",
    "If the EU does impose the tariffs on China and India it would mark a change to its approach of attempting to isolate Russia with sanctions rather than levies.",

    "Ukraine\u2019s main government building in Kyiv was struck by a Russian missile over the weekend - in an attack that was seen as both symbolic and a major increase of aggression by the Kremlin.",

    "On Tuesday, more than 20 civilians were killed by a Russian glide bomb in the eastern Donbas region, as they queued to collect their pensions.",
    "Trump said he was \u201cnot happy with the whole situation\u201d and threatened harsher sanctions on the Kremlin.",
    "The US president has previously pledged harsher measures against Russia, but not taken any action despite Putin ignoring his deadlines and threats of sanctions.",
    "A highly anticipated summit between the leaders in Alaska last month ended without a peace deal.",
    "Trump also said on Tuesday that the US and India were \u201ccontinuing negotiations to address the trade barriers\u201d between the two countries.",
    "He plans to speak to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks and expects a \u201csuccessful conclusion\u201d to their trade talks, he wrote on social media.",
    "In response, Modi echoed Trump\u2019s optimism that the talks would be successful and said the two countries were \u201cclose friends and natural partners.\u201d",
    "\u201cOur teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump,\u201d he added.",
    "Trump\u2019s comments have been seen by some as the latest sign of a reconciliation between Washington and Delhi, after a collapse in their trade negotiations.",
    "Last week, Trump emphasised the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between India and the US, saying \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion\u201d."
