    "Police are set to record statements from two senior officers as part of an investigation into allegations of misconduct during the 2019 arrest of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital Senior House Officer in the Gynecology and Obstetrics Unit, Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen.",
    "Dr. Shihabdeen, who was cleared of all charges this year, lodged a formal complaint with the Ministry of Public Security in early November, urging an investigation into the circumstances of his arrest and prosecution. He has claimed the accusations against him were fabricated as part of a deliberate conspiracy involving forged documents aimed at inciting communal tensions.",
    "Following the complaint, Acting Inspector General of Police Priyantha Weerasooriya ordered an inquiry into the matter. As part of the probe, statements will now be recorded from North Western Province Senior DIG Kithsiri Jayalath and Kandy Division DIG Mahinda Dissanayake.",
    "The investigation has revealed troubling details about Dr. Shihabdeen\u2019s arrest. On 25 May 2019, a team under the then North Western Province DIG Kithsiri Jayalath, apprehended the doctor, alleging he had performed unauthorised sterilisation surgeries on approximately 1,000 women. This dramatic claim was reportedly based on evidence provided by ten alleged victims.",
    "However, subsequent findings by the CID confirmed that nine out of the ten statements obtained by alleged victims were fabricated, with dates manipulated to appear as if they had been recorded before the arrest."
