    "From trade of illicit cigarettes alone revenue loss to Govt. stood at a staggering Rs. 79 b",
    "Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT) continues its groundbreaking efforts in shedding light on critical policy matters concerning Sri Lanka\u2019s economic landscape.",
    "Its latest series of reports highlights the significance of illicit markets that operate within and beyond the country\u2019s borders. Focused on combating illicit markets and their impact on the nation\u2019s economy, RIUNIT\u2019s latest policy papers aim to guide sound policy decisions crucial for bridging the country\u2019s revenue gap and fostering sustained economic development.",
    "RIUNIT\u2019s policy papers published in 2023 revealed a significant surge in the illicit tobacco sector, with illicit cigarette market share climbing from 16% in 2022 to 29%. Also, 62% of Tendu leaves used for beedi manufacturing appear to be smuggled. These increases in illicit trade are causing substantial revenue losses for the Government. From the trade of illicit cigarettes alone, the revenue loss to the Government stood at a staggering Rs. 79 billion. Additionally, RIUNIT found a considerable gap in tax revenue generated by different tobacco products like beedi, relative to their volumes. Despite beedi holding a 67% market share in the total tobacco market, they only contribute around Rs. 4 billion in tax revenue, representing a mere 3% of total tax revenue from the tobacco market.",
    "RIUNIT\u2019s research indicated that the Government implemented substantial increases in excise taxes on legal cigarettes in recent years, ranging from around 44-137% in 2023 alone. These tax hikes stretched consumer affordability and played a crucial role in causing consumers to shift towards cheaper illicit cigarettes.",
    "In addition, the rising cost of legal cigarettes became a strong incentive for consumers to seek more affordable options, often turning to illicit cigarettes. Furthermore, the ongoing decrease in real wages during this period significantly affected the affordability of legal cigarettes, making the illicit market even more appealing. Faced with economic challenges, many consumers sought more cost-effective alternatives, resulting in a noticeable increase in the consumption of illicit cigarettes.",
    "RIUNIT\u2019s report which centred on examining the economic and agricultural repercussions subsequent to the recent ban on the herbicide \u2018glyphosate\u2019 was also officially presented on the day. The report broke into the impacts resulting from the restrictions imposed on both the import quantities and usage of this herbicide. According to RIUNIT\u2019s estimations, roughly 1,156 metric tons of glyphosate found their way onto the island through smuggling in 2020. If these quantities were to be considered legitimate sales, the potential tax revenue for the year 2020 could have amounted to around Rs. 295 million. Additionally, the unregulated presence of smuggled or counterfeit weedicide products in the market poses substantial threats to the environment, farmers, and the food safety for consumers, warranting significant concern.",
    "At a juncture where Sri Lanka seeks to increase tax revenue amidst pressures from the IMF and the all-important need to stabilise the national economy, RIUNIT highlights the pivotal role of tackling illicit markets to safeguard the government\u2019s financial stability. Targeting key policymakers critical in steering the country\u2019s economic trajectory, RIUNIT\u2019s focus encompasses drivers and impacts of illicit markets related to agriculture, alcohol, tobacco, and counterfeit goods.",
    "RIUNIT Sri Lanka CEO Roshan Madawela emphasised the importance of addressing the significant fiscal deficit prevalent in Sri Lanka. He highlighted the indispensable need to tackle illicit trade that causes significant revenue loss to the State, and is crucial to ensure the country\u2019s financial stability. He added that addressing the leakages in the tax system should be addressed as a matter of priority rather than shifting the entire tax burden on working people.",
    "The most recent discoveries outlined in the illicit markets policy papers were introduced by the RIUNIT Research Analyst Mihin Perera and the reports were presented to the State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe.",
    "Following the report launch, an in-depth panel discussion took place, featuring Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation CEO Major General (Retd.) G. Vijitha Ravipriya, Advocata Institute Chairperson Murtaza Jafferjee, Construction Industry Development Authority Director Dr. Chithra Weddikkara, and Heineken Lanka Ltd. Finance Director Samanthi Kariyawasm as panellists."
