Before detonating their vehicle in the southwestern city of Quetta, six attackers who were inside the car stepped outside and engaged troops in an intense shootout, police said.

People living in the area said the blast was so powerful it was heard from miles away.

Dozens were also wounded and taken to hospital after ambulances rushed to the site in front of the Frontier Constabulary.

No group immediately claimed responsibility, though suspicion will fall on separatist groups that often target civilians and security forces in insurgency-plagued Balochistan, where Quetta is the provincial capital.

Provincial health minister Bakhat Kakar said there were fears the number of people killed could rise.

Local television channels and CCTV footage from the site of the explosion shows a car stopping in front of the gate of the paramilitary compound.

### Chinese woman convicted in UK after ‘world’s biggest’ bitcoin seizure

*2025-09-30 13:32:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113071/chinese-woman-convicted-in-uk-after-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-seizure) · `en`

A Chinese national has been convicted of playing a key role in what is believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world, worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn).

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court, London of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.

Between 2014 and 2017, she led a large-scale scam in China by cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

The Met said the 47-year-old’s guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web.

A total of 61,000 bitcoins were seized from Qian, the Met said.

The police said the probe began in 2018 after they got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets.

Qian had been “evading justice” for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met’s investigation.

US President Donald Trump’s H-1B visa crackdown will hasten United States firms’ shift of critical work to India, turbocharging the growth of global capability centres that handle operations from finance to research and development, economists and industry insiders say.

The world’s fifth-largest economy is home to 1,700 global capability centres, or more than half the global tally, having outgrown its tech support origins to become a hub of high-value innovation in areas from design of luxury car dashboards to drug discovery.

Trends such as growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing curbs on visas are pushing US firms to redraw labour strategies, with global capability centres in India emerging as resilient hubs blending global skills with strong domestic leadership.
