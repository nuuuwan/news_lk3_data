### My markers in the fight for four decades

*2024-08-22 02:00:49* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c3ej1y059gno) · `si`

Given the comprehensive overview of Sri Lanka's presidential elections, it's clear that each election has been marked by unique challenges, including political instability, violence, and issues related to voter turnout, especially in regions affected by conflict. The 2023 presidential election faces its own set of challenges, including the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, and ongoing social issues.



To address these challenges effectively, the new President must prioritize several key areas:



1. **Economic Recovery**: Focus on stabilizing the economy, addressing inflation, and ensuring financial stability for all citizens. This includes implementing policies that support small businesses, agriculture, and job creation.



2. **Reconciliation and Unity**: Given the historical context of ethnic and religious tensions, the new President should champion initiatives aimed at national reconciliation, healing wounds, and promoting unity among all communities. This could involve truth and reconciliation commissions, educational reforms, and policies that ensure equal rights and opportunities for all.



3. **Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Measures**: Strengthening institutions, improving transparency in government operations, and implementing robust anti-corruption measures are crucial. This includes reforming the judiciary, enhancing fiscal responsibility, and ensuring accountability across all levels of government.



4. **Addressing Social Inequalities**: Work towards reducing socio-economic disparities, ensuring access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services for all segments of the population. This involves investing in social welfare programs and infrastructure development in underprivileged areas.



5. **Promoting Democracy and Human Rights**: Uphold the principles of freedom of expression, assembly, and the rule of law. Engage in dialogue with opposition parties, civil society organizations, and international partners to strengthen democratic institutions and practices.



6. **Environmental Sustainability**: Address environmental concerns, including climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Implement policies that promote sustainable development, protect biodiversity, and ensure the well-being of future generations.



7. **International Relations and Diplomacy**: Strengthen diplomatic relations with other countries and international organizations. Seek partnerships for trade, investment, and cooperation in areas like technology, health, and security.



8. **Security and Law Enforcement**: Ensure the safety and security of all citizens, particularly in regions previously affected by conflict. Work towards demilitarization and civilian control of the security apparatus, while maintaining the ability to respond effectively to threats.



By focusing on these areas, the new President can address the multifaceted challenges facing Sri Lanka and pave the way for a more prosperous, peaceful, and united nation.

🟩
