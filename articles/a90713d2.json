    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has firmly stated that the present government remains consistently committed to safeguarding Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sovereignty, and that there is no intention at any time to hand over the electricity sector to private entities.",
    "The President emphasized that ensuring control over the country\u2019s energy sector is a key government policy, given its critical role in economic development, national security, and national independence.",
    "President Dissanayake further noted that the government\u2019s objective is not to privatize but to eliminate the existing inefficiencies within the institutional structure of the electricity sector and to establish a streamlined, well-regulated institutional framework.",
    "President Dissanayake made these remarks while attending a progress review discussion on the ongoing electricity sector reforms, held today (22) at the Presidential Secretariat.",
    "Speaking at a discussion held with members of the committees appointed for power sector reform, and directors of the newly established state-owned companies, the President emphasized the urgent need for a new institutional framework to replace the outdated structures of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).",
    "\u201cThe existing system is no longer sufficient. The need for reform is undeniable,\u201d said the President, highlighting the goal of ensuring reliable and affordable electricity to the public, while maintaining Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty over its energy resources.",
    "President Dissanayake assured that no employee will face a reduction in salary or position, employee rights will be fully protected, any unresolved matters involving the CEB will be addressed before integration into the new entities and all existing rights and assets of the CEB will be secured under the new structure.",
    "The President emphasized that institutions exist to serve the public, not merely their employees, and the reforms aim to deliver a more efficient, uninterrupted power supply at a fair price. If this is achieved, it will be a victory for both the government and the employees, the President said.",
    "The meeting also featured extensive discussions on the challenges and suggestions related to the reform process."
