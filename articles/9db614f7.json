    "The results of Thursday\u2019s parliamentary election were still trickling in as this is being written on Friday but it was clearly evident that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s NPP/JVP, or the Malimawa (Compass \u2013 its election symbol) as it is best known, has clinched a historic victory winning better than a two thirds majority in the 225-member legislature. They won all but the Batticaloa district, a stupendous performance by any reckoning and Sri Lanka must hope that the rulers will deliver on the faith reposed on it by the whole country and all its ethnic and religious communities.",
    "Though AKD polled less than 50 percent of the total votes cast at last September\u2019s presidential election, he was comfortably ahead of his nearest rivals, Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Apologists for both the losers attempted to devalue the victory by saying 48 percent of the electorate voted against the winner. They were of course conveniently ignoring the glaring fact that his opponents did worse. Much worse.",
    "It was perhaps the numbers game that fueled the belief and hope among some opponents of the Malimawa that all was not lost with the executive presidency going elsewhere. They hoped for a parliamentary majority either individually or collective only to have those hopes shattered on Thursday. The executive presidency which was the fount of almost all ruling power was installed by President J.R. Jayewardene after his landslide five sixths majority election of 1977.",
    "It must be remembered that JRJ swept to power on the basis of the easier previous first-past-the-post Westminster system of government where the winner takes all. The old fox instituted the proportional representation (PR) system of elections where the losers have a stake, with the conviction that there would never again be landslides. But he was proved wrong even before Thursday\u2019s momentous performance by the NPP/JVP.",
    "What is perhaps most extraordinary in this Malimawa victory is that the NPP/JVP took the Northern constituencies as never done before by southern party. AKD had a very successful rally in Jaffna in the days before the election and it was reported that a leading Tamil politicians had alleged that the president\u2019s party had bused Sinhala people for that event \u2013 a common practice in Sri Lanka electioneering. A leading member of the winning combine said said after the result that this was a blatant falsehood and the results probably proved him right.",
    "Tamils can vote for Sinhala candidates and did so in the past. Older readers will remember that Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa, running on the SLFP ticket after Mrs. Bandaranaike was disenfranchised, against President JR Jayewardene in this country\u2019s first presidential election in 1982, did very well in the north. JRJ was constitutionally \u201cdeemed\u201d president in 1978 having swept the parliamentary election a year earlier but was not elected as president the first time round.",
    "Kobbekaduwa\u2019s success in the north when he ran for president was attributed to his banning, as agriculture minister, the import of onions and chilies earning northern farmers growing these crops windfall profits. In fact he was garlanded with onions and chilies when he campaigned in the north.",
    "The electoral success of those who will govern this country for at least the next five years holds out the very real prospect that Sri Lanka will at last be able to successfully address the long festering communal problem. In the country\u2019s first general election in 1947, the UNP which governed till 1956 was able to field candidates in the Tamil majority areas and win some seats. Though elected on the All Ceylon Tamil Congress ticket, Mr. GG Ponnambalam served the first DS Senanayake cabinet. When Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake in 1965 formed his seven party coalition, derisively dubbed the  hath havula by his opponents, Mr. M.Tiruchelvam, a retired Solicitor General, was nominated by the Federal Party to serve in the cabinet.",
    "But with the Dudley \u2013 Chelvanayakam Pact failing like the Bandaranaike \u2013 Chelvanayakam Pact before it, there was a tendency for only cosmetic presence of so-called \u201cColombo Tamils\u201d like Mr. Chelliah Kumarasuriar in Mrs. Bandaranaike\u2019s time, to serve in the cabinet. For sure President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga used the National List to bring a man of high caliber, Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, to parliament. He was made foreign minister and it is unarguable that he was the finest this country ever had during a most difficult phase in its history. It has been credibly reported that CBK wanted to make him prime minister but that effort was successfully thwarted by Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "But all this can change now and it remains to be seen how President AKD and his government will seize this opportunity. Abolishing the executive presidency was one of its pledges. Many of his predecessors promised to do so and welshed on their solemn undertakings. Will AKD, holding the powerful office, seek to abolish it or in the interim clip some of its wings? His promise to do away with the unnecessary and extravagant retirement benefits of former presidents have struck a responsive chord with the electorate.",
    "More than any other, his promise to rid the country of endemic corruption and bring the guilty to book, was widely welcomed. It is well known that many of this country\u2019s leaders have participated in or consorted with corruption. While totally eradicating it at all levels of society will be a Herculean task, ridding it at the top will be less difficult. The new president and his party undoubtedly have the will. But will they have the way?",
    "We have always taken the view that too powerful governments and too weak oppositions are dangers to democracy. The electorate has vested the new president and his administration with near absolute power that must be circumspectly used in the national interest. The losers too must realign and for a start whether the UNP and SJB can reunite is an inevitable question.",
