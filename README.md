From left: Former CTTA Chairman Anselm Perera, CTTA Chairman Sanjay Herath, PA Secretary-General Lalith Obeyesekere, PA Chairman Senaka Alawattegama, PA Spokesperson Dr. Roshan Rajadurai, PA Media Committee Chair Shanaka Samaradiwakara, All Island Federation of Tea Smallholder Development Societies Chairman Jagath Pathirana

The tea industry veterans warned that the Ceylon Tea brand would face irreparable damage in international markets, leading to both decline in auction prices and global market share, if the government forced the plantation companies, including the smallholder sector, to implement the unprecedented 70 percent minimum wage hike arbitrarily.

Speaking at a press conference held in Colombo yesterday, industry veteran and former Colombo Tea Traders Association Chairman Anselm Perera termed the ‘arbitrary and reckless’ wage hike to be the fourth major crisis of the Ceylon Tea industry in post-independent Sri Lanka.

### Despite the end of the war

*2024-05-28 02:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184650) · `ta`

Despite peace since 2019, the aftermath remains dire, especially in the North, where schools remain damaged and the community hasn't reaped peace's benefits. The Leader of the Opposition criticizes the lack of justice and fulfillment of promises, highlighting the need for digital education to strengthen the nation. He emphasizes the importance of IT education and plans to equip schools with smart classrooms and install Women Development Centers to empower both genders technologically.

🟩

The war ended on May 18, 2019. Although 15 years have passed since the end of the war, we cannot be happy with the situation of the North. After the end of the war, the community did not even get the benefit of peace.

If the benefits of peace were right, the schools here must have become national schools. Here we do not seek national schools shrinking with the name board.But nothing like that happened here.

Even in these areas, there are schools that have been destroyed by war. 15 years after peace. How many times did you vote for the winning of the war. We still cannot show the cause of war.

The Leader of the Opposition said that justice for the area and the students of the area has not been upheld.

In a history where promises are not fulfilled, I can only give pure confidence to the affected people who have lost their confidence in politics. The opposition leader said that he was the only opposition in the true meaning of the word and carried out services for the people.

Veteran politician and former Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Anuradhapura district MP Tissa Karaliyadda officially joined the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) over the weekend.

Karaliyadda joined the SJB after meeting with party leader Sajith Premadasa in Polonnaruwa on Saturday. Premadasa was in town for a party rally when he welcomed Karaliyadda into the SJB. The event was also attended by SJB MP Rohana Bandara.

Karaliyadda entered Parliament representing the Anuradhapura district and has served as the Cabinet Minister for Child Development and Women’s Affairs, as well as the Minister of Indigenous Medicine.

The veteran politician found himself embroiled in controversy in 2015 when a photograph of him alongside underworld figure Iron Ranasinghe, alias SF Loku Malli, a prime suspect in the murder of nightclub owner Wasantha de Zoysa, went viral. At the time Karaliyadda denied any connection to Ranasinghe and the murder of de Zoysa in Anuradhapura.

He noted that the SJB has therefore proposed dates for debates involving both the Economic Councils and Leadership to the NPP. However, he expressed disappointment that the NPP has yet to respond to the request for the Economic Council debate.

We know that three people are currently contesting the presidential election. After the release of the trio's election manifesto, we will decide who will support it.

At the same May Day meeting, Sajith Premadasa said he would fully implement 13.

When I met him in parliament in this regard, I heard. He said it would be if it would have the police land authority.

I told him that I told him that during the last presidential election, you said that you could give more than 13 more than 13.

### 2,000 people feared buried under Papua New Guinea landslide

The landslide occurred in the mountainous Enga region in northern Papua New Guinea on Friday and the latest figure is a sharp rise from earlier estimates.

Soon after the disaster occurred, the United Nations said as many as 100 may have died. That was later revised up to 670, according to estimates from the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country.

But that may now be a major underestimate according to the latest projection from Papua New Guinea’s disaster agency.  “The landslide buried more than 2000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,” National Disaster Centre Acting Director Lusete Laso Mana said in a letter to the UN.

### Debt and taxes: Can we hide our heads in the sand?

Unless we ask more and better questions of those who want to rule us, history may repeat

A few days ago, I attended the launch of a policy platform by an organisation called Piripun Deshayak where the audience included at least one Presidential Candidate. I was quite surprised that the document (and the presentations) made no mention of debt or taxes.

Saubhagyaye Dakma, the policy platform developed for Gotabaya Rajapaksa by Viyath Maga was a disaster, but it addressed both debt and taxes. That was in the good old days of 2019.

In these darker times how could anyone propose actions, including significant public investments, to make Sri Lanka a developed nation by 2040 without addressing these key issues, I wondered. Where was the money, once the debts were serviced?\

### Economic stability with SOE reforms need system change

Is there a more fundamental reason that permitted SOEs to operate without accountability, burden public finance, contribute to economic crisis and misallocation of resources?

The Head of Emerging Market Economies Johanna Chua, when commenting recently on Sri Lanka’s emerging economic stability under IMF direction made a crucial point that “people” should “feel” the stability after paying a heavy price for it. But she failed to identify those people she was referring to. IMF being an institution created by and for the affluent never cared for the poor and downtrodden. It is a class biased institution predominantly interested in maintaining the stability of the capitalist system with its financial structure.

### Israel reportedly agrees to  resume talks

Under international pressure Israel has reportedly agreed to resume talks on a solution to the Gaza crisis. Widespread support for Palestine, the ruling of the ICJ, arrest warrants sought by the ICC and US prodding have forced Israel to bend, even if only slightly.

Times of Israel (TOI) reported last week that Israel, the United States and Qatar have agreed to renew talks on a hostage deal and truce with Hamas, the paper said. Talks were suspended in April.

TOI further said that the fresh negotiations will be based on a new outline negotiated in Paris by CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Chief David Barnea, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.

In line with this, the Israeli war Cabinet expanded the mandate of the team negotiating a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas, TOI said.

### Overall decline in April PMI

*2024-05-27 23:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/overall-decline-in-april-pmi/) · `en`

Sri Lanka Purchasing Managers’ Index for Manufacturing (PMI – Manufacturing) recorded an index value of 42.0 in April 2024, indicating a contraction in manufacturing activities following the seasonal pattern. New Orders, Production, Employment and Stock of Purchases sub-indices declined during the month, resulting in an overall decline in the index.

As per the respondents, the decline in New Orders was mainly due to the end of the festive season’s demand, particularly for food & beverages. Further, the decrease in Production was primarily due to the fewer working days in April, as most factories were temporarily closed for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays. Moreover, Employment and Stock of Purchases decreased during the month, in line with the decline in New Orders and Production. Meanwhile, Suppliers’ Delivery Time further lengthened in April, owing to the extended holidays in the month.

Remarkably, none of the political parties or even the public officers who run to the Supreme Court at the slightest hint of an appointment against their expectations, have even raised a query on this crucial appointment made without any transparency. One can only wonder then, if they were all in collusion
