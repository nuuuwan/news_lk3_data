    "Sri Lanka State Trading Corporation announced that a consignment of 15 million eggs will arrive in Sri Lanka today (17) in order to meet the demand during the festive season, following the granting of approval for the import of eggs.",
    "Meanwhile, the corporation said it has made arrangements to distribute 10 million quality-assured eggs already imported to Sathosa outlets today.",
    "Although an egg was sold at a rate between Rs. 40 and Rs. 50 earlier this month, it was reported that eggs are currently being sold at prices between Rs. 55 and Rs. 65 in the local market.",
    "As the local egg producers have failed to bring down the exorbitant prices despite being notified, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando on Saturday (16) granted permission to import eggs from India until April 2024, in a bid to control the unreasonable increase in the price of eggs in the local market.",
    "The decision came after egg producers had informed the minister that eggs could not be sold at a price below Rs. 55 each until the end of Christmas."
