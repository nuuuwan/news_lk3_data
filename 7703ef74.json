  "original_body_lines": [
    "The opposition has decided to appoint a \u2018genuine\u2019 alternative committee to formally investigate all parties responsible for the country\u2019s economic collapse, as opposed to the Parliament Select Committee (PSC) appointed for the same purpose.",
    "In a media release, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa deemed the PSC chaired by MP Sagara Kariyawasam \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201croguish\u201d, accusing it of pretending to investigate the causes of the country\u2019s bankruptcy.",
    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya\u2019s leader said the government, without heeding the main opposition\u2019s proposal seeking the appointment of a PSC to identify the causes for the economic collapse, has appointed a panel at its sole discretion with a majority of members \u201cwho are only shadows of its track record of dishonesty\u201d.",
    "The PSC appointed on July 06 consists of MPs Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, Attorney-at-Law, D. V. Chanaka, Vijitha Herath, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Eran Wickramaratne, Ashok Abeysinghe, Jayantha Ketagoda, Harshana Rajakaruna, Major Pradeep Undugoda, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda, Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam and Prof. Ranjith Bandara.",
    "Premadasa accused the government of selecting the same people who were responsible for the \u2018economic crime\u2019 in the country and bankruptcy of the country to investigate the causes which led to this situation.",
    "\u201cIt is very clear that the main objective of appointing this Select Committee is to acquit the people responsible for bankrupting the country,\u201d the opposition leader said adding that it is futile to work with such a committee which he deemed a waste of time and an act of betrayal of the country\u2019s citizens who were affected by the economic collapse.",
    "The SJB leader said the committee, to be appointed by the opposition, would take steps to formally look into all parties responsible for the economic collapse and to report to the parliament.",
    "\u201cAny Member of Parliament may contribute and support in good faith for the functioning of this committee.\u201d",
    "Premadasa said the opposition\u2019s committee intends to identify those who are responsible for the economic crisis with \u201cfull transparency, accountability and responsibility.\u201d"
