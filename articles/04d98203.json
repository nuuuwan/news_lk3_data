    "National Development Bank PLC (NDB) has received a Second-Party Opinion (SPO) from Sustainable Fitch for its Sustainable Bond Framework (SBF), marking a significant step in NDB\u2019s commitment to sustainable finance. The SPO, which provides an independent assessment of NDB\u2019s framework, has rated the alignment of the bank\u2019s sustainability bond framework as \u201cGood\u201d based on internationally recognised principles and guidelines set forth by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).",
    "The Sustainable Bond Framework enables NDB to finance or refinance projects under several green and social categories that support Sri Lanka\u2019s national goals for environmental protection and social advancement. These include seven green use of proceeds (UoP) categories such as renewable energy, green buildings, clean transportation, and climate change adaptation, as well as four social categories, including affordable infrastructure and employment generation. Sustainable Fitch\u2019s validation confirms that NDB\u2019s approach to sustainability bonds aligns with key principles and guidelines of ICMA.",
