Speaking to the media, he said the appointment of the new government has broken the political heritage that has been a generation.

"Therefore, the posts of Basnayaka land and Divadana land in Buddhist Vihara and church organizations should no longer be limited to the same lineage or generations," he added.

He also urged the government to evaluate their income, as Sampath has reported a lot of problems with the financial management of churches.

Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has extended his deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at the age of 100.

Posting on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), Dissanayake said former U.S. President Carter’s extraordinary life was marked by an unwavering commitment to peace, human rights and humanitarian  affairs in recognition of which he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

“May his legacy live on as a beacon of hope to build a better world for all”, he added.

Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as U.S. president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday.

Carter lived longer than any U.S. president and, after leaving the White House, earned a reputation as a committed humanitarian.

### Elon Musk stirs up controversy over AfD boss Alice Weidel’s Sri Lanka partner

ECONOMYNEXT – Donald Trump supporter Elon Musk has stirred up a controversy over his remarks about the partner of Alice Weidel, a top leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been promoting nationalism.

Musk in an op-ed published in Germany’s  Welt am Sonntag newspaper said that AfD is not as extreme as claimed by critics as its co-chair had a same sex partner.

Nationalists are usually against the gay community, as was Hitler’s Nazi party.

“The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Musk wrote in the op-ed, according to the German broadcaster Deutshe Welle.

Wiedel is said to have a same-sex partner in Switzeraland who is a migrant from Sri Lanka.

The Welt’s opinion editor had resigned shortly after the publication, the report said.

### Number of school days in 2025 reduced

*2024-12-30 09:07:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104575/number-of-school-days-in-2025-reduced-) · `en`

The Ministry of Education has announced a reduction in the number of school days for 2025, lowering the annual total from 210 to 181 days.

This decision comes in the wake of numerous public holidays and delays in the commencement of the first school term. The revised schedule applies to government schools, government-approved private schools, and Pirivenas.

To accommodate the academic calendar, schools will open on January 2, 2025, for the final three weeks of the third term of the 2024 academic year, concluding on January 24. The new school year will officially commence on January 27, 2025.

According to the Ministry, the 2025 calendar includes 26 public holidays, with 22 of them falling on weekdays. The high number of weekday holidays significantly reduces the number of days available for regular school sessions, making it impractical to adhere to the original 210-day schedule.

### Former US president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter dies at 100

Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as U.S. president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday. He was 100.

Carter, a Democrat, became president in January 1977 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East.

But it was also dogged by an economic recession, persistent unpopularity and the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office. Carter ran for re-election in 1980 but was swept from office in a landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.

On 26 December, an HRCSL delegation had visited the Air Force Base intending to investigate the condition of the detainees. However, Air Force officials denied access, stating that approval from the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration was required.

72 Virgins – Uncensored was a Telegraph channel run by the Israeli Defence Forces’ Influencing Department (Orwellian by name and by deed). According to an expose by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the channel promises Israeli audiences “exclusive content from Gaza” – gory videos of death and destruction visited on Palestinians recorded by their IDF perpetrators. An example: “Burning their mother…” exults an October 11, 2023 post; “You won’t believe the video we got! You can hear the crunch of their bones. We’ll upload it right away, get ready”.

### It would be useful to consider how far Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, who has been an MP for a long time has been able to move forward and reach  his goals by adopting his ideologically stubborn political stance so far.

There was a stir in political circles when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who met with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake during his recent official visit to India and had a joint press meeting in New Delhi after talks with him, failed to say anything about the 13th Amendment (13A) to the Sri Lankan Constitution.

Sri Lankan Tamil political parties and their leaders did not show as much concern about it as the media and political observers did. Modi, who had always emphasised the need for the Sri Lankan Government to fully implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in his press conferences with previous Sri Lankan Presidents, avoided it this time, which seemed particularly different.

Referring to multiple interactions with Indian leaders over the decades which started in his role as an assistant to former president J.R. Jayawardene, he said,” When you have been in politics as long as I have, you end up knowing everyone – at some point or the other.”

“I have also been an eyewitness to the pivotal and sweeping economic metamorphosis of India from the late 1990s onwards.”

### Astonishing Levels Of Corruption

*2024-12-29 23:44:11* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/astonishing-levels-of-corruption/) · `en`

Unless the scourge of corruption is at least controlled, if not eliminated, our country is doomed. In the absence of genuine effort, no amount of big talk of “Yahapalanaya”, “Eradication of Beeshanaya and Dhooshanaya”, “Vistas of Splendour,” are all hollow deceptions, and an insult to our collective intelligence. Let us demand that the currently pledged ”System change” is truly meant, and will not merely join the lengthy queue of deceptive treachery.

There is much excitement that at long last, some action will be forthcoming. The early signs are very positive. May this continue as a sustained battle against grave injustice. The people deserve this; and are tired of hoodwinking slogans and pretended “Cleanliness”. Times and moods have changed and the “Aragalaya” was a mild fore taste of what determined and disciplined, massive public protests can do. All beware!

### Billions Of Tsunami Aid Disappeared Without A Trace; Corruption Even In Human Misery

Local media highlighted the twentieth anniversary of devastating Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004 and snatched way almost one percent of the Muslim population. However it failed to highlight how billions of tsunami aid disappeared without a trace.

According to reports, tsunami victims didn’t get any aid and they did not know where the aid money went. Some reports stated that money was feverishly transferred not only to government establishments, but also to accounts of individuals, companies and charity organizations.

Sri Lanka’s then deputy executive director of the anti-graft organization Rukshana Nanayakkara said: “It was almost impossible to find out what happened to the cash. According to an initial government audit only 13 percent of the aid was spent during the first year of reconstruction, but since then there has been no formal examination of accounts.”

### NPP needs to get serious about industrialisation to avoid another crisis

Speaking in Parliament on 18 December, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pledged that under the leadership of his party, “we will never allow a situation like 2022-23 to reoccur in our country”. If AKD and the National People’s Power (NPP) intend to keep this promise, they will have to get a lot more serious about industrialising an economy dependant on services and remittances.

It is regrettable that the President’s speech, while announcing welcome relief for the poor through tax cuts, allowances and subsidies, paid scant attention to increasing investment in the real economy. This is a deadly trap that centre-left governments often fall into. Naturally, the wretched conditions following economic collapse require immediate relief measures. However, long term increases in consumption can only be achieved through investment in the real economy.

### AKD and ETCA with India: Trap or opportunity?

ETCA is a way forward for Sri Lanka to harness the benefits of international trade for creating prosperity to Sri Lankans

According to the 34-point agreement which President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, AKD for short, had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi or simply Modi, the two countries have agreed to promote, among others, trade and investment between them1. There are three agreements that are strikingly prominent and promising. One is that they have agreed to continue discussion on economic and technological agreement, shortened as ETCA, which is now in an abortive state. Another is the direct use of Indian Rupee or INR and Sri Lanka Rupee or LKR for transactions thereby avoiding the intermediate exchange currency, the US dollar. The third is for India to invest in sectors that will increase Sri Lanka’s export potential. All these are interrelated and should naturally form the core of any ETCA to be negotiated.

### Country moving over to renewable energy

The Government needs to submit a plan to encourage installation of solar power by individual homes and the industry, with reduced interest loans from commercial banks

The country has almost exhausted its cheapest power hydro-electricity. Only possibility is major movement towards solar power, especially by small and medium scale industries and house owners. Most convenient new solar users would be factories and offices, who normally work during day-light hours. Also, most schools have fans in the classrooms. They could install solar panels on the roofs, eliminating electricity bills. The parents who installed the fans in classrooms could also install solar panels

### Good governance a pre-requisite for economic development:  Mr. President, you are on right path

AKD and the NPP Government must stay objective and must resist undue interference of these third parties in making decisions which are in the best interest of the country

There is a continuation of policy at least in the short term. There is no immediate disruption. Trying to do too much in too short a time invariably leads to disaster. The NPP Government is the first in recent times to continue with the economic policies of the previous regime. All this, in my eyes, points to a desire on the Government’s part of putting the country first rather than blindly following an ideology. My advice to the Government is to focus on governance reform. The economy will take care of itself in the short term

The recently launched “Clean Sri Lanka” Program under the leadership of the President has generated significant attention. As someone deeply engaged in ocean sustainability efforts for nearly a decade, I commend this initiative as both timely and impactful. It represents an essential step toward fostering sustainable practices for a healthier ocean.

For the past eight years, we have demonstrated practical methods for creating and maintaining a sustainable ocean environment. However, a pressing issue that must be addressed is the prevention of plastic waste from entering our oceans. One effective solution we identified is the installation of “trash traps” to intercept plastic waste carried by water streams into the sea.
