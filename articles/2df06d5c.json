    "Former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s ringing endorsement of US presidential hopeful Kamala Harris a couple of days back at a Democratic Party convention may have dramatically improved the latter\u2019s chances of clinching the Democratic Party nomination for the forthcoming US presidential election. Clinton\u2019s oratory, it was evident, was of the highest quality.",
    "If many Democratic Party supporters entertained reservations over Harris\u2019 suitability for the nomination, they ought to have been dispelled a great deal by Clinton\u2019s persuasive power and verbal eloquence, although Harris would continue to face criticisms over crucial policy questions.",
    "As matters stand, though, it is Harris who would be overwhelmingly garnering the US\u2019 liberal-democratic vote. She is yet to take up and examine with any thoroughness economic issues currently confronting the US public but it goes without saying that it is Harris who is capturing the imagination of the average US voter, given her dynamism and vibrancy in comparison to the jaded Donald Trump. In the words of Hillary Clinton, she could very well be having Trump \u2018on the run.\u2019",
    "However, complex issues loom for Harris not only on the economic policy front but in the foreign policy sphere as well. With regard to the latter, for instance, Harris is reportedly coming under pressure from some Democratic Party quarters to declare the military action currently initiated by Israel in the Gaza and adjacent regions as \u2018genocidal\u2019. Unreserved support for her from her camp would depend on how effectively Harris meets this foreign policy challenge.",
    "Harris has reportedly talked tough to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the spiraling Gaza blood-letting but she would be ushering a near paradigm change in US policy on the Middle East by choosing to pronounce Israeli-initiated Palestinian civilian deaths as \u2018genocidal\u2019.",
    "A related issue is, how she would be managing the rising calls to her from her supporters to describe the relevant Israeli actions as \u2018genocidal\u2019 and shape US policy for the Middle East accordingly.",
    "However, there is no denying, considering the Israeli-inspired disproportionately high Palestinian civilian death toll in the Middle East currently, that the violence in question is of a genocidal nature. Maybe, Harris could from now dialogue increasingly closely with the Israeli political leadership and caution it against persisting strongly with a military solution to the Gaza conflict rather than adopt a more nuanced and flexible policy to the tangled question. Harris is obliged to tell the Israeli political establishment that US support for Israel could be highly conditional, going forward.",
    "These conditions would need to be of a costly nature in view of Israel\u2019s seeming obduracy but the latter\u2019s concerns would need to be factored into future US policy making on the Middle East as well. It is plain to see that Israel\u2019s security needs should be taken cognizance of by the US and Israel\u2019s adversaries in the region. If Israel\u2019s future security is not fully guaranteed by these quarters, Israel could not be expected to desist from using military means to ensure its security.",
    "Thus, highly complex issues confront the US and other states seeking to bring about a cessation of hostilities in the Middle East. Civilians on both sides of the region\u2019s divide cannot be allowed to be victimized on any score but the security requirements of Israel may need to be stringently respected and met by all parties to the conflict.",
    "The Two State Solution, whatever its limitations, remains the only rational way out of the Middle East blood-letting but patient diplomacy would need to be engaged in by a future Kamala Harris administration to bring the concept to fruition. However, the most immediate requirement is a ceasefire that could establish the basis for a cessation of hostilities. That is, the current violence needs to cease at least temporarily. After all, peace-making is inconceivable amid continuing hostilities that tend to harden attitudes among the adversaries.",
    "However, a notable development is a rising tendency on the part of sections of the Israeli public to hold their political leaders responsible for increasing Israeli civilian casualties. Proof came of this trend recently when relatives of some five Israeli hostages who were apparently killed by Hamas castigated the Netanyahu regime for bypassing scores of opportunities to bring the hostages back home in time.",
    "Provided the Netanyahu regime opts for a diplomatic solution, it would not be far-fetched to foresee a situation in the near future when more and more sections of the Israeli citizenry would be turning against their government for failing to make peace with its adversaries and curtail the bloodletting.",
    "However, given its ultra-nationalistic orientation and its corresponding power base, the Netanyahu regime has no choice other than to wage war. In the process, it would need to be increasingly repressive to keep power. In doing so, the regime would earn the wrath of the public, thus, setting the stage for stepped-up domestic discord.",
    "The supreme irony in this turn of events cannot escape the perceptive observer. This consists in the fact that the Netanyahu government could prove to be increasingly fascistic, in the nature of the Hitlerian regime that sadistically victimized the Israelis in the lead-up to the Second World War. In both cases, ultra-nationalism has proved the catalyst in stepped-up state repression and fascism. Not to be missed out on is the fact that the Netanyahu regime\u2019s military action in the Gaza and outside is beginning to smack strongly of genocide.",
    "Thus, a future Harris administration faces a compounded crisis in the Middle East that has deeply humanitarian overtones. It cannot remain idly by and allow its strong ally in the Middle East to commit excesses that have come to be seen by influential quarters as genocidal. If it does so, it would be seen as aiding and abetting in genocide. Besides, the Harris administration\u2019s inaction would earn for it the moral disapproval of civilized sections. It would need to act fast and constructively before long.",
    "An incoming Harris administration would have no choice but to bring pressure on the Netanyahu government to change course and work towards a political settlement in the Middle East, although it would have to do so with the utmost restraint and patience. It would also need to encourage to the extent possible pro-peace and democratic sections within Israel. A Harris administration should do so in consideration of the fact that the Israel public would be doing itself immense good by voting in governments that are democratic and pluralistic in outlook and antithetical to ultra-nationalism.",
