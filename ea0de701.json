  "original_body_lines": [
    "If there was a prize offered for the country that has the most number of beauty pageants, we would win it hands down\u2026easily and decisively.",
    "I don\u2019t think anywhere in the world do we see these beauty pageants cropping up like mushrooms, as it\u2019s happening in Sri Lanka.",
    "At the drop of a hat\u2026hey presto\u2026and another pageant makes its appearance, and with insignificant titles, too.",
    "Before long, we may see Miss/Mrs./Mr. Figure of the Earth, Face of the Earth, Miss/Mrs./Mr. Titanic, and such titles being announced.",
    "And, who knows, since various titles for beauty pageants are conjured up, on a regular basis, we may even have some bright spark coming up with a beauty pageant for Miss/Mrs./Mr. TikTok, or even Miss/Mrs./Mr. Tuk-Tuk\u2026perhaps, even Miss/Mrs. Kalagedi! Nothing is impossible in our \u2018land like no other.\u2019",
    "This was on social media, and, whoever created it, is absolutely correct:",
    "\u201cSri Lanka has more beauty pageants than all the pageants put together around the world. Just saying\u2026\u201d",
    "* Oh yes, and most of the crowns are cemented to fake queens head, too.",
    "* Some of them utterly ridiculous, with no proper finesse, and totally worthless.",
    "* Most of them, in reality, are just 4feet no inches. Thanks to those who designed those 7inch heels.",
    "Probably, we are not only looking at only creating a world record for beauty pageants but also to have Sri Lanka come up with a Guinness World Record!",
    "Are these pageants of any benefit to our country?\u2026that\u2019s the question being asked by many.",
    "And, what\u2019s more, the winners, at some of these pageants, lack the necessary qualifications to represent Sri Lanka at an international event.",
    "One gets the impression that our girls are not ready to take on the international scene where beauty pageants are concerned. And that\u2019s probably why they are eliminated so early.",
    "We need to come up with a formula to \u2018produce\u2019 a winner worthy of representing Sri Lanka at a world beauty contest. I believe most of our girls are not fully aware of what is needed to take on the world!",
    "Of course, there have been, and I still see, some beauty pageants being organised in a very professional way.",
    "What we need to do is to concentrate on beauty pageants that are prestigious the world over and not waste time on pageants that have no importance, whatsoever.",
    "If we can grab one of these titles \u2013 Miss World, or Miss Universe \u2013 it certainly would be a big boost to our beauty queen industry.",
    "On several occasions I have, in my articles, mentioned that the state, or some responsible authority, should step in and monitor these events \u2013 lay down rules and guidelines, and make sure that everything is above board.",
