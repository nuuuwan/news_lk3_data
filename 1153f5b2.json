  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says over 500,000 families will receive allowances for disabilities, kidney diseases, and the elderly",
    "Reveals identification process recognises 1.1 m new families as suitable recipients of \u201cAswasuma\u201d",
    "Informs total of 990,000 appeals, 70,000 objections received so far",
    "States efforts are underway to make first payment within this month to all eligible candidates who have not faced any objections or appeals",
    "Asserts Govt. is committed to creating a seamless transition for individuals in need",
    "State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe revealed this week\u00a0 that 70% of Samurdhi beneficiary families who applied for relief will be included in the \u201cAswasuma\u201d welfare program.",
    "The program aims to provide relief to two million families, surpassing the number of 16.8 million Samurdhi beneficiary families.",
    "In addition, over 500,000 families will receive allowances for disabilities, kidney diseases, and the elderly.",
    "\u201cOf the 1.28 million (1,280,747) Samurdhi families who applied for \u201cAswasuma\u201d benefits, 70% or 887,653 families have been deemed eligible,\u201d he said via Twitter yesterday.",
    "The State Minister also said the identification process has recognised 1.1 million new families as suitable recipients of the \u201cAswasuma\u201d benefits.",
    "\u201cSo far, the program has received 990,000 appeals and 70,000 objections, indicating the active engagement of the public in the selection process,\u201d he added.",
    "The \u201cAswasuma\u201d program serves as a vital support system for vulnerable families, providing them with much-needed relief during these challenging times. By expanding the coverage to include additional families beyond the Samurdhi beneficiaries, the Government aims to address the needs of a broader segment of society.",
    "On Wednesday, the State Finance Minister told journalists that arrangements have been made to commence investigations about these appeals and objections received by the Divisional Secretaries under the supervision of District Secretaries.",
    "\u201cIn a directive from President Ranil Wickremesinghe, it has been decided to execute the current list of beneficiaries receiving differently-abled, elderly, and kidney support allowances without making any changes. This decision will remain in effect until a new system is implemented within the next three to six months,\u201d he said.",
    "Semasinghe said the Government aims to ensure uninterrupted support for those currently receiving these allowances.",
    "\u201cEfforts are underway to make the first payment within this month to all eligible candidates who have not faced any objections or appeals. The Government is committed to promptly investigating these appeals and objections. If the investigations confirm the eligibility of the appellants or their families to receive the \u201cAswasuma\u201d allowance, their entitlement for July will be combined with the August allowance and disbursed accordingly,\u201d he explained.",
    "He said from 1 August, individuals who were unable to apply for the \u201cAswasuma\u201d program this year or failed to submit appeals will have another opportunity to do so. The Government aims to ensure that all eligible individuals are included in the welfare system without excluding anyone or causing disruptions to their current benefits.",
    "The State Minister also noted that the intention behind the \u201cAswasuma\u201d program is to incorporate eligible individuals and low-income groups into the welfare system without discontinuing any benefits they are currently receiving.",
    "He asserted that the Government is committed to creating a seamless transition for individuals in need and ensuring their well-being through the provision of essential support."
