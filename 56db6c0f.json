    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka may have an early power tariff revision mid-January 2024 that will see electricity rates reduced to reflect the increased use of hydropower generation made possible by unusually high rainfall, according to Power Minister Kanchana Wijesekara.",
    "However, Wijesekara told reporters Wednesday December 13 morning that, he is not in a rush to make a premature announcement as it will be up to the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the regulator, to analyse the data provided by the Departments of Meteorology and Irrigation and arrive at a decision.",
    "Explaining the process, Wijesekara said the government had decided that CEB tariffs should be revised twice a year, on January 01 and July 01. Following the latest revision in July 2023, forecasts and projections have changed, he said.",
    "In the wake of the July 01 tariff adjustment, he said, there was a severe drought in August.",
    "\u201cThe CEB uses data provided by various government agencies such as the Met Department and the Irrigation Department. As you know, this cannot be done in a day or two; it can only be done following a forecast for at least the next three months,\u201d he said.",
    "By October, Wijesekara said, it was assumed that the CEB would be facing a massive loss, but the Met Department had informed the utility provider that the drought would return in October by the end of which there will be floods, at the end of that same month. The Met Department had then told the CEB that there was no sign of further rain after November 15, and Sri Lanka was to face another drought in the first three months of 2024.",
    "\u201cThese forecasts have changed. Globally and locally. Though it was said there would be no more rain after November 15, it was in fact on November 15 that we recorded the highest single-day rainfall. In December, it doesn\u2019t usually rain this way. Now there is rain daily which has allowed us to use hydropower to the maximum,\u201d the minister said.",
    "In the wake of this development, he said, the next tariff revision that was due in April can be brought forward to pass the benefit to the consumer.",
    "\u201cAs we pass on losses to consumers we must also pass benefits on to them,\u201d he said.",
    "On December 31, said Wijesekara, once the CEB\u2019s balance sheets have been finalised, the state-run institute may be able to go for a fresh revision mid-January.",
    "\u201cThe way it looks now, it seems prevailing tariffs can be lowered. But I don\u2019t want to rush. Available data and information must be obtained by the CEB and relevant individuals must do the needful together with the PUCSL,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Dec13/2023)"
