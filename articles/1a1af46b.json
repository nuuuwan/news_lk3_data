    "COLOMBO (News 1st); His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, delivered a scathing critique of Sri Lanka\u2019s past leadership and societal decline, stating that the country\u2019s collapse was not accidental \u2014 but the result of a systemic failure of ethics, accountability, and justice.",
    "Leading with moral skepticism, the Cardinal warned that a society without principles is destined to fall, and that Sri Lanka\u2019s current crisis stems from a long-standing erosion of values across all levels of leadership.",
    "\u201cFrom the highest ranks to the grassroots,\u201d he said, \u201ca culture of corruption, theft, and selective justice has dragged the nation into ruin.\u201d",
    "He pointed to the absence of policy direction, integrity, and respect for law, noting that despite Sri Lanka\u2019s natural beauty and potential, the country has become one of the most indebted in the world.",
    "\u201cHad we used our borrowed resources wisely,\u201d he said, \u201cSri Lanka could have surpassed even Singapore. Instead, we are left with a broken system and a suffering population.\u201d",
    "Cardinal Ranjith emphasized that 70% of Sri Lankans now live in poverty, not because of external forces, but due to internal failures \u2014 particularly the normalization of corruption and the lack of equal application of the law.",
    "\u201cJustice must be for all,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just for the powerful.\u201d",
    "He also criticized the self-serving nature of modern society, where personal gain overrides national interest, and where even religious values are reduced to ritual rather than lived ethics.",
    "\u201cReligion is not just about temples, churches, or shrines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about living according to moral and spiritual principles.\u201d",
    "Calling for a return to honest, policy-driven governance, the Cardinal urged leaders and citizens alike to embrace truth, justice, and ethical responsibility.",
    "\u201cWe must earn wealth,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we must do so with integrity. That is the true teaching of our faiths.\u201d"
