He also led Harris by about 5 million votes in the popular count.

“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.

Dangerous two-thirds majority for JVP: Son warns against electoral disaster.

🟩

Wijeweera, son of JVP's founder Rohanavijayaweera, has warned that it is a dangerous thing to provide a two -thirds majority to the national popular power.

The general secretary of the second generation of the party, Uvindu Wijeweera, said that the issuance of a two -thirds majority to the JVP in the upcoming parliamentary election would be a political disaster.

He has appealed to voters to be cautious about the consequences that the JVP gets two -thirds.

After gaining a major majority in the 1977 general election, JR Jayawardene recalled the political tactics that JR Jayawardene advanced, said Rohana Wijayaweera's son, not to bear such a situation.

I do not think that the declaration of the national people's power to defeat corrupt politicians to clean up the parliament is wrong, but it is not right for voters to be elected only members of the national people's power at this moment.

He has appealed for voters not to be killed by the propaganda of the national people's power.

Republican Donald Trump claimed victory in the 2024 presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.

Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly on Wednesday.

### Republicans win control of US Senate, make gains in House

Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate with victories in West Virginia and Ohio on Tuesday, ensuring Donald Trump’s party will control at least one chamber of Congress next year.

Republicans also posted early gains as they battled to retain control of the House of Representatives.

But Tuesday’s results ensured Republicans would be able to help Trump appoint conservative judges and other government personnel if he wins the presidential race, or block much of Democrat Kamala Harris‘s agenda if she prevails.

Republican Jim Justice was projected to win an open Senate seat in West Virginia shortly after polls closed, taking over the seat previously held by Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent. In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno was projected to defeat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown.

Those two victories ensured Republicans will hold at least a 51-49 majority in the Senate, with further gains possible as results in other competitive races come in.
