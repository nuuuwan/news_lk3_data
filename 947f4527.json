    "He expressed the vision of creating an environment where future generations can live free from fear or doubt.",
    "The resolute stance articulated by Minister Tiran Alles signals the government\u2019s dedication to combating these issues for the betterment of the nation\u2019s security and stability.",

Special responsibilities have been assigned to community police committees in this regard.",
    "\u201cThe success of this operation hinges on the support of the people, particularly the media.

While the Three Decades\u2019 War was confined to the North and East, the current situation has spread throughout the entire country.",

    "\u201cPrior to commencing this operation, discussions were held with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who shares the stance that drug trafficking and underworld activities must be eradicated from the country.",
