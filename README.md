ECONOMYNEXT – A Women’s Caucus in Sri Lanka’s parliament has commissioned a survey on gender pay gaps with the intention of bringing legislation to narrow the gap, the group’s Chairperson Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle said.

“We are conducting a survey to identify the places that have a gender pay gap, so we can bring in necessary legislation to minimise it,” Fernandopulle said during a debate to pass a bill on Womens’ Empowerment.

Though salary scales in the government sector are equal regardless of gender, it is not so in the private sector.

“Women are paid less than men for doing the same job.” Equality has not been achieved by appeals alone and legislation was necessary, she said.

“No matter how advanced our women are thanks to free education and free healthcare, their participation in formal employment is still at 35 percent.”

While state agencies set equal pay, women in decision making roles were still low within them, Fernandopulle said.

June 05 - A gunman was captured after opening fire at the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, on Wednesday — an attack that took place as U.S. ally Israel signaled it could soon launch an offensive in the country against Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned early Wednesday that Israel was "prepared for very intense action in the north," as he visited a border city hit by wildfires sparked by Hezbollah rockets.

The escalation has piled pressure on Netanyahu from right-wing members of his government, who have also threatened to quit if he agrees to the U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal. President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu in an interview published Tuesday, but also dispatched top aides to the region for new talks with mediators as Washington pushes for a deal that would end eight months of fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.

On Wednesday, two allies in his National Democratic Alliance coalition, the Telugu Desam Party, a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal (United) which rules the northern state of Bihar, pledged their support.

The federal cabinet met on Wednesday morning and recommended the dissolution of parliament, a constitutional formality before Modi can form a new government.

### Sri Lanka has been allowed to boycott international law for more than 15 years - who have been atrocited international crimes against Eelam Tamils

*2024-06-05 12:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185354) · `ta`

Sri Lanka has evaded international law for over 15 years, committing atrocities against the Eelam Tamils. The Tamil Eelam government calls for recognition to ensure accountability. ICC lawyer Karim Khan is commended for seeking the arrest of Israeli and Hamas leaders for war crimes. International legal experts affirm that no conflict can evade legal repercussions. Despite evidence of mass killings, no military personnel have faced charges. The UN highlights the failure of domestic efforts for justice, suggesting international mechanisms are necessary. The Eelam Tamils urge the ICC to indict Israeli and Hamas leaders, citing the court's recognition of Palestine's right to justice. They reject Sri Lanka's constitution based on sovereignty principles and assert their right to self-governance and prosecution of war crimes under the Rome Statute.

🟩

The recognition of legal Tamil Eelam will lead to accountability on the island of Sri Lanka, the Tamil Eelam government said.

The Transnational Tamil Eelam government praises the International Criminal Court (ICC) lawyer Karim Khan for a bold action for the arrest of Hamas and Israeli leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister, for crimes and war crimes against humanity.

We again underlined that international law and armed struggle laws apply to all, as the prosecutor Karim Khan said.. No army nor any commander can act without any punishment for crimes.

International legal experts, including former International International Criminal Court Judge Theodore Meron and Amal Clooney, have said in their statement, "No war can escape the hands of the law."

It is a painful fact that Sri Lanka has been allowed to boycott international law for more than 15 years, which has committed atrocities against the Eelam Tamils.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka parliament’s Committee on Public Finance has concluded its examination of a visa deal with IVS-GBS-VFS Global, a private company, its chairman Harsha de Silva said.

Officials of the Public Security Ministry who had not come to an earlier meeting was present on June 04, he said.

“IVS-GBS VFS visa matter was concluded,” de Silva said in an x.com message. “Our report will be presented at the earliest. As I have maintained throughout, I shall not discuss substantive issues until then.

The VFS Deal led to hikes if visa fees and additional charges, including undisclosed fees being charged from tourists.

The website is also complex and puts off some visitors, compared to the user-friendly website operated by the Department of Immigration earlier, the tourist industry has said.

Following protests by Tourism Minister Harin Fernando, a 50 dollar visa has been re-introduced. (Colombo/June05/2024)
