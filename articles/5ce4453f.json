    "Our purpose in this world is to choose the resurrection where we join with Christ and seek his power of thought to restore our minds to its original glory",
    "Birth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it \u201cperceptually\u201d witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who \u201chave sinned and come short of his glory.\u201d But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind",
    "The resurrection of Christ is the corner stone of Christian mystical thought. As such, there are no neutral or idle thoughts for the spiritual seeker. In this way, all thought produces form at some level but they are either true or false. For the spiritual aspirant, the resurrection, correctly speaking, is the highest level of thought; for it acknowledges that there is no thought but God.",
    "Christ\u2019s thinking differs from mortal man\u2019s insofar as the latter dissipates his creative energy by thinking of everything else other than God. Christ is one-mindedness and his creative energy is a constant in God and his mind is filled with no thought but God. Our ordinary senses depict a world of duality whereas all mystical experiences overcome this dichotomy. The Bible uses a term such as to \u201cknow\u201d God which is similar to an experience of unspeakable love. A close parallel to understanding this concept was documented by Huxley after having ingested a hallucinogenic substance when he thereupon experienced becoming the flower he observed \u2014 breaching the dichotomy between the observer and the observed.",
    "In some religious disciplines, meditation, which is replete in Buddhist scripture has the purpose of attaining one-mindedness or a state of stillness as a prelude to enlightenment. Thus, the body becomes neither a hindrance nor an aid to in this process. Purpose is.",
    "In Christian thought, the resurrection is about transcendentalism of the body. To be body-conscious and to identify one\u2019s self with the body is an unnatural state for those in quest for the kingdom of God. As thought produces form, lower vibrational thought is expressed as dense matter being physical in nature, whereas, in a higher state of consciousness, it engenders spiritual light and translucency of energy. Spells cast on people or even demonic possessions of people occur to them resonating at lower frequencies, but, for them who are on a higher plane, those spells boomerangs on the initiator. The black arts work only against people who have already condemned themselves and who operate at the lower level of the psychical field.",
    "For this reason, it is important to understand that the original sin of man \u2014 or the decent from a sublime plane to a lower one \u2014 represents the mind\u2019s decision to replace the Knowledge (thought) of God with perception. In the latter realm, the body symbolises the expression of a perceptual state of separation from God and every-body, which is experientially real. The \u201cword,\u201d therefore, cannot in a real sense become flesh because the word is God (higher plane) whereas the flesh (lower plane) is outside the domain of His kingdom. The closest analogy to reconcile the irreconcilable is God is light (the word) and in Him there is no darkness (the flesh).",
    "But in experience, the physical plane is very real with souls (light) appearing to be trapped in bodies (matter). No wonder, Einstein\u2019s famous equation E= MC2 equates matter to being trapped light! On the other hand, when translucency is attained the resurrection restores this misperception by raising the thought vibration where the physical and material are completely undone. Thus, \u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d the Holy Bible proclaims with certainty and clarity.",
    "Most religions either exalt the body or condemn its purpose. Some exalt its beauty while others scorn its appetite. Worse still, in meditation, some focus on its impermanence, corruptibility and disintegration while others venerate its supposedly strange powers and abilities. This preoccupation with the body makes the error real and diverts the energy of the spiritual aspirant. Such extreme distortions actually happens from a psychological standpoint of resistance or fear to mask the true nature of man \u2014 who is Spirit \u2014 and, therefore, this action perpetuates the sense of victimisation and vulnerability and, in some bizarre way, justifies this notion to be true. In contrast, the resurrection demonstrates invulnerability.",
    "By unnecessarily focussing on the body, the mind continues to harbour lower frequency thought forms with self-aggrandisement of needs. The only way out of this dilemma is the middle path prescribed by Lord Buddha: we must neither exalt nor degrade the body but use it as an instrument to transcend its earthly trappings so that we re-align the purpose of mind to attune with its true nature of being while relinquishing the ego.",
    "Concepts such as Absolute Reality where nothing but God exists is difficult to grasp in post-separated world. In contrast, this post-separation world is based on perception, and the mind is highly variable and always uncertain. This uncertainty always demands a need to fill the vacillating mind with illusory thoughts. In a group study of behavioural perception, a renowned psychologist played a chanting of, \u201cThat is embarrassing!\u201d several times. Then he scripted a message on the screen while the same chant was played, \u201cThat isn\u2019t my receipt,\u201d and the audience were bewildered to hear that this same chant fitted the words on the screen. The eyes take on an electrical signal based on expectations and reconstructed the chant to fit the message. He concluded that we see nothing that is real but that we construct our own false reality.",
    "To correctly perceive the body, we should become aware that it exists outside the mind. Properly speaking, the mind of man is a function of the Mind of God. Here there is no dichotomy and thus cause and effect are therefore really one and the same thing. Since God has no body, man yet believes he exists as a body but he is free to believe infinitely even in a lie no matter how strong the impression is. Strictly speaking that thought is an illusory one, at any rate. Therefore, from the mystical perspective, we cannot accord the body any reality because only God is Real. Either the body exists or God ceases or vice versa.",
    "Focussing wrongly on the body in this sense is a barrier to knowing God. Yet God is not mocked according to St. Paul. This may run contradictory to formal beliefs, but there are compellingly reasons to see it in another light. As the body is a separation device, \u201cThe wages of sin is death.\u201d The resurrection is therefore the overcoming of death, which is simply the re-establishment of the separated mind with that of God\u2019s. It is akin to a state of oneness-joined-as-one.",
    "Birth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it \u201cperceptually\u201d witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who \u201chave sinned and come short of his glory.\u201d But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind. Accordingly, the Bible says, \u201cIf you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye, shall say unto this mount, remove hence to yonder place and it shall be removed and nothing shall be impossible.\u201d",
    "The practice of mindfulness is therefore essential to the path of redemption. Here a reversal of thought \u2014 cause and effect \u2014 is urgently required so that what was an external infliction is no longer perceived that way but is instead perceived as a projection of mind. All misperceptions have to be healed within the mind, for there is no external world \u201cout there\u201d to adjust and manipulate. This idea also resonates with modern scientific thought.",
    "In summary, it must be understood that the body is a projection of a misthought \u2014 an illusory thought, so to speak. Only thoughts, which are in accord with God\u2019s, are Real whereas all others are outside His Realm. Once a misthought is corrected \u2014 or the sleep of forgetfulness which weaves a dream-like world is undone \u2014 it inevitably gives rise to the \u201cwakened\u201d state of mind akin to the resurrection.",
    "In this wakened state was Jesus crucified on the cross. Logically, if you take a cause and show it has no effect then the cause ceases to exist. The body symbolises the separation (effect), but when Christ demonstrated that the resurrection was possible, he reversed cause and effect thus reestablishing the relationship between man and God. As a result, man is no longer under the spell of the separation or bondage but is set free from bondage if he now chooses so.",
    "Our purpose in this world is to choose the resurrection where we join with Christ and seek his power of thought to restore our minds to its original glory."
