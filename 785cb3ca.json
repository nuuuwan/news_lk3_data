    "COLOMBO (News 1st); From Monday (19), the UK\u2019s Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) comes into effect.",
    "UK High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Sarah Hulton OBE tweeted that Sri Lankan exporters can now trade with the UK tariff-free on 92% of goods.",
    "The UK's Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) is a new trade scheme that came into effect in January 2023.",
    "The scheme provides duty-free, quota-free access to the UK market for goods from developing countries. Sri Lanka is one of the 65 countries that are eligible to benefit from the DCTS.",
    "The DCTS is expected to have a positive impact on Sri Lanka's economy and is expected to increase Sri Lanka's exports to the UK. The DCTS is also expected to help Sri Lanka diversify its exports and reduce its reliance on a few key commodities.",
    "The scheme will provide Sri Lankan exporters with a competitive advantage in the UK market. The scheme is also expected to help Sri Lanka integrate into the global economy and achieve its development goals.",
    "From Monday 19 June 2023, the UK is implementing one of the most generous preferential trading schemes in the world. Sri Lanka is one of 65 countries benefiting from the UK\u2019s Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) which provides tariff reductions and simpler terms of trade. The scheme was announced last year, and legislation has now been finalised to bring it into force.",
    "The British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Sarah Hulton OBE said: \u201cThe UK is Sri Lanka\u2019s second-largest export market and the DCTS demonstrates the UK\u2019s continued interest in strengthening this trade relationship. We hope that Sri Lankan exporters will broaden their opportunities with the UK by making use of the wider number of products for which tariffs have been removed. The DCTS is a tangible example of the UK\u2019s commitment to growing free and fair trade with countries like Sri Lanka, boosting economies, and supporting jobs.\u201d",
    "Speaking at the launch of the scheme, UK Minister for International Trade Nigel Huddleston said: \u201c[The scheme] will create opportunities for businesses around the world, supporting livelihoods, creating jobs and diversifying local and international supply chains.\u201d",
    "The DCTS allows Sri Lanka to now trade with the UK tariff-free on 92% of goods, leading to increased competitiveness of Sri Lankan products in the UK market. Sri Lanka is well positioned to supply the UK due to increasing demand for sustainable, fair-trade, and healthier products. With more flexible rules of origin, it is easier for least developed countries to trade with Sri Lanka without losing tariff-free status, increasing the potential for supply chain development.",
    "To support business take-up of the DCTS, the UK Trade Partnerships Programme (UKTP) has expanded and now covers Sri Lanka. UKTP provides technical assistance to almost-ready-to-export small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and is delivered by the International Trade Centre (ITC). The programme will primarily provide trade promotion technical assistance to a selected number of Sri Lankan SMEs, preparing them to participate successfully in international trade fairs. This will improve the visibility of Sri Lankan producers, equip exporters with the necessary tools and knowledge, and facilitate their entry into new markets.",
