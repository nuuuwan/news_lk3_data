    "Accuses President of treating Constitutional Council as an agency under his authority",
    "Emphasises necessity for an extensive discussion on issue within Sri Lankan society",
    "Says action of Govt. could lead to a crisis in governance and it must be stopped",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member and parliamentarian Prof. Charitha Herath issued a warning yesterday, expressing concern about an impending constitutional crisis in the country.",
    "The MP said that in each constitutional amendment since the 17th amendment to the constitution, there has been deliberation on limiting the powers of the Executive, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Constitutional Council under the 21st Amendment to the Constitution.",
    "Commenting on the necessary composition of the Constitutional Council, Herath pointed out that, at present, members from opposition parties, excluding the primary opposition party, have yet to be appointed to the council.",
    "He observed that although President Ranil Wickremesinghe has put forward the President of the Court of Appeal for a vacant position in the Supreme Court, there is a divided opinion within the Constitutional Council.",
    "\u201cConsequently, the President addressed the issue in a recent parliamentary statement, expressing a perception that the Constitutional Council was established to assist the Executive in its functions,\u201d he remarked.",
    "Highlighting opposition from others, Herath emphasised the necessity for an extensive discussion on this issue within Sri Lankan society.",
    "\u201cHe not only conveyed these sentiments but also suggested the formation of a parliamentary select committee to investigate the actions of the Constitutional Council. Additionally, a media report has disclosed that the President has suspended the printing of a gazette pertaining to a 40-page manual outlining the procedures of the Constitutional Council. The potential appointment of a select committee further reinforces my belief that there are indications of an imminent constitutional crisis,\u201d he said.",
    "Herath noted that the Constitutional Council was proposed by the United National Party led by Wickremesinghe and the common belief is that the Council was set up by UNP-led Governments to give some power back to the Parliament from the Executive.",
    "\u201cHowever the President has deviated from this and is acting in a manner treating the Council as an agency under his authority. This could result in a crisis in governance. This must be stopped,\u201d the MP said."
