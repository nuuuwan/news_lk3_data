  "original_title": "Strengthening governance in Sri Lanka: Case for an External Policy Review Board",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The proposal for the EPRB marks a proactive step toward not only refining the quality of governance but also upholding the principles of transparency and accountability foundational to our democratic ethos",
    "While Sri Lanka is commendably moving toward better governance, there remains room for substantial improvement. Enhancing our policy-making processes is critical for continuing this forward momentum. The proposed establishment of an External Policy Review Board (EPRB) offers a significant opportunity to deepen our commitment to transparent and effective governance.",
    "The EPRB, as envisaged, would be comprised of 10 interdisciplinary experts, each bringing a depth of knowledge essential for the nuanced evaluation of Government policies. This board would operate as a confidential advisory body, providing independent reviews and recommendations directly to the President and policy framers. This structure is designed to ensure all Government and citizen-initiated policies undergo rigorous scrutiny, aligning with national and international standards.",
    "Improved policy quality: The diverse expertise within the board ensures that all policies are meticulously vetted, leading to stronger, more effective governance measures.",
    "Enhanced transparency and accountability: While the board\u2019s deliberations would be confidential, the mere presence of such a review mechanism serves as a testament to the Government\u2019s commitment to transparency. This process demonstrates to the public that policies are not only crafted but also reviewed under the highest standards of scrutiny.",
    "Increased public trust: By implementing a system where policies are thoroughly evaluated before enactment, the Government reassures citizens of its dedication to their best interests and to governance that genuinely serves the public good.",
    "Cross-disciplinary innovation: The interdisciplinary nature of the EPRB can foster innovative solutions to policy challenges. By bringing together experts from diverse fields such as economics, environmental science, technology, and social policy, the board can facilitate the cross-pollination of ideas. This diversity can lead to more creative and effective strategies that might not emerge from within a single department or perspective, helping policies to be more adaptable to complex modern challenges.",
    "Mitigation of biases and special interests: One of the inherent challenges in policy-making is the potential influence of special interests and inherent biases within departments. An external, independent review board like the EPRB can act as a check against these influences by providing unbiased assessments of policies before they are implemented. This can lead to more equitable and fair policies that serve the broader interests of the population, rather than specific groups or industries.",
    "Streamlining decision-making for leaders: By conducting thorough and expert-driven reviews before policies reach the desks of the President and Parliamentarians, the EPRB significantly simplifies their decision-making process. This preemptive review ensures that the higher echelons of government receive well-vetted and refined proposals, reducing the burden on them to identify potential errors or areas of concern. This streamlining can lead to quicker, more confident decision-making, facilitating faster implementation of policies that have already been scrutinised for quality and effectiveness.",
    "Enhancing the legitimacy of Government actions: The presence of an independent review board like the EPRB enhances the legitimacy of Government policies in the eyes of the public and international observers. When policies are known to have undergone rigorous, impartial review by a panel of experts, it reinforces the perception that these policies are not only sound but also crafted in the public interest. This can strengthen national and international confidence in the Government\u2019s actions, improving its standing and effectiveness both domestically and abroad.",
    "Confidentiality is crucial in the operations of the EPRB to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of the advisory process. It allows for honest, unfiltered advice from experts, free from external influence or public pressure. This secrecy is pivotal, not only for protecting the integrity of the deliberations but also for ensuring that recommendations are crafted with the sole aim of policy effectiveness.",
    "The proposal for the EPRB marks a proactive step toward not only refining the quality of governance but also upholding the principles of transparency and accountability foundational to our democratic ethos. As we await the President\u2019s decision, there is a hopeful anticipation that this initiative will significantly improve our governance framework, enhancing public trust and affirming Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to exemplary governance."
