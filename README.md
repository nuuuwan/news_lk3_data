The new voting structure ensures that voting rights are determined solely based on the level of cricket played by each member club, with all qualified clubs and associations being entitled to only one vote. This marks a pivotal step towards equitable representation and streamlined decision-making.

Further, in order to strengthen the transparency in financial management, the membership unanimously approved the establishment of the Audit Committee, Investment and Budget Committee, and Related Party Transactions Committee, the statement added.

Ulama Corp criticizes MP Rishad Badidin over claims about Al-Alim exams. They argue against equating Moulavi qualifications with Al-Alim certifications, citing unfair treatment of Moulavi teachers. The party demands Rishad retract his statement.

üü©

The Paradise Member of Parliament, Rishad Badidin, has said that it is the ignorance of the party that has said that Al -Alim's examination is the only one who is the author of the Moulavimar as teachers.

Al -Alim said in a press release sent to the media regarding the exam.

The reason for the creation of the Almighty It does not mean that the smaller is better than the rim.

But then Rishad Badiudeen and Rauf Hakim were the ministers who were ministers, and the Moulavi editor of the Moulavi Editor to the Editor. Since then, the Ulama Party has been in the process.

If a person who has been held at the GCE high -rise, the teacher's appointment is available for three years at Kalvikkaluri.

But if a Moulavi is available for a Moulavi, it is the great injustice it is to Moulavi to pass the Moulavi and end the GCE high -level and to pass the Al -Alim exam.

"Two former MPs agreed to recommend liquor store licenses without contesting recent elections. 361 licenses issued, sparking political bribery allegations. High Court case pending on district liquor store limits."

üü©

Two of our MPs agreed that they were allowed to set up liquor stores. Jaffna has not contested the election. Former parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran said.

He said this while participating in a press conference held at the Jaffna Vadamarachchi Media House in VM Road in Point Pedro on Thursday (19).

Each district has a definition of liquor schools permits.. But they did not contest the election this time.

361 liquor schools have been granted permission in the past. This is a political bribery. These have been made on the recommendation of MPs. It was announced during the election campaign that we would reveal this. But even though all the liquor schools were allowed, they were given in the recommendation of any MPs.

This is a type of political bribery. The High Court has a case regarding how many schools a district should be located. I hope that its verdict will be released in January.

### Social media is also a reason for my failure - Douglas Devananda

Douglas Devananda attributes election loss to social media misinformation. He claims false propaganda spread via social platforms contributed to his defeat. The former fisheries minister accuses a Jaffna businessman of spreading slander, citing unresolved trade issues as motivation.

üü©

Former Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said social media was also the reason for my failure.

We have a setback in this election. It can also be called a temporary rest in politics. When was the minister, there was work on the head. At present it is not.

Thus we examine the reduction within the party. We have taken steps to address the grievances and take steps to bring the people to the policy of the party. We will also hold the party's national conference very soon.

Social websites are responsible for the fall of Douglas and the rise of Anura. They carried out false propaganda against me through social websites.

They do not exacerbate their videos because they do not want to prevent their income because they are using my name.

News can be seen through newspapers, televisions and radio in the past. Currently, with a hand phone, from the sewage to the bedroom to the bedroom, it is easy to watch the videos, so it reaches people.

Comfort Mattress Lanka will construct a 62,000-square-meter factory to make sponge mattress manufacturing on a 30-year renewable lease agreement with HIGP.

It will import raw materials through global supply chain involving South East Asia and China and make the product in Sri Lanka for export.

Firms in the industrial zone will be able to use the container terminal in the Hambantota Port, Chief Executive Wilson Qu said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe container yard we are developing will handle transhipment and strengthen HIP‚Äôs positioning as a gateway port,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe anticipate heightened interest in the industrial park over the coming years, and as Sri Lanka‚Äôs economy stabilises, we foresee industries outside the port taking advantage of HIP‚Äôs strategic location.‚Äù

### Government extends rice importation period

*2024-12-20 09:17:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104365/government-extends-rice-importation-period) ¬∑ `en`

The government has announced its decision to extend the period for rice importation until January 10, 2025, with the final agreement expected to be confirmed at the Cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday (23).

Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa stated yesterday (19) that measures would be taken to extend the rice import period as necessary. Accordingly, a Gazette notification formalizing the extension will be issued on December 24, 2024.

The current authorization for rice imports is set to expire at midnight today (20). Without an extension, any rice stocks imported after this deadline will need to be re-exported, according to Additional Director General of Customs and Customs Media Spokesperson Seevali Arukgoda.

Since the government granted permission for rice importation on December 4, the private sector has imported a total of 35,600 metric tons of rice. Of this, nearly 20,000 metric tons consist of Nadu rice, while 16,000 metric tons comprise Kekulu rice.

### Sri Lanka extends exchange controls devised by central bank till June

*2024-12-20 07:12:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-extends-exchange-controls-devised-by-central-bank-till-june-195357/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs cabinet of ministers have approved and extension of exchange controls in a proposed by the central bank to extend for six months exchange controls which expired on December 19.

The cabinet has approved extending the exchange control regulation for another six months.

The exchange controls have been revised, a post-cabinet statement said without specifying the changes.

The June 2024 regulations were also less tighter than the earlier ones.

Sri Lanka and other central banks which go to the International Monetary Fund regularly impose exchange control on the people due to deep flaws in their operating framework where monetary policy is in fundamental conflict with exchange rate policy.

When the policy conflicts intensify due to open market operations to narrowly target a policy rate, exchange controls are intensified instead of correcting monetary policy.

The Waqf Board‚Äôs role is not just to preserve property but to ensure that these assets are used effectively to benefit the community

In recent times, the removal and appointment of Waqf Board members have become a subject of intense controversy, driven by political pressures that undermine the very essence of the Waqf system. This interference not only dilutes the authority of the Waqf Board but also threatens its role as a pillar of Islamic social welfare. The Waqf, as an institution founded on the principles of Sharia law, is meant to be a self-sustaining force for good, benefiting generations to come. Yet, when political motives enter the picture, the sanctity and independence of the Waqf are compromised, turning it into a mere shadow of its potential.

‚ÄúSystem change‚Äù was the magical slogan coined by the Aragalaya youth, and that slogan turned out to be the magnetic vote puller for Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and his National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) at the Presidential and General Elections respectively. Although in their public campaigns AKD and NPP identified the post-independence political culture of ethnonationalism and its corrupt system of governance as the two crucial areas to be ended or radically reformed through a social revolution there are also other elements under the old system that requires reforms. In respect of the Muslim community, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) of 1951 is one such area that requires urgent reforms.

He was challenged to prove that he had acquired a doctoral degree from Japan as claimed by him. Unable to do so, Asoka Ranwala had no choice other than to tender his resignation to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

On 17 December 2024, Idampitiyegedara Wanigasuriya Mudiyanselage Jagath Wickramaratne was elected as Speaker. The election was unanimous. Dr. Jagath Wickramarathe who was elected on the NPP ticket from Polonnaruwa district is a medical doctor.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka will review the role of 115 state entities which cost 140 billion rupees a year to maintain, Cabinet Spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.

Sri Lanka now has 86 departments, 25 district secretariats, and 339 divisional secretariats; 340 enterprises owned by the government and 115 non-commercial state statutory institutions other than police.

‚ÄúThere are boards, commissions, foundations, universities and statutory entities,‚Äù Jayatissa said.

‚ÄúIn the 2024 budget, 140 billion rupees was allocated for these entities.‚Äù

The 115 non-commercial state statutory institutions come under the supervision of the Department of National Budget and 51 institutions under the Department of Public Enterprises.

The purpose of these establishments has decreased over time, or the entities have lost its timeliness, and they lack or have very little power to initiate programs, and sometimes overlap with other establishments, Jayatissa said.

Following is the full text of the special statement made by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament on Wednesday

Yesterday, we engaged in a robust three-hour debate on debt restructuring. That discussion provided an opportunity to outline the roadmap that has led us to the current stage and to highlight the achievements we have made thus far. I will not delve into lengthy explanations, but I must address a narrative being propagated, a narrative that seeks to instil fear by suggesting that Sri Lanka may face bankruptcy again in 2028. Let me state firmly: under our leadership, we will never allow a situation like 2022-23 to reoccur in our country. In 2028, this Government will still be in power, and we will have achieved stability and resilience.

We are confident in our goal of increasing Sri Lanka‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves to USD 15.1 billion by 2028. This is not just an aspiration; it is a commitment that we are diligently working to fulfil.

### Beyond qualifications: Essence of leadership

By balancing qualifications with real-world exposure and diverse experiences, organisations can promote a culture where innovation flourishes and resilience thrives

In a world where academic achievements often overshadow other dimensions of human potential, the belief that qualifications alone define effective leadership is a widespread misconception. While degrees and certifications can indicate intellectual capability, they fail to capture the true essence of leadership. Authentic leadership transcends formal education; it is a complex interplay of emotional intelligence, empathy, vision, and the ability to inspire action. These attributes are cultivated through experience, exposure, self-awareness, and an innate understanding of human behaviour and societal dynamics.

### Politics aside: 5 critical steps to safeguard Sri Lanka‚Äôs hard-won gains in 2025

*2024-12-20 05:39:39* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Politics-aside-5-critical-steps-to-safeguard-Sri-Lanka-s-hard-won-gains-in-2025/4-770751) ¬∑ `en`

This week, social media was abuzz with controversy surrounding the qualifications of certain politicians within the ruling party and Opposition. The Opposition emphasised the importance of transparency and honesty in leadership, arguing that openly sharing qualifications is essential for maintaining public trust and accountability. They assert that this underscores a core principle of democratic governance: honesty as the foundation of public trust as highlighted by the NPP.

However, less than a month after the last General Election, this very principle seems to have backfired on the NPP, following the Speaker‚Äôs debacle. It is worth noting that educational qualifications are not a requirement to serve as a Member of Parliament in Sri Lanka. The eligibility criteria are limited to citizenship and being over 18 years of age.

Q: Explain the change to be introduced to the personal income tax structure and the impact.

Overall, irrespective of the quantum of the salary of the person everyone will experience a reduction in the taxes paid. Since the personal relief (tax free threshold) has increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000 per month, up to 150,000 per month salary there will not be any income tax payable. Any one receiving salary over Rs. 400,000 per month will experience a tax saving of Rs. 20,500 per month.

### Concerns over neglect of small hydropower plant owners

*2024-12-20 05:34:45* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Concerns-over-neglect-of-small-hydropower-plant-owners/14-770749) ¬∑ `en`

It appears that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has shown minimal consideration towards small hydropower plant owners. Despite paying premium rates per unit of electricity generated by other categories of private power producers, the payments made to mini-hydro power plants remain disproportionately low. This discrepancy is a cause for concern.

While an acceptable rate is paid during the first 15 years or so of operation, subsequent payments drastically reduce to negligible amounts. This is particularly troubling given that small hydropower turbines and generators are often designed for lifespans exceeding 75 years. The rationale for reducing payments after just 15 or 20 years in some instances is difficult to justify.

The disparity is glaring when compared to the payments made to diesel and wind power plants, which continue to receive substantial financial support. The failure to extend similar terms to small hydropower plants is both regrettable and inequitable.

### Petition filed against Minister Upali Pannilage over MP eligibility

*2024-12-20 05:26:48* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Petition-filed-against-Minister-Upali-Pannilage-over-MP-eligibility/56-770741) ¬∑ `en`

A writ petition has been filed before the Court of Appeal seeking a declaration that the Rural Development, Social Security, and Community Empowerment Minister Prof. Upali Pannilage is disqualified from serving as a Member of Parliament and is therefore ineligible to hold office as an MP.

The petition, filed by social and political activist Oshala Herath, alleges that Prof. Pannilage was employed by the University of Ruhuna, a public corporation, at the time of his appointment as an MP and subsequently as a Cabinet Minister. The petitioner contends that this contravenes the provisions of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Constitution, which disqualifies individuals with interests in public contracts from being elected to Parliament.

The respondents in the petition include Minister Prof. Pannilage as the first respondent, Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Anusha Rohanadeera, Vice Chancellor of the University of Ruhuna Prof. Sujeewa Amarasena, the University of Ruhuna, and the Attorney General.
