    "The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) has issued a statement on behalf of the construction industry in Sri Lanka, expressing its congratulations to the newly established President, Prime Minister and other Cabinet members, who have won an overwhelming majority in the Parliamentary elections.",
    "In the statement, Ceylon Institute of Builders President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne further stated: The construction industry is one of the largest industries in Sri Lanka. It employs 1 million direct employees and 1.6 million indirect employees. The construction industry has a turnover of nearly 1 trillion rupees and has contributed 9.6% to the GDP in the past. If the Government supports exports from this industry sector, it could earn about 2 billion dollars in foreign exchange.",
    "Every rupee in this industry is distributed to the lowest levels of society, including workers and other employees. The CIOB has already submitted our Road Map for 2025 and the proposal to revive the construction industry to the NPP.",
    "Therefore, we hope that the new Government will pay special attention to this industry."
