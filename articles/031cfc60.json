    "The parties in contest are highly unlikely to get the required majority of votes due to the \u2018societal polarisation\u2019 that we witness today",
    "Everybody is enthusiastic about the forthcoming elections in Sri Lanka, almost forgetting the priorities of the ongoing economic crisis, sustainability of businesses and livelihood of people. However, generally, people think that electing a new government may resolve all problems in order to achieve their aspirations. This article attempts to evaluate the risks in the contexts of \u2018holding elections\u2019, \u2018continuing the present government at least for a brief period \u2013 allowing the economy to stabilise\u2019 and the implications in the perspective of risk management.",
    "The parties in contest are highly unlikely to get the required majority of votes due to the \u2018societal polarisation\u2019 that we witness today. Societal polarisation is the third-most severe risk in the short term, among the top 10 risks outlined by the WEF (World Economic Forum) Global Risk Report 2024. All major parties may eventually be ended up with less than 50%, due to the polarisation in thinking and the misinformation and disinformation heighten the confusion in the mindset of the voters.",
    "Classification of Risk: Likelihood \u2013 High | Magnitude \u2013 High",
    "In addition to the polarisation, the \u2018experience of voters\u2019 as opposed to the promises made in elections during the past 10 years has fortified a huge \u2018negative cognitive dissonance\u2019 in the mindset. Both factors can hinder the expectation for a \u2018majority\u2019.",
    "This situation might place the country at a risk of delays in deciding on an elected leader/government for a brief period, which may have unexpected conflicts for power and even lead to a \u2018political unrest\u2019, similar to 2022, causing a \u2018reputational risk\u2019. The interest groups may capitalise this \u2018opportunity of instability\u2019 to achieve their goals at any cost. The \u2018human and financial capital\u2019 and \u2018businesses\u2019 may again \u2018start\u2019 deserting the country due to uncertainty.",
    "Scenario 1 may lead to a situation where the leaders may be compelled to consider the option of a coalition government, in order to secure the short-term stability. This may hinder the economic recovery of the country and conflicts on contrasting political interests would directly jeopardise the stability of the legislature and the executive.",
    "Classification of Risk: Likelihood \u2013 High | Magnitude \u2013 High",
    "Risk treatment: Terminate (the activity generating the risk) and/or Treat (the risk in order to reduce the magnitude/likelihood of impact). Here, one has to consciously apply both options to the respective elements of the risk to mitigate the impact.",
    "This is constructed on a \u2018possible\u2019 outcome of the \u2018current trend\u2019 of the polarisation towards a party, which has not yet governed as the ruling party of the country. Case example: If this party, gets a majority of 50.25% (High possibility and remote probability), which is sufficient for a legitimate ruling, then there is a greater probability of misusing/abusing that power by a fractional group, who follows the similar political philosophy, which also has a reputation for violence and coercion. Fractions may employ the kind of \u2018violent tactics\u2019, to \u2018seize that power\u2019 (Case example: social unrest in 2022), to establish controls in their \u2018localities\u2019, which may cause disturbance to peace. These fractions may leverage the \u2018animosity\u2019 created amongst the \u2018Haves\u2019 and \u201cHaves-not\u2019 via the \u2018misinformation and disinformation\u2019 in social media by various political propaganda (e.g. \u2018transferring judicial powers to people in respective localities\u2019 \u2013 an intention declared in public by a politburo member).",
    "The elected party may take time to bring such a situation under control, considering their current level of control on these group/s. This may lead to an \u2018instability\u2019 in governing as the elected party may be compelled to defend their \u2018hard-gain of ruling power\u2019 as an immediate priority from any foreseeable threats. Further, this situation becomes an opportunity to the fractions who have been clamouring for \u2018decentralisation of strategic power\u2019, showcasing the inability of the controlling affairs of the country by the elected Government.",
    "Classification of Risk: Likelihood \u2013 low to medium (depends upon the trends) | Magnitude \u2013 High",
    "Risk treatment: Terminate (the activity generating the risk) and/or Treat (the risk in order to reduce the magnitude/likelihood of impact).",
    "The adaptability of the \u2018risk treatment\u2019 is important than rigid controls. However, vigilant monitoring can assist in assessing the likelihood and magnitude of identified/emerging risks, which may evolve with the \u2018trends in the pre-election period\u2019. However, the authorities should place appropriate measures to mitigate any impact to the country, in this special context, by provisioning for such eventualities.",
    "We must also remember that no democracy has survived without political stability. Moreover, the economic stability stems from the policy stability, depending on the \u2018political stability\u2019.",
