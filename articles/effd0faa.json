    "Americans like to think of themselves as a young country, and a young people. They like to think they represent the New World. In Daisy Miller, the great Henry James contrasts the insouciance of this new world with staidness of the old. The new world does not, to be sure, always triumph \u2013 the heroine in Daisy Miller, for instance, meets a tragic ending \u2013 yet even in tragedy, one feels that it has been vindicated over the old.",
    "America is Daisy Miller: everyone wants to court her, but after a while, everyone wants to be done with her. This is the first myth of the world\u2019s (supposedly) youngest democracy: that it brims with innocence. We all want to see it, but after some point, grow tired of it. Charles Dickens, who visited the country in 1842, grew disillusioned with the people. \u201cHe began,\u201d notes one of his biographers, \u201cto find them overbearing, boastful, vulgar, uncivil, insensitive, and above all acquisitive.\u201d When Dickens returned to England, he wrote Martin Chuzzlewit, which presented a highly unflattering view of Americans.",
    "This leads one to the second of America\u2019s founding myths: that it is a land of opportunity. When you switch on the television, you almost always get bombarded by advertisements targeting the most seemingly inconsequential wants, wishes, desires, and dreams, from window fittings to dark circles. This is because Americans are quick to spot out what people want, and they are quick to find a solution, patchwork or otherwise. They are the ultimate salesmen. What Dickens found distasteful about this \u2013 the \u201cuncivil, insensitive, and above all acquisitive\u201d character of its people \u2013 is what has kept the country going for the last 250 years. Yet in this gold rush for opportunity, some make it, others get left behind. Equality of opportunity, after all, does not always ensure equality of outcome.",
    "That underlies the third founding myth of America: of it being a nation of immigrants. The country was itself founded on immigration, or more correctly, settler-immigration: what Susan Sontag called \u201cthe unquestioned assumption of the right of White people\u201d to come and take over the land of those who lived before them. The anthropologist Eric Wolf, in his masterly study Europe and the People without History, explains how the settlers saw indigenous people and how the latter responded to them. Some were ready to mingle with the white people, even live alongside them. Others were not.",
    "I am not the first person to say that what happened to these people was genocide, and I won\u2019t be the last. Many Americans accept it as such as well: some even admit that white settlers provided a template for Hitler\u2019s final solution. This candidness is a virtue: it is what makes it possible for commentators like Ta-Nehisi Coates to court the liberal mainstream (\u201cMy President Was Black\u201d, a tribute to Obama) and to write a book (The Message, partly about Palestine) that reflects critically on it. What with the war in the Middle East and Gaza in particular, such candidness is (thankfully) becoming more prevalent.",
    "In America, the media, the so-called \u201clamestream-mainstream\u201d as well as the conservative fringe, plays a major role in shaping public consciousness. Right-wing commentators tend to distance themselves from liberal outfits, but the reality is that the two share a lot with each other. Both have certain specific ideological affinities, and both \u2013 sometimes inadvertently, sometimes not \u2013 see the world through the lens of those affinities. Thus, the right-wing media brands Kamala Harris as a dangerous radical, an appeaser of countries hostile to America, while the liberal media questions Donald Trump\u2019s patriotic credentials. Liberal or conservative, the media perpetuates stereotypes about the country\u2019s representatives: thus, Harris is a left-wing Marxist, while Trump is an out-and-out fascist.",
    "Everyone wants to migrate to America, and everyone wants to live there. Few among them make it, but many of those who do see themselves as part of a new body politic. \u201cAmerican\u201d thus becomes more than an adjective: it becomes an abstract noun, which distinguishes you from every other term in the English language. \u201cI\u2019m not a Communist,\u201d Humphrey Bogart declared at the height of the anti-communist witch-hunts of the 1950s. \u201cI\u2019m an American.\u201d From this follows a wide array of interesting terms: we not only have \u201cAmerican food\u201d, a mishmash of different cuisines, and \u201cAmerican English\u201d, a travesty, but \u201cAmerican interests\u201d, \u201cAmerican values\u201d, and most cryptic of all, \u201cthe American way.\u201d",
    "But perhaps I am making a mistake here. Perhaps I am wrong in identifying the United States with America. America is a continent, not a country: it is Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and many others. The United States is not America, just as India is not South Asia. Yet for better or worse, the US has come to define the American continent, just as India has come to dominate the Indian Ocean. This has given it a sense of security that encourages it to think of itself as immune from what happens to the rest of the world. When it sneezes, predictably, the rest of the continent catches a cold. Pierre Trudeau put it best: \u201cLiving next to you,\u201d he once said, \u201cis in some ways like sleeping with an elephant.\u201d",
    "US politicians, on the left and right, refer to the \u201caverage American.\u201d This may be the biggest myth of them all. \u201cThere is no average American,\u201d a friend of mine told me in Seattle. \u201cIt is a lie.\u201d When I hemmed and hawed \u2013 clearly, I should have known better than to assume I knew about Americans more than Americans \u2013 and started talking about average  middle-class Americans, he cut me. \u201cThere is no average middle-class here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no average anything, period.\u201d I then pointed out that both this year\u2019s presidential candidates invoke the term. \u201cOf course they do,\u201d my friend smirked.",
    "The most diplomatic and charitable thing one could say about the US is that it is a paradox. Back home we are fed images of what America is supposed to be: cowboys and Indians, blacks and whites, burgers and French fries. Yet once one has lived long enough here, one tends to question these stereotypes, and ask what America really is and what it represents. Of course, one may never find answers to these questions.",
    "Perhaps these questions cannot be answered. Perhaps it\u2019s futile to search for answers in the first place. America is an irony: a country built by settlers that thrives on immigration, a country where everyone can try everything, but very few make it till the end \u2013 a country that imposes rules on the rest of us \u2013 yet has the power to bend them on its own.",
