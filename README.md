The recent VAT revisions have hit the poorest the hardest, whereas the bottom 10% of income group households now spend about 10% of their income on VAT

The VAT burden has risen by approximately 50%, primarily due to the removal of VAT exemptions on around 100 items

Earlier this year, Sri Lanka introduced major changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The VAT rate increased from 15% to 18%, and tax exemptions were removed for 97 items, including essential goods such as gas and stationery.

At a conference in the mid ‚Äô90s, Dr. Harvey Forest, solar visionary and President of Solarex (then one of the largest solar companies), displayed a slide titled ‚ÄúSolar Heaven‚Äù. He predicted that annual solar installations would reach 1 Gigawatt (GW) or 1,000 Megawatt (MW) in a few years, which he called ‚Äúsolar heaven‚Äù. He said that at this capacity, investment into the highly capital-intensive silicon manufacturing becomes viable and this would free solar from its dependence on the semiconductor industry, for its main raw material, silicon. This in turn would drive down cost, spurring demand and setting off a virtuous cycle of more investment, more capacity, lower costs and more demand and completely transform the fledgling industry into global scale.

### Doing it unplugged

The LunuDehi-Bathiya and Santhush (BNS) combination has been creating a storm with their music, especially overseas.

Of course, their music is very infectious here, too, but the demand for them overseas is stupendous‚Ä¶and they do it differently, as well.

Their unplugged concerts are crowd-pullers where they perform using all acoustic instruments ‚Äì guitars, piano, brass instruments, violins, cajons, etc.

In fact, their next overseas unplugged concert will be in Australia.

BNS will be doing ‚ÄòHadagasma‚Äô, a special edition Unplugged Concert at Palms at Crown, in Melbourne, on Sunday, 27th October, with LunuDehi providing the backing, using acoustic instruments.

The organisers are expecting a full house and it‚Äôs very likely that would happen as 70% of the tickets have already been purchased by fans of BNS/LuniDehi.

The recent VAT revisions have hit the poorest the hardest, whereas the bottom 10% of income group households now spend about 10% of their income on VAT.

The VAT burden has risen by approximately 50%, primarily due to theremoval of VAT exemptions on around 100 items.

This blog offers potential solutions for easing the VAT burden in Sri Lanka.

### Profit-takings among banking sector counters send bourse into bearish disposition

The stock market indicated a bearish trend yesterday because profit- takings were noted among banking sector counters. However, other counters did fairly well, market analysts said.

Further, plantation sector counters apparently performed well during the day, probably due to a tea price hike in the global market caused by dry weather conditions prevailing in India, which is one of the largest tea producers in the world.

Further, apparel sector stocks also performed well due to healthy exports in the sector, compared to last year.

Apart from that, the JKH share price also moved up due to the opening of its flagship, ‚ÄúCinnamon Life‚Äù project today.

While the recent Presidential elections in Sri Lanka have set a positive tone for the country‚Äôs economic and political landscape, there is still significant work to be done to build on this momentum. The Government‚Äôs initial focus on anti-corruption, transparency, and institutional reforms has already had a strong impact on market confidence and investor sentiment. However, in the current global economic climate, additional measures are necessary to ensure that these early gains translate into long-term prosperity.

Conditioned to internalise information mechanically, students are moulded into conformity and rote memorisation, influenced more by parental expectations and societal pressures than by their talents and aspirations

The entrenched education system excels at producing highly skilled and committed engineers, doctors, mathematicians, and IT professionals, yet it often fails to prepare them to address the oppression and injustices encountered when applying their education in their professions. These professionals may be blind to, or unwilling to acknowledge, these issues. Evidence abounds that educated, talented, and well-travelled individuals‚Äîthose leading cosmopolitan lives‚Äîfrequently perpetuate disparities and inequities. They swiftly blame extremists and politicians when things go awry and comfortably evade accountability by positioning themselves as mere producers of ideas, conveniently leaving implementation to others

Both Thailand and Sri Lanka boast of numerous tourist attractions that are essentially places of religious worship.

India did not go into detail on the investigation, but relations have been fraught since 2023, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had evidence linking Indian agents to the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader on his territory.

India has long denied Trudeau‚Äôs accusation. On Monday it dismissed Canada‚Äôs move on the inquiry and accused Trudeau of pursuing a ‚Äúpolitical agenda‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe have no faith in the current Canadian Government‚Äôs commitment to ensure their security.

Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials,‚Äù India‚Äôs foreign ministry said in a statement.

It later said it had asked the six Canadian diplomats to leave by Saturday.
