The only certainty is that it will be one of three candidates—incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa or NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The other 35 candidates including the young scion of the Rajapaksa family and candidate of the SLPP are at best “also-rans.” But even they are hopeful. There appears to be a substantial number of voters who are undecided, and their hope is that those votes will come their way. Indeed, the principle of the “echo chamber” is working to the fullest extent at this election.

The objective of the debt standstill was to create some space for Sri Lanka to commence negotiations for restructuring debt in a manner that would enable debt service to resume in the future

The Finance Ministry in a statement said it has observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilisation in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return. It is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialise and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilisation. In this context the Finance Ministry via this statement addresses some of these misperceptions and explains the correct position in this regard to the public.

Is it correct that Sri Lanka does not service any of its foreign debt following the announcement of the debt standstill in April 2022?

### Lasting legacy of a unique politician – M. D. Banda

*2024-09-16 23:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lasting-legacy-of-a-unique-politician-m-d-banda/) · `en`

Fifty years is a long time, enough for most things to fade into obscurity. So, it is truly remarkable that the legacy of the late Mr. M.D. Banda continues to endure, even five decades after his passing on September 18, 1974. In a country where memories are often short-lived, the fact that M.D. Banda’s name is still spoken with respect and admiration is indeed a testament to the profound impact he made on Sri Lanka.

What makes this all the more intriguing is that M.D. Banda was a rare politician, one who actively avoided the limelight and personal glorification. He never put his name on plaques or buildings, nor sought to be immortalized in monuments, despite spearheading countless development projects for the people. His greatness lies not in self-promotion, but in his remarkable deeds.

### Mega scene with Gypsies …Down Under

*2024-09-16 23:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/mega-scene-with-gypsies-down-under/) · `en`

The Gypsies is one band that has the ability, and the talent, to cater to the musical tastes of a wide and varied audience and they proved it in a mega way during their recent tour of Australia, taking in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide.

Surprisingly, Melbourne wasn’t included, and that’s a happening place where Sri Lankans are concerned, but leader Piyal Perera has a valid explanation.

“We didn’t take in Melbourne because we were there in February, this year, and we generally like to keep a gap of about one year before we return.”

The concerts in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide were well patronised – in fact, it was ‘sold out’ at all three venues.

On social media, this came up regarding the band’s concert in Perth:

“Sold Out! The Gypsies are ready to bring the house down in Perth on 31st August at the Indian Community Hall! Get ready for an unforgettable night of music and dance. Thank you to all our fans for your incredible support!”

### Doing it in Germany

*2024-09-16 22:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/doing-it-in-germany/) · `en`

Kevin Elias has been a musician for many years now, but, I guess, not many music lovers in the scene here would remember Kevin as he left for Switzerland in 1988.

He is now based in Germany and is quite active in the scene there … as a solo artiste, also as a duo and trio, depending on the occasion.

Right now he is doing the duo scene with former Moonstones’ guitarist Anura Herat.

In the past, he had a four-piece band, but the pandemic changed everything.

Hotels and entertainment venues made drastic cuts, where payments to musicians were concerned, with most venues opting for duos, said Kevin, adding that quite a few nightspots, in Germany, have also put up shutters.

“I’m lucky I have work at hotels, and I also perform on a cruise ship, singing German, Spanish, Italian and English songs. I do a show – let’s say a very entertaining performance!”

In Sri Lanka, Kevin performed with several bands, including Super Pink & Purple and Climax, and had his own band, as well – Zodiac.

### How will 1.65 million Muslims vote on Saturday?

*2024-09-16 22:37:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-will-1-65-million-Muslims-vote-on-Saturday/4-766764) · `en`

90% of the Muslim voters do not want to live under fears of racial riots

Statistically Muslims constitute only 9.3% of the national population. They are a close second to the Sri Lankan Tamil strength of 11.1% according to the 2012 Census. The statistical difference is only 1.8% unlike the figures before the July 1983 racial riots. The anti-Tamil pogrom led to Tamils emigrating from the island in noticeably large numbers. It must be added that Tamil migration increased the statistical percentages of both Sinhala and Muslim population in the country but not their real numbers.

In terms of the real number who are likely to go to polls placed at 75%, the number of votes cast by the Muslims would be around 1.2 million and Tamil votes around 1.4 million. The difference in the number of voters would be only around point 2 million or 200,000! The Upcountry Tamils, the third largest minority, who vote invariably independent of the Sri Lankan Tamils constitute 4.1% of the national population.
