    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s spending on the new welfare benefit scheme to address poverty is likely to go up with more than 188,000 people having appealed against them being rejected and State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said the cabinet may likely consider more funds.",
    "The island nation has earmarked 208 billion rupees to the new \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 welfare scheme and the officials told last week that out of 3.7 million applicants, 3.3 million are screened and the list is declared public for appeals and protests.",
    "Semasinghe said the government has so far got 188,794 appeals and 3,304 protests after the names were declared last week.",
    "\u201cThe total cost was estimated based on an assumption that 30 percent of the poverty beneficiaries were ineligible to receive money. If there is a significant change in the amount, there are some funds to manage that,\u201d Semasinghe told reporters in Colombo at a media briefing held on Tuesday (27).",
    "\u201cWe can only confirm the number of beneficiaries only after assessing the appeals and protests.",
    "The island nation has seen increasing protests from trade unions affiliated to the government since last week held by potential welfare beneficiaries against alleged injustice in the evaluation process. The government has provisionally eliminated 400,000 applicants after initial assessments.",
    "A number of opposition legislators last week criticised the government over the matter.",
    "On May 12, Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament approved a new welfare benefit plan which would consolidate existing social welfare schemes and allow beneficiaries to enter and exit depending on changing incomes. The proposal was approved by the parliament without a vote.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s poor has surged by 4 million to 7 million since 2019 to 31 percent of the population in 2023, a recent survey by LIRNEasia showed.",
    "The new scheme with targeting subsidies is one of the key conditions by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to release funds, government officials have told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cThere could be a lot of shortcomings. But we are ready to correct ourselves and take the appropriate decision in a transparent manner,\u201d Semesinghe\u00a0said.",
    "The scheme targets the real needy people through 22 indicators and is expected to\u00a0 be implemented from July this year. (Colombo/June 27/2023)"
