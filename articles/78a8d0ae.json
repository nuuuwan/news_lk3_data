    "Ambassador/Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the WTO in Geneva R.G.S Wijesekara (left) handing over the Protocol of Acceptance to WTO Director General Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala",
    "The Government of Sri Lanka has formally deposited its instrument of acceptance of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, becoming one of the latest WTO members to take this important step towards protecting global marine resources. With this ratification, only four more acceptances are needed for the agreement to enter into force.",
    "This ratification reflects Sri Lanka\u2019s steadfast commitment to sustainable ocean governance and responsible fisheries management, consistent with national policies articulated under the \u201cThriving Nation and a Beautiful Life\u201d framework. The Agreement prohibits subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and to the exploitation of overfished stocks \u2014 both critical concerns for coastal and island nations such as Sri Lanka.",
    "Fisheries remain a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s food security, export economy, and coastal livelihoods. By aligning national legislation, with global disciplines, Sri Lanka is strengthening its capacity to sustainably manage marine resources while enhancing its credibility in key international markets.",
    "This step also supports Sri Lanka\u2019s broader blue economy agenda and builds on recent international commitments, including signing into the UN Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). The ratification enables Sri Lanka to access technical and financial assistance through the WTO Fisheries Fund, which supports developing countries in implementing sustainable fisheries practices.",
    "The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, adopted by consensus at the WTO\u2019s 12th Ministerial Conference in 2022, is the first WTO agreement with an explicit environmental sustainability focus. It is also a significant contribution toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 14.6, which calls for the elimination of harmful fisheries subsidies.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s ratification underscores its leadership in global ocean stewardship and its readiness to engage in cooperative efforts to ensure the sustainability of marine ecosystems for current and future generations."
