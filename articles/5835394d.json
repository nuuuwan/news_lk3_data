  "original_body_lines": [
    "S&P Global Ratings on Friday raised its long- and short-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings on Sri Lanka to \u2018CCC+/C\u2019 from \u2018SD/SD\u2019 (selective default).",
    "\u201cWe also affirmed our \u2018CCC+/C\u2019 long- and short-term local currency ratings. The outlook on both the long-term foreign and local currency ratings is stable. The transfer and convertibility assessment remains \u2018CCC+\u2019,\u201d the leading American credit rating agency said.",
    "S&P Global Ratings said the stable outlook reflects \u201ca balance between our expectation of Sri Lanka\u2019s continued economic recovery, supported by fiscal reform and external improvements, and the country\u2019s high debt and heavy interest burden over the next one to two years.\u201d",
    "However, the rating agency said it could lower the ratings on Sri Lanka \u201cif we see indications of renewed funding and liquidity stresses.\u201d",
    "Developments that could precede such signs include a rapid rise in inflation, a further rise in the government\u2019s interest burden, or significantly weaker fiscal performance, leading to funding pressures, the statement said.",
    "\u201cWe could raise the ratings if economic growth continues to be robust and we believe that Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal and external improvements are more entrenched. This would improve the government\u2019s ability to manage its large debt.\u201d",
    "S&P Global Ratings added that the upgrade reflects Sri Lanka\u2019s recent efforts to complete the restructuring of its remaining commercial debt, including government-guaranteed SriLankan Airlines (SLA) bonds, following its December 2024 exchange of most of its Eurobonds.",
    "Negotiations on restructuring the SLA debt began earlier this year, with the airline and government making an offer based on comparability of treatment with other external creditors.",
    "\u201cWe see a possibility that some lenders could become holdout creditors, making a further resolution in the negotiations unlikely, based on the passage of time.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe believe this situation is also unlikely to disrupt or unwind the debt restructuring process, given the principles of comparability of treatment and the most-favored creditor clauses in Sri Lanka\u2019s restructured bonds.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe ratings on Sri Lanka are supported by its strong economic recovery, rapid fiscal consolidation and reform (supported by an ongoing IMF program), accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, an improving external position, and sustained progress in reducing fiscal risks from its state-owned enterprises (SOE).\u201d",
    "\u201cThese strengths are counterbalanced by the country\u2019s high debt--as most of its high-yielding domestic commercial debt was excluded from the debt restructuring exercise--and a very heavy interest burden of about 50% of general government revenue. These structural vulnerabilities will take time to unwind, particularly as external debt servicing will start to increase in 2029.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe \u2018CCC+\u2019 ratings reflect our views that Sri Lanka\u2019s creditworthiness is vulnerable and dependent upon favorable financial and economic conditions, but the government does not face a near-term payment crisis.\u201d"
