    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The cabinet of ministers of Sri Lanka\u2019s transition minority government has approved diesel and kerosene subsidies for the fisheries sector ahead of the general election in a month.",
    "The proposal to provide 25 rupees per litre of diesel upto a 300,000 litres a month, and 25 rupees per litre of kerosene upto 15 litres a day and 25 days a month, Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters.",
    "The fuel subsidy was first proposed by the previous government, but halted by the election commission due to the presidential election, as it would unfairly sway voters.",
    "But the Election Commission had approved this proposal Herath said.",
    "Sri Lanka revised its fuel prices down on the 1st of this month as per its monthly pricing formula.",
    "Whenever price revisions are made for diesel and kerosene, the maximum concession price for diesel would be 250 rupees and for kerosene 150 rupees, subject to a maximum six month period, Herath said.",
    "The fuel subsidy scheme will be maintained in such a way that the fishing communities receive the concession of 7.5% from the market value for diesel and 12.5% from the market value for kerosene, he said.",
    "Herath did not answer a previous question on what steps the government has taken to ensure buffer stocks and price stability in case of a rise in global oil prices amidst Israel\u2019s escalating war efforts in the oil producing middle east. (Colombo/Oct15/2024)"
