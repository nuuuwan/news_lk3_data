    "In conveying the message of Islam to the society of his era, Prophet Muhammad faced numerous challenges. However, his greatest strengths were his patience and forbearance. Rather than accepting a fractured and divided Arab society, he devoted twenty-three years of his life through his teachings, actions, sacrifices and exemplary lifestyle to foster a community inspired by the core principles of Islam: one that embraced the principles of brotherhood, peace and compassion.",
    "The doctrine of his teachings was the profound principle of equality that no person is superior or inferior to another on the basis of race, caste, or colour. His commitment to abolishing social divides and instilling equality in the hearts of humanity stands as a timeless guide as we work today to create a lawful, ethical and virtuous society amidst contemporary social challenges.",
    "As we strive to elevate our nation to a greater level through a new paradigm based on compassion and love, I invite all of you who are part of this journey with us to enhance this year\u2019s celebration of Milad-un-Nabi by adhering to the principles espoused by the Holy Prophet Muhammad.",
    "May all Sri Lankan Muslims and the Muslim brethren around the world be blessed with a meaningful Milad-un-Nabi!\u201d"
