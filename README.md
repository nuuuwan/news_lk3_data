### Sri Lanka revealed as most popular solo travel destination for 2025

*2024-11-22 11:58:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103686/sri-lanka-revealed-as-most-popular-solo-travel-destination-for-2025) · `en`

Solo travellers are getting older and are increasingly drawn to Asian destinations – with Sri Lanka securing the most popular spot for 2025, says new data from Flash Pack.

Flash Pack’s latest trends report reveals Sri Lanka has claimed the top spot for solo travel in 2025, advancing from fourth place in 2024.

The appeal is clear, says Flash Pack: “Sri Lanka packs in all the punch of India – only on a smaller, more accessible scale, and delivered at a much slower pace.” The company highlights diverse experiences from “incense-swirled cities, buzzing with tuk tuks” to “misty highlands steeped in tea plantations” and dramatic coastlines.

“But where Sri Lanka really comes into its own,” the company adds, “is its easy-going balance of beaches, spoiling hotels and restorative, delicately spiced food.”

The super majority that the president enjoys in parliament may well be the silver bullet a nation that was once more than morally bankrupt needs to extricate itself from its present manifold predicaments – endemic/systemic corruption first and foremost among them… IF the endorsement of a subsequent (almost) 6.9 million voters doesn’t turn his head, or the realities of the realpolitik that may become necessary to run the republic cause the ship of state to founder

A substantial portion of Sri Lankan SMEs, approximately 70%, are currently insolvent or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy

A cornerstone of successful debt recovery lies in preserving the business’s operational viability rather than resorting to liquidation. Many debt restructuring solutions fall short by neglecting the critical aspect of cash flow matching, which is fundamental to servicing debt obligations. By strategically realigning assets based on their utilisation, it is possible to strike a balance between debt recovery and cash generation, fostering a more sustainable recovery process

It appears that FDIs most probably have deliberately avoided investing in SL mainly due to the poor political instability prevailing in the country from about 1956

The path to prosperity of Sri Lanka starts from political stability to enable it to attract mainly FDI as it lacks the capital, skills, technologies and the required international market access to start an export-led strategy of economic development to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty. In this strategy it is important to emphasise on promoting especially the productivity (of the private sector, (which has been described as the ‘the engine of growth’) apart from upgrading the macroeconomic stability of the country and the international market access

I am firmly in the position that the National List of the United People's Power should be resolved quickly.Eran Wickremaratne and Hirunika Premachandra, who worked hard for the party, lost by a small number of votes. We are trying to get them a national list seat.

The president's speech has been mentioned many things. The President noted that the project with the Monetary Fund continues to be carried out. This is what we have been saying from the beginning.

The president does not clearly mention his policy declaration on foreign policy. So this is a bit of a matter of observation. He said the government should reveal what kind of foreign policy it is.

An analysis of Sri Lankan election data highlights a collapse of many Government affiliated parties and reveals why Tamil nationalism might be growing – not shrinking

The 2024 Sri Lankan Parliamentary election concluded last week, in which the ruling National People’s Power (NPP) gained a record majority and made headway into the Tamil homeland. There were notable casualties for senior Tamil nationalist politicians and for the first time ever a southern political party managed to gain a majority in all but one district in the north-east. Commentators have since speculated whether the result spells the beginning of the end for Tamil nationalist politics.

Instead, the figures highlight a range of factors, including the fall of other southern Opposition political parties, leftist coalitions and paramilitary groups that allowed the NPP to siphon votes and grow their base amongst those who had already previously voted for pro-state forces.

🟩

Today is a special day in our Parliament. The authority was handed over to both groups. Our side has empowered the last presidential election. It is important in the history of Sri Lanka.Most MPs have been selected in our country's electoral system. All the provinces and people have contributed to it as the North and East.

Political parties have been formed on the basis of provinces, nationalism and religions for so long. So the separation, doubt and racism were strengthened between people. When racism is strengthened on one side, racism will be strengthened against it. Racism will not be in the same place. We have seen the history of it in our country, politics and society. But we thank all the people who believe in us.

There are people who believe in other parties without trusting us. That is democracy. It is not democratic to create people's activities surrounding a single party.
