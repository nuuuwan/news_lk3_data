  "original_body_lines": [
    "China\u2019s military launched a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying it was a warning to the \u201cseparatist acts of Taiwan independence forces\u201d, drawing condemnation from the Taipei and U.S. governments.",
    "Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, had been on alert for more war games since last week\u2019s national day speech by President Lai Ching-te. Lai\u2019s address was condemned by Beijing after he said China had no right to represent Taiwan even as he offered to cooperate with Beijing.",
    "The Chinese military\u2019s Eastern Theatre Command said the \u201cJoint Sword-2024B\u201d drills were taking place in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan.",
    "\u201cThe drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces. It is a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity,\u201d it said in a statement carried both in Chinese and English. In a parallel move on Monday, Beijing sanctioned a prominent Taiwan tech tycoon Robert Tsao and a lawmaker for separatist activities.",
    "It published a map showing nine areas around Taiwan where the drills were taking place - two on the island\u2019s east coast, three on the west coast, one to the north and three around Taiwan-controlled islands next to the Chinese coast.",
    "Chinese warship formations, destroyers and aircraft are approaching Taiwan in \u201cclose proximity from different directions\u201d, focusing on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, blockading key ports and areas, assaulting maritime and ground targets, the command added.",
    "A military announcement later confirmed that China\u2019s Liaoning aircraft carrier and supporting ships were operating east of Taiwan.",
    "However, it did not announce any live-fire exercises or any no fly areas. In 2022, shortly after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China fired missiles over the island.",
    "In a major move, China\u2019s coast guard circled Taiwan and staged \u201claw enforcement\u201d patrols close to Taiwan\u2019s offshore islands of Matsu and Dongyin, entering the \u201crestricted waters\u201d of Matsu island for the first time to \u201ccompletely tear up\u201d boundaries set by Taiwan authorities, according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
    "CCTV added that China \u201cmay carry out regular law enforcement patrols around Matsu in future.\u201d",
    "Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry and coast guard said both agencies had dispatched their own forces while officials said Lai\u2019s National Security Council met on Monday to discuss the situation.",
    "Taiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te condemned the exercises and said they are \u201cintended to undermine regional peace and stability and continue to coerce neighbouring countries by force.\u201d",
    "National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu said China had ignored Lai\u2019s message of goodwill.",
    "\u201cUsing military force to threaten other countries goes against the basic spirit of the United Nations charter to peacefully resolve disputes,\u201d he told reporters.",
    "Chinese state media said the rocket force carried out simulated missile launches while fighter jets \u201copened up air assault corridors\u201d and bombers carried out long range missions.",
    "In a propaganda video, the Eastern Theatre Command showed a cartoon caricature of Lai with pointed ears like a devil and fighter jets and warships around the island.",
    "A Taiwan security source said there were no signs so far of any missile launches.",
    "Security analysts are watching Chinese operations closely given its broader build-up of missile capabilities and efforts by the U.S. and its allies to improve defences against them.",
    "Taiwan\u2019s China policy making Mainland Affairs Council said China\u2019s latest war games and refusal to renounce the use of force were \u201cblatant provocations\u201d that seriously undermined regional peace and stability.",
    "Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said in a statement that China should face up to the fact of the existence of the Republic of China - Taiwan\u2019s formal name - and respect the people of Taiwan\u2019s choice of a free and democratic way of life.",
    "It should \u201crefrain from military provocations that would disrupt the status quo of peace and stability in the region, and threaten Taiwan\u2019s democratic freedoms,\u201d the statement said.",
    "In Washington, officials from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden said they were monitoring the drills and there was no justification for them after Lai\u2019s \u201croutine\u201d speech.",
    "\u201cWe call on the PRC to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region, which is essential to regional peace and prosperity and a matter of international concern,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, using the initials for the People\u2019s Republic of China, China\u2019s official name.",
    "A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said they believed China was practicing blockading Taiwanese ports to the north and south of the island and international shipping lanes as well as repelling the arrival of foreign forces.",
    "Taiwan\u2019s stock exchange largely brushed off the tensions, with the benchmark index rising 0.3%, and there was no sign of public alarm.",
    "\u201cI am actually worried that there might be accidental fire between the two sides, but I have total confidence in our country and our national army,\u201d said finance worker Ben Lai, 51, watching jets land and take off at the Hsinchu air base.",
    "Taiwan on Sunday had reported a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing to the island\u2019s south through the strategic Bashi Channel which separates Taiwan from the Philippines and connects the South China Sea to the Pacific.",
    "The PLA\u2019s Liberation Army Daily newspaper wrote on Monday that \u201cthose who play with fire get burned!\u201d",
    "\u201cAs long as the \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 provocations continue, the PLA\u2019s actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not stop,\u201d the paper said.",
    "China held the \u201cJoint Sword-2024A\u201d drills for two days around Taiwan in May shortly after Lai took office, saying they were \u201cpunishment\u201d for separatist content in his inauguration speech.",
    "Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan\u2019s people can decide their future and rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims."
