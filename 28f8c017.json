    "The remains of Sri Lankan businessman Onesh Subasinghe, who was murdered in a serviced apartment in Jakarta earlier this year, were brought to Sri Lanka on Tuesday after six months and handed over to his family members, police said.",
    "Subasinghe, 45, was on vacation in Jakarta with his Brazilian wife Rosa, her assistant (also a Brazilian woman), and their 4-year-old daughter.",
    "On February 2, 2023, Subasinghe was found dead under mysterious circumstances in an apartment in Jakarta. Following his death, his wife Rosa and her assistant left the apartment with Onesh's daughter and all their belongings. Surveillance footage showed them putting up a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. It was later reported that Subasinghe's wife and her assistant had fled to Indonesia and then travelled to Doha before finally reaching S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with Onesh's daughter.",
    "Police stated that Subasinghe's body was brought to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Tuesday and taken to the Negombo General Hospital for a post-mortem examination. The body was subsequently handed over to his family members.",
    "It was also reported that Indonesian authorities had also conducted a post-mortem investigation in Indonesia.",
    "Following a complaint from Subasinghe's sister, the Airport Police launched an investigation into his death.",
    "The Inspector General of Police (IGP) had previously instructed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to investigate the possibility that the plot to murder Subasinghe may have been planned in Sri Lanka, even though it was executed in Indonesia.",
    "Consequently, a CID team was sent to Indonesia to probe the murder.",
    "However, authorities are still in the process of unraveling the mystery behind Subasinghe's murder.(DSB)"
