    "Welcoming Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India, Mr. Modi informed that both sides have held talks on a number of infrastructure projects that can ensure greater connectivity between the two countries and announced a development assistance package for the Tamils of Indian origin who are marking 200th anniversary of their arrival into the island nation.",
    "President Wickremesinghe expressed his government\u2019s \u201cprofound appreciation\u201d for the support that India extended to Sri Lanka over the last year which he described as the \u201cmost challenging period in Sri Lanka\u2019s modern history\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe took up the issue of reconstruction and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe presented his inclusive point of view to me. We hope that Sri Lanka\u2019s government will fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people. We expect that Colombo will take forward the process of reconstruction for ensuring equality, justice and peace. We hope that Sri Lanka will fulfil its commitment to implement the 13th Amendment and to hold provincial elections,\u201d said PM Modi delivering his remarks in Hindi.",

    "The 13th Amendment is a three-decade-old Sri Lankan legislation that pledged devolution of power to the nine provinces which is yet to be fulfilled. Two days before the arrival of President Wickremesinghe to India, the issue came to the centre stage after the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) \u201ccategorically rejected\u201d the promise of the present government to implement the amendment sans police powers.

    "The two sides adopted a vision document to enhance maritime, energy and people-to-people connectivity. Mr. Modi announced that a passenger ferry service will be launched soon to connect Tamil Nadu\u2019s Nagapattinam and northern Sri Lanka\u2019s Kankesanthurai. \u201cWe have decided to fast-track the work of connecting the electricity grids of both countries,\u201d announced PM Modi.",
