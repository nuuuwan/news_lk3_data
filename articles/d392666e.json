  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s coconut industry is facing a significant crisis, with production levels plummeting from three billion nuts annually to just 2.85 billion nuts. Erratic policies of previous governments regarding fertilizer use have played a key role in precipitating this situation, Coconut Development Authority (CDA) chairman, Shantha Ranathunga said.",
    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review, Ranathunga highlighted that the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations has led many farmers to neglect best practices in nurturing coconut trees, thus exacerbating the problem.",
    "Ranathunga added: \u2018Additionally, the industry is grappling with various diseases and pest infestations, often a result of insufficient care and oversight. Despite these challenges, the global market is witnessing an unexpected boom for local exporters. A shortage of coconut supplies in the Philippines and Indonesia has created opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters, who are now able to secure better prices for their products.",
    "\u2018In response to the escalating global demand and prices for coconuts, including desiccated coconut, the government has begun implementing measures to facilitate imports of coconut kernel. This decision, which follows requests from major companies like Nestle and CBL, is intended to support the local export market.",
    "\u2018A Cabinet paper is currently being prepared to grant exporters the authority to import any quantity of coconut kernel they require, thereby removing restrictions that have previously hampered supply.",
    "\u2018We have concerns over the influence of a \u201ccoconut mafia,\u201d which has manipulated local prices, resulting in retail costs soaring to Rs. 150-160 for coconuts purchased from estates at Rs. 90-100. To counteract this, we have urged state estates participating in the coconut auction at the CDA to set auction prices at a minimum of Rs. 105, aiming to curb excessive profits made by middlemen.",
    "\u2018Furthermore, the CDA is taking steps to provide financial relief to farmers. A subsidy of Rs. 60,000 to 65,000 per acre\u2014covering approximately 50 trees\u2014will be available, financed from the CDA\u2019s funds. This initiative aims to assist small farmers in acquiring the necessary fertilizers to boost coconut production.",
    "\u2018With local coconut and coconut oil prices rapidly escalating, the urgency to stabilize the domestic market has never been greater. Rising global edible oil prices have compounded these issues, with refined coconut oil prices climbing from USD 1,320 to USD 1,880 per ton, while palm oil prices approach USD 1,250 per ton due to climatic impacts and increased international demand.\u2019",
