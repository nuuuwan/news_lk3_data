    "Biden seems to be synonymous with blundering when it comes to politicos, though he is not in isolation. There does not seem to be a dearth of blundering politicos around the world! The latest to join that lot is the president of South Korea Yoon Suk Yeol. His declaration of martial law on 03 December took not only the South Koreans but also the entire world by surprise. Though South Korea has a troubled past, being ruled by dictators for nearly four decades under martial law on countless occasions, transitioning to a democracy only in 1988, the world has come to regard it as a prosperous democracy. Giants of consumer electronics like Samsung and LG as well as car manufacturers like Hyundai and KIA raised the profile of South Korea which was recently enhanced by the worldwide popularity of K-Pop. In this scenario, President Yoon\u2019s sudden declaration of martial law, on the false premise that the opposition is Communist, has tarnished the reputation of the country. Though the members of parliament circumvented many difficulties to assemble and unanimously oppose his declaration, when it came to his impeachment, members of his party walked out. Politicians are the same, wherever in the world, putting self-interest over that of the country!",
    "Europe seems to be in turmoil. The highest court in Romania has annulled the presidential election result. Germany was plunged into a political crisis in November, after the Chancellor Olaf Scholtz fired his finance minister, who was from a different party of his coalition, accusing him of putting party before the country. Scholtz has caused the government to face a vote of confidence on 16 December, which he is predicted to lose resulting in a fresh election in February. The other driving force in EU, France is in no better shape. President Emanuel Macron\u2019s gamble of a snap election, shortly before the Paris Olympics, did not pay off and his party is now running a minority government. Michel Barnier, whom he appointed as PM in September, attempted to push through his radical budget utilising a legal loophole, resulting in a no-confidence vote. For the first time in over 60 years the French parliament voted down a government! Barnier lasted a little longer than UK\u2019s Liz Truss and will remain as caretaker PM till Macron finds a replacement; no one knows when!",
    "Considering all this turmoil, one would have expected the UK to be stable as the Labour party swept the boards in the July election. However, the reality is just the opposite. A disastrous budget has thrown into question economic prosperity, private sector shying away from investment not only due to adverse budgetary proposals but also because of strengthening of trade union rights with no reciprocations from the unions. On 29 November, Louise Haigh, the Secretary of State for Transport, resigned when it was reported in the press that she had pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation relating to misleading the police in 2014. In 2013, she had reported to the police that on a night out, she was mugged and lost the mobile phone provided by her then employer, insurance giant Aviva. Aviva provided her with a better phone. She found the old phone and started using it without informing the police. It is alleged that the mugging incident was a ruse to get a better mobile! When police interviewed her, she opted for \u201cno comment\u201d on legal advice and when she was charged, she pleaded guilty, also on legal advice! She resigned from Aviva and entered parliament in 2015 and held many shadow ministerial posts before taking the transport portfolio of the Labour government. Though she maintains that the PM was aware of her spent conviction, at the time she was appointed to the Cabinet, PM\u2019s office has stated that she had not made a full disclosure. There are rumours that she was \u2018eased-off\u2019 as she belongs to the Left of the party, having previously been a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn!",
    "Probably, sensing the lack of success of his government, on 05 December, Keir Starmer had a relaunch in Pinewood studios, famous for filming Carry-On films and some Bond movies, where he presented seven pillars, six milestones, five missions and three foundations on which he wanted the voters to judge him at the end of term. His joke that he may be a James Bond fell flat and some journalists have branded this as a \u2018parade of buzzwords\u2019!",
    "Returning to Biden, his dementia seems to be getting worse as he seems to have forgotten what he said just two months ago, that he would not barter his principles even if it means that his son would end up in jail! His reversal is all the more surprising because his pardon extends much further than granting clemency to Hunter Biden\u2019s federal tax and gun convictions, being a blanket grant of immunity for any federal offences he may have committed between 01 January 2014 to 01 December 2024. It is interesting that this period covers the period when Biden Hunter was a director of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and had deals with China, which Trump wanted probed.",
    "The new dawn in Sri Lanka also seems to be getting further away as the new government seems to be increasingly realising that it is easier to be in opposition! It is interesting that there is no uproar though the price of a coconut is now based on half a coconut! Like previous governments, accusations are made of rice mafias but, in spite of the massive mandate, no action seems to be taken except an NPP MP alleging that one of them is in the national list of an opposition party! The government is just following the predecessors by deciding to import rice. President, it is reported, has fixed the price of various varieties of rice and it would be interesting to see what happens.",
    "The vociferous former election chief has challenged the Speaker of the Parliament to produce proof of his doctorate. Do hope he will do so, in the spirit of the promised transparency!",
    "PTA, which was much maligned by the NPP whilst in opposition, is being used to control social media posts! judges declare the police is shooting the messengers instead of prosecuting those who glorify terrorists. I do not have to go to details as the editorial, \u2018From \u2018traitors\u2019 to \u2018racists\u2019 (The Island, 7 December) bares it all and do hope the new government takes the editor\u2019s warning seriously!",
