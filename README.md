Sri Lanka’s regulatory environment for the insurance sector is regarded as “developing with limited transparency,” according to Fitch Ratings.

In a report, Fitch cited the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka which oversees domestic insurers.

It introduced a risk-based capital (RBC) regime in 2015, which was fully adopted by insurers in 2016. The regime required insurers to maintain a minimum RBC ratio of 120%, and those with a ratio below 160% are required to submit a plan to improve their capitalisation levels.

The commission also enforces the segregation of life and non-life insurance businesses and requires all insurers to list on the local stock exchange to enhance transparency. However, exemptions are provided to insurers whose parent companies are listed on a recognised stock exchange.

### House of Cards: Sri Lanka’s sovereign bond fiasco and precarious balancing act of Central Bank

CBSL further obfuscates the situation by maintaining an air of secrecy around the current holders of ISBs

The Central Bank (CBSL) Governor’s sanguine assurances about Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability ring hollow in the face of Sri Lanka’s impending foreign exchange obligations. While the recently signed International Sovereign Bond (ISB) restructuring agreement is touted as a panacea, the reality paints a far grimmer picture. CBSL Governor’s nonchalant dismissal of a potential balance of payments crisis in the new year reminds of Pied Piper that led the rats of Hamelin to their grave while in a hallucinated trance.

“A Prosperous Country, A Beautiful Life” – the current Government’s policy statement – I am prepared to point out that the moment this Government came to power, they violated their electoral mandate and betrayed the people’s rights. In the same manner, fully agreeing to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) program can be considered the largest betrayal in recent times.

On page 105 of the ‘Prosperous Country, Beautiful Life’ policy document, there is an alternative debt sustainability analysis through which the NPP Government claims it would implement the understandings reached with the IMF.

Sri Lanka’s book industry has renewed its call for books to be exempt from tax, with four industry bodies submitting a proposal to the new government for inclusion in the next national budget.

Urging the government to consider the financial as well as social ramifications of taxing sources of knowledge and learning, these associations representing publishers, writers, retailers, importers and exporters have called for books to be returned to the list of items exempt from tax, as was the case before 1st January 2024.

In their proposal, the four associations pointed out that with all inputs for the publishing industry with the exception of local labour being imported, Sri Lanka’s book industry is already taxed at 33.045%, and the imposition of a value-added tax (VAT) of 18% at the point of sale has made books unaffordable to many, and is putting small-scale publishers out of business.

Sri Lanka’s book industry has renewed its call for books to be exempt from tax, with four industry bodies submitting a proposal to the new government for inclusion in the next national budget.

Urging the government to consider the financial as well as social ramifications of taxing sources of knowledge and learning, these associations representing publishers, writers, retailers, importers and exporters have called for books to be returned to the list of items exempt from tax, as was the case before January 1, 2024.

In their proposal, the four associations pointed out that with all inputs for the publishing industry with the exception of local labour being imported, Sri Lanka’s book industry is already taxed at 33.045%, and the imposition of a value-added tax (VAT) of 18% at the point of sale has made books unaffordable to many, and is putting small-scale publishers out of business.
