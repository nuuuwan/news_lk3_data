    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) unveiled the \u2018Corruption Risk Mapping Research: A Study on Sri Lanka\u2019s Private Sector\u2019 on Thursday (12) in Colombo, presenting an in-depth analysis of corruption risks.",
    "It also provides\u00a0possible measures to address the corruption in Sri Lanka\u2019s private sector.",
    "\u201cThe research, compiled by an independent researcher documents and narrates alleged experiences and examples of private sector corruption, possibly for the first time in Sri Lanka,\u201d the TISL said in a statement.",
    "\u201cCorruption in Sri Lanka for the most part has been seen as a public sector problem. This research, however, indicates that the private sector often functions as the \u201csupply side\u201d of corruption.\u201d",
    "\u201dThe allegations narrated showed a high risk of corruption when dealing with relevant government departments for approvals and licences across all industries.\u201d",
    "The report also has documented allegations of corruption when bidding for government contracts, particularly in relation to pharmaceuticals and large-scale infrastructure projects.",
    "The report comes under a new government which has been strongly backing anti-corruption measures.",
    "\u201cAllegations of corruption documented in the report between private sector entities includes kickbacks, gratifications and favours, fraud, unethical manipulation of procurement processes, conflicts of interest, nepotism and favouritism,\u201d the TISL said.",
    "\u201cInterestingly, the research also revealed allegations of private sector entities engaging in political lobbying and significant market manipulation through the creation of monopolies.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe research showed that gender dynamics also affected the nature of corruption. Respondents alleged that women were at a higher risk of being solicited for sexual bribes in exchange for jobs, promotions or even to provide a service.\u201d",
    "The report has highlighted while public listed companies are heavily regulated, their unlisted subsidiaries face fewer regulations.",
    "\u201cThis enables the parent company to outsource their corruption to a subsidiary or sub-subsidiary.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Report identifies the lack of a strong regulator, internal controls, and regular financial and social audits as some of the risk factors that lead to private sector corruption.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt has also been found that new market entrants often resort to corruption as a means of survival in the absence of a conducive business environment.\u201d",
    "The report has proposed the private sector to adopt robust anti-bribery and corruption policies with whistle-blower protection, and to pursue collective action to mitigate corruption.",
    "It has called on the Government to establish stronger regulatory bodies, digitalize processes, and enhance procurement practices. (Colombo/December 12/2024)"
