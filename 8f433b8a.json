    "Previously exempt items, such as certain goods and services, will now be subject to the 18% VAT, while many other goods will see an increase in VAT from 15% to 18%.",
    "Previously exempt items like diesel, petrol, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will now be subject to VAT.",
    "However, the existing 7.5% Ports and Airport Development Levy on these products will be scrapped.",
