    "Komal\u2019s morning view was of jagged, forbidding mountains, the rush of the river dozens of metres below the family home on the cliff. That was until the water became a torrent and tore the ground away beneath their feet.",
    "For generations, her family had lived among the orchards and green lands in the heart of the Hunza valley in the Karakorum mountains of Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan region.",
    "\u201cIn the morning everything was normal, I went to school,\u201d Komal says, \u201cbut then my teacher told me that Hassanabad bridge had collapsed.\u201d",
    "Upstream, a glacial lake had formed, then suddenly burst \u2013 sending water, boulders and debris cascading down the valley and gathering speed. The ground trembled so violently some people thought there was an earthquake.",
    "When the torrent hit the cement bridge that connected the two parts of the village, it turned it to rubble.",
    "A house in the damaged village of Hassanabad, with walls missing after the ground gave way [BBC]",
    "\u201cBy the time I came home, people were taking what they could out of their home,\u201d Komal says. She grabbed books, laundry, anything she could carry, but remembers thinking that with their house so far above the water there was no way it could be affected.",
    "That was until they received a phone call from the other side of the valley; their neighbours could see that the water was stripping away the hillside their home stood on.",
    "\u201cI remember my aunt and uncle were still inside their home when the flood came and washed out the whole kitchen,\u201d she says. The family made it to safe ground, but their homes disappeared over the edge.",
    "Today, walking through the grey rubble and dust, there are still coat hooks on the wall, a few tiles in the bathroom, a window with the glass long gone. It\u2019s been two years, but nothing has grown on the crumbling cliff that used to be Komal\u2019s garden in Hassanabad.",
    "\u201cThis used to be all a green place,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I visit this place I remember my childhood memories, the time I spent here. But the barren places, they hurt me, they make me feel sad.\u201d",
    "Life in the region is precarious. Water from the Hopper glacier can be seen here running through the valley it has carved [BBC]",
    "Climate change is altering the landscape across Gilgit-Baltistan and neighbouring Chitral, researchers say. This is just part of an area referred to by some as the Third Pole; a place which has more ice than any other part of the world outside the polar regions.",
    "If current emissions continue, Himalayan glaciers could lose up to two-thirds of their volume by the end of this century, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.",
    "According to the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), more than 48,000 people across Gilgit Baltistan and Chitral are considered to be at high risk from a lake outburst or landslide. Some, like the village of Badswat in the neighbouring district of Ghizer, are in such peril they are being evacuated entirely to relative safety, their homes rendered impossible to live in.",
    "\u201cClimate change has increased the intensity and frequency of disasters across the region,\u201d says Deedar Karim, programme co-ordinator for the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat.",
    "\u201cThese areas are highly exposed. With the increase in temperature, there are more discharges (of water) and then more flooding. It\u2019s causing damage to infrastructure, houses, agricultural lands; every infrastructure has been damaged by these increasing floods.",
    "\u201cThe rainfall pattern is changing. The snowfall pattern is changing and then the melting of the glacier is changing. So it\u2019s changing the dynamics of hazards.",
    "Pakistan is among the world\u2019s most at-risk countries from glacial lake outbursts [BBC]",
    "Moving populations is complicated; not only have many spent centuries on their land and are loath to leave it, but finding another location that is safe and has access to reliable water is complicated.",
    "\u201cWe have very limited land and limited resources. We don\u2019t have common lands to shift people to,\u201d says Zubair Ahmed, assistant director of the Disaster Management Authority in Hunza and Nagar district.",
    "\u201cI can say that after five or 10 years, it will be very difficult for us to even survive. Maybe people will realise after a few years or decades, but by then it will be too late. So I think this is the right time, although we are still late, but even now this is the time to think about it.\u201d",
    "Pakistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, although it is only responsible for less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "\u201cWe cannot stop these events, because this is a global issue,\u201d Mr Ahmed says. \u201cAll we can do is mitigate and get our people prepared to face such events.\u201d",
    "Ijaz is an emergency volunteer, trained in evacuations, first aid and mountain rescue [BBC]",
    "In the village of Passu, just over an hour\u2019s drive from Hassanabad, they are holding an evacuation drill; preparation for potential destruction. The population know that if there is an emergency, it may take days for outside help to arrive if the roads and bridges are blocked, damaged or swept away.",
    "Trained in first aid, river crossing and high mountain rescue, they practise evacuating the village a few times a year, volunteers carrying the wounded on stretchers and bandaging mock injuries.",
    "Ijaz has been a volunteer for the last 20 years, with many stories of rescuing lost walkers in the mountains. But he too is worried about the number of dangers and the increased unpredictability of the weather in the area he calls home.",
    "\u201cThe weather now, we just can\u2019t say what will happen,\u201d he says. \u201cEven five years ago, the weather didn\u2019t change as much. Now after half an hour we can\u2019t say what it will be.\u201d",
    "He knows too, that there\u2019s only so much his team of volunteers can do.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, if the flood comes and it\u2019s a heavy flood we can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThe area is totally washed out. If it\u2019s small then we can help people survive and escape the flood areas.\u201d",
    "If there is an emergency it may take days for outside help to arrive [BBC]",
    "There are other mitigation measures across the region; stone and wire barriers to try to slow floodwater, systems to monitor glacier melt, rainfall and water levels, speakers installed in villages to warn the community if danger looks likely. But many who work here say they need more resources.",
    "\u201cWe have installed early warning systems in some valleys,\u201d says Mr Ahmed. \u201cThese were identified by the Pakistan Meteorological Department and they gave us a list of around 100 valleys. But because of limited resources, we are only able to intervene in 16.\u201d",
    "Sultan Ali says he feels helpless \u2013 if the flood comes, it will take everything away [BBC]",
    "A few houses along from Komal lives Sultan Ali, now in his 70s.\u00a0 As we talk sitting on a traditional charpoy bed, his granddaughters bring us a plate of pears they\u2019ve picked from their garden.",
    "He knows that should another flood happen, his home could also disappear into the valley, but says he has nowhere to go.\u00a0 \u201cAs I approach the end of my life, I feel helpless,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe children are very worried, they ask where will we live?\u00a0 \u201cWe have no options. If the flood comes, it will take everything away and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I can\u2019t blame anyone; it\u2019s just our fate.\u201d",
    "Komal doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to stay \u2013 but they have nowhere else to go [BBC]",
    "We watch his grandchildren play tag in the shade of the orchard. The seasons, the ice, the environment is changing around them. What will this land look like when they are older?",
    "Komal too is not sure what the future will hold.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think we will stay here forever,\u201d she says. \u201cThe condition is clear already. But the question for us is we have no other place to go. Only this.\u201d",
