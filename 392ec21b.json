    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014\u00a0A United Nations agency and the United States have partnered with Sri Lanka\u2019s ministry of agriculture for a 9.2 million US dollar project to enhance paddy productivity, diversify crops on marginal land, and promote sustainable farming practices.",
    "The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the US government through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have partnered with the ministry for the project aimed at revitalising agriculture in the island nation.",
    "FAO said in a statement on Wednesday January 10 that USAID is funding the four-year extension of support to Sri Lankan paddy farmers, which will benefit 10,000 farmers across four districts: Hambanthota, Vauniya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala.",
    "\u201cFAO and the ministry will help farmers diversify use of 1,250 hectares of paddy lands during the Yala cultivation season to grow suitable cash crops. In addition, the activity will help farmers use resources such as water and fertiliser more efficiently across 5,000 acres of paddy. The funds also will help establish streamlined supply chains to ensure the timely availability of supplies and machinery to farmers at affordable prices,\u201d the organisation said.",
    "The project builds on the United States\u2019 2022 donation of 36,000 metric tons of Triple Super Phosphate and 9,800 metric tons of urea in the midst of the country\u2019s economic and food security crisis, which FAO and the ministry distributed to more than 1 million farmers, the FAO noted.",
    "\u201cOur paddy farmers underwent significant challenges over the past few years,\u201d Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was quoted as saying.",
    "\u201cUSAID and FAO provided essential fertiliser free of charge for more than 1 million paddy farmers in the country at a crucial time. This initiative builds on that support to continue ensuring increased incomes for the most vulnerable paddy farmers in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau said: \u201cOur mutual goals for crop diversification and agricultural efficiency are a natural extension of our work to increase productivity of Sri Lankan agriculture and improve the livelihoods of smallholder paddy farmers.\u201d",
    "FAO Representative Vimlendra Sharan called the partnership with USAID and the Ministry of Agriculture a \u201csignificant milestone in our commitment to continue to support Sri Lankan agriculture. By combining resources and expertise, we aim to bring about positive and sustainable changes for the farming community.\u201d",
    "The program seeks to contribute to the overall recovery of the agriculture sector, promoting increased yield and profitability for smallholder farmers, the statement said. (Colombo/Jan10/2024)"
