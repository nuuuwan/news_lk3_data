Colombo, May 9 (Daily Mirror) - Coral reefs in the sea around Sri Lanka risk die-offs if the current marine heat level persists for another one month or so, a top scientist said yesterday.

The Indian media reported that an alarming situation of severe coral bleaching had been reported in the Lakshadweep Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.

Asked for a comment in this regard, newly appointed Director General of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) Dr. K.Arulananthan told Daily Mirror the heat level had increased to 31 degrees Celsius and remained for two weeks.

He said NARA did not carry out any inspection on the status of coral reefs in the island waters but bleaching could not be ruled out.

“If the heat level fluctuates between 27-28 degrees Celsius, it will be alright for coral health. However, if the current high level persists for another one month or so, coral deaths can be expected,” he said.

“One could question whether Gamage who has been declared as a non-citizen of this country could register a political party. One could also question whether the MOU signed by SJB General Secretary with Ms.Gamage is legally valid.

Further the validity of nomination papers signed by Gamage for certain MPs is also questionable,” the Minister said.

“Some SJB MPs whom I chatted with at the House canteen informed me that they were worried about yesterday’s judgment of the Supreme Courts which ruled that Gamage cannot function as an MP as she is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.

They are concerned since they may have to give up their MP posts,” he added.

While this patriarchal practice is discriminatory – impugning the dignity of the child, who is a human being regardless of the relationship between his or her parents – I have no qualms on employing this practice on a policy document.

### Post-May Day political balance and scenarios

*2024-05-09 00:45:10* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Post-May-Day-political-balance-and-scenarios/4-761552) · `en`

Tyrannical Tiran Alles is about to learn a lesson in politics that his distinguished, respected father would have taught him had he been around. The worst time to play tough guy is in an election year with six months max to go to vote. Citizens (including officials) are impatient to vote, and are unintimidated because they know they have the power to bring the whole power structure down soon, if they so wish.

The Minister concerned is an unelected parliamentarian whose name has figured in disclosures by whistleblowing international journalists. He is attempting a witch-hunt against an articulate, courageous, mediagenic young man. He has antagonised the socially confident, sophisticated travel industry. Whatever his power (and cross-party connections), he is on a very slippery slope and may start the rockslide that takes the administration down with him.

### Government must fully digitalise Sri Lanka Customs

*2024-05-09 00:25:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Government-must-fully-digitalise-Sri-Lanka-Customs/108-282212) · `en`

The government must fully digitalise the services offered by the border agencies, including Sri Lanka Customs, to ensure paperless trade, which will facilitate exports and bring down the cost of living.

Although Sri Lanka Customs smoothly operated during the pandemic, offering fully digitalised services, the agency reverted to the manual process in the post-pandemic period, leaving room for corruption, along with delays and additional costs.

“Successive governments don’t have a drive and vision to go for digitalisation. Every single rupee incurred in port transport cost comes back to you. It’s passed down to the customer, so there goes the cost of living.

Through this press conference, we urge the government to look at a complete digitalisation, not a partial digitalisation because it’s a no go in today’s world economy,” Global Shippers’ Forum Chairman Sean Van Dort urged.

### The political ‘animals’  we choose

*2024-05-09 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-political-animals-we-choose/172-282189) · `en`

This seller of plastic balls at Galle Face Green is sure to know how customers make choices regarding his products, but he might find it difficult to choose which candidate to back during an election

Voters can quickly spot the political animal who is canvassing for votes–thanks to education; but people must be careful about the politician who can conceal the ‘animal’ within

The confidence Wickremesinghe gives people about the economy can be eclipsed by the love AKD is winning from the people

There is a school of thought that a debate between Sajith and AKD might not be the ideal at this juncture in politics; this is because both are working on winning the love of the people

We cannot change the political landscape of this country as long as we go to the polling booth and look for a candidate who is the best ‘choice’ in our search among those who are the least corrupt

How does the manifesto of each party or alliance defer from the Constitution of the country?

### Why A Tamil Common Candidate In The Presidential Election?

*2024-05-08 23:56:15* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/why-a-tamil-common-candidate-in-the-presidential-election/) · `en`

Tamils living in the north-east of Sri Lanka want to field a Tamil common candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Civil society activists have gathered and are discussing the fielding of a Tamil common candidate in the presidential election. It appears to be about 95 percent compliance.

A total of 46 civil organizations from the North East are moving this initiative together. No representatives of Tamil National Parties were included in it. The civil society organizations will meet with the Tamil National Parties and explain only after setting up a “Common Mechanism” regarding the issue of Tamil common candidates.

Civil society organizations are leading this initiative in a democratic way. Attempting to field a Tamil common candidate in the presidential election is not a racist act. It is a democratic right.

The Constitution of Sri Lanka does not directly say that a Tamil or a Muslim cannot hold the posts of President and Prime Minister.
