    "26-year-old Nagarasa Alex and another were arrested in the Nagakerny area on 11 November over allegations of committing a robbery and stealing Rs. 90,000 in cash and 16 \u00bd pounds of gold jewellery from a house. Alex later died on 19 November while receiving treatment at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital.",
    "Following his death, the post-mortem conducted by the Judicial Medical Officer at Jaffna Teaching Hospital revealed that the youth died due to kidney failure resulting from injuries sustained during an assault. The witness statement of the other suspect arrested along with Alex supported this finding.",

Both provided testimony during yesterday\u2019s hearing.",
