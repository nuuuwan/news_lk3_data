Firecrackers can be easily bought from roadside stalls and stores.

The United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung states that if the new government can strengthen the investment climate, implement anti-corruption measures, and strengthen business-friendly governance and transparency, there is potential for attracting more international manufacturers to invest in the country.

Joining the groundbreaking ceremony for Indiana-based SHIELD company’s new seatbelt factory in Sri Lanka, the US Ambassador said that SHIELD’s decision to shift its facility in China to establish a manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka is a testament to the growing interest of U.S. investment in Sri Lanka.

“The United States is already the largest export market for Sri Lanka, and it’s wonderful to see greater U.S. investment directly here, as well.  We want to see even greater bilateral trade and investment expand both ways in the years to come”, she added.

### Anurakumara Dissanayake and the creation of the national people's power

*2024-10-31 13:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197579) · `ta`

Based on the detailed historical and political analysis provided, here are the key points regarding the JVP and its evolution:



1. The JVP initially pursued revolutionary violence but shifted towards democratic methods after the armed conflicts in 1971 and 1988-90.



2. In the 2015 parliamentary election, the JVP received 543,944 votes (4.8%) and won six seats.



3. The party contested alone in 2015 instead of joining an opposition coalition.



4. In the 2018 local government elections, the JVP received 693,875 votes (6.27%) but failed to capture any councils.



5. The JVP formed the National People's Power alliance in 2019, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.



6. In the 2019 presidential election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake received 418,563 votes (3.15%) as the National People's Power candidate.



7. In the 2020 parliamentary election, the National People's Power received 445,958 votes (3.84%), winning three seats.



8. Despite efforts to increase its vote bank, the JVP has struggled to overcome its status as the third political power in Sri Lanka.



9. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been instrumental in changing the electoral strategy and enriching his political image within the party.



10. The JVP continues to maintain its independence and does not want to form coalitions or alliances with other parties, preferring to lead as an equal partner.



The analysis suggests that while the JVP has made some progress in recent years, it still faces challenges in increasing its vote share and electoral performance compared to the major political parties in Sri Lanka.

🟩

This is the fourth part of my article on Sri Lanka's new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

In the first part, I wrote about his gradual development in the second part of the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the second part and his rise to the JVP leadership in the third part.

The JVP led by Dissanayake in this fourth part. Let me explain how the national people's power was transformed into a party.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is an important day on February 2, 2014. It was on that day that the 17th National Conference of the JVP was held.

The change in the leadership of the party was the best of the conference. Somawansa Amarasinghe, who has been the leader of the JVP for 24 years, took over.

Anura or AKD. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, popularly known, arrived as the new leader of the JVP.

It was generally revealed before the conference that Somawansa is going to retire from the post of Chairman.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka aims to conclude its debt restructuring process by year-end, with expectations for a prompt exit from the default rating category soon after, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told Economynext in an interview in Washington, D.C. this week.

“To complete the process, certain procedures must be followed,  including documentation, due diligence, and related formalities,” Weerasinghe said.

“It will take 2-3 weeks to complete the debt exchange and get the investor participation. That will take some time. The idea is to complete before end-December,” Weerasinghe said.

Backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international advisors, Sri Lanka has secured a debt restructuring agreement with its official creditors and reached an in-principle deal with the private creditors.

The arrangement with the bondholders includes macro-linked bonds tied to the island nation’s economic growth trajectory.

The public appears to be pleased with most of the measures the President and the interim Cabinet have taken in this regard. Yet there is much more to be done. The recent allegations made against the NPP that its economic policy framework envisages a protectionist economy is also baseless. Ensuring food, energy and water security does not require an economy to be protectionist. Many developed and neo-liberal economies that are said to be open, have resorted to such economic strategies.
