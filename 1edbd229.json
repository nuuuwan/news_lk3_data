    "This was revealed when the Fundamental Rights petition, filed by Women & Media Collective organization seeking an order suspending the Presidential Pardon granted by former President Sirisena to Shramantha Jude, was taken up for further argument yesterday.",
    "The petition was considered before the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices S. Thurairaja, Yasantha Kodagoda and Janak de Silva.",
    "Justice Yasantha Kodagoda said that although the reports of the High Court Judge and the Court of Appeal Judge who sentenced Shramanta Jude, should be called, they have not done so according to the constitutional provision.",
    "President's Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena, who appeared for the petitioner, said that, Parthikan, the Assistant Secretary of then President Sirisena, had forwarded a letter to the Attorney General containing the names of the persons who made verbal requests to grant presidential pardon to convict Jayamaha.",

And also the President's Office had not received the Attorney General's instructions regarding the granting of presidential pardon to Jayamaha.",
    "Justice Kodagoda :- According to this process, does it appear that President Maithripala Sirisena has been misled?",
