    "A senior Tamil Judge in the war-torn district of Mullaitheevu has resigned from his post and has fled the country fearing for the safety of his life.",
    "Mullaitheevu District Judge and Magistrate T. Saravanarajah has said his life is under threat in his letter of resignation sent to the Judicial Services Commission on 23 September.",
    "\u201cI hereby inform you that I resign my post of District Judge, post of Magistrate, post of family court Judge, post of primary court Judge, post of small claims court Judge, post of Juvenile court Judge due to threat of my life and due to lot of stress\u201d.",
    "The judge is no more in the country, according to journalists in the Wanni. This is the first judge in recent years to flee the country.",
    "He has been continuously hounded by racist comments and intimidating remarks from hardline Sinhala MPs in particular Sarath Weerasekara from the Sri Lanka Podujana Party led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Justice Saravanarajah was summoned by the Attorney General to his office on the 21st of September and pressurized to amend his judgments regarding Kurunthoormalai, say unconfirmed sources from the region familiar with the case.",
    "According to Sri Lankan law, the Attorney General doesn\u2019t have powers to summon a Judge, only the Judicial commission can. But in this case, it is reliably learnt AG Rajaratnam invited him not under the guise of a discussion, but in a more personal way and pressurised to amend his kurunthurmalai judgement.",
    "Saravanarajah had earlier gone on record saying a Buddhist Vihara is being constructed in spite of his ruling  and also allowed the Tamils to offer Pongal to the Adhi Sivan Ayyanar deity at the place.",
    "Both Tamils and Sinhalese claim Kurunthoormalai to be religiously, historically, and culturally very significant to them.",
    "MP Sarath Weerasekara has criticized Saravanarajah\u2019s rulings  and called him names in the Parliament using his privileges in the house; which was strongly denounced by the Tamil MPs.",
    "He even accused the Judge of suffering from mental illness and warned him that he is living in a Sinhala Buddhist country. MP Weerasekara spewed racist comments against Judge Saravanarajah and went to the extent of saying he is living in a Sinhala Buddhist country. His racist comments include \u201cMullaitheevu magistrate granting permission to Pongal festival at Kurunthoormalai is similar to Mt.Lavinia Magistrate giving permission to chant Pirith in a Siva temple at Wellawatte\u201d.",
    "Lawyers in North and East while condemning MP Sarath Weerasekara for his racist comments against the Tamil Judge and misuse of his Parliamentary privileges staged protests against him and even demanded his transfer.",
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka also expressed their solidarity with the protesting lawyers and had emphasized the responsibility of the government and all other institutions to respect the independence of the judiciary.",
    "Justice Saravanarajah\u2019s police security was also downgraded recently and was subjected to constant surveillance by the state intelligence services.",
    "Senior Tamil MP from the Tamil National Alliance Sivagnanam Siritharan said \u201cThe resignation of Justice Saravanarajah is a big blow to the judiciary in the country and has shaken the foundations of independence of the judicial system\u201d.",
    "Strongly condemning the insults and intimidation meted out to Justice Saravanarajah MP Siritharan recalled the assassination attempt against the then Tamil Magistrate in Jaffna Mrs. Sirinithi Nanthasekaran in the middle of the year 2000 and said now yet another attempt to threaten a Tamil Judge has happened openly and that too within the Parliament\u201d.",
    "Adding further the Jaffna district MP said \u201cif a Judge can be threatened and forced to flee the country what would be the fate of the Tamils living in the North and East?\u201d",
    "\u201cThis is an example of religious oppression and how powerful racist elements act in this country. I appeal to the international community to take note of such happenings against the Tamils at least now\u201d.",
    "TPA leader and Colombo District MP Mano Ganesan commenting on the resignation of Mullaitheevu Judge T.Saravanarajah fearing threast on  his lfe said \u201d Even the little bit of the rule of the law left in country have been challenged directly now. The President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam owe  the nation an answer \u201d"
