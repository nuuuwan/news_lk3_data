  "original_title": "UN COP28: What to know about the climate summit in Dubai",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "World leaders, government representatives and delegates are set to gather for the annual United Nations climate change summit, known as the Conference of the Parties or COP28\u00a0 in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).",
    "Reining in fossil fuels and carbon emissions are expected to be topping the agenda of the 13-day summit (November 30 to December 12). International funding to help countries adapt to climate change will also be hotly debated as developing countries have been demanding more contributions from the industrialised nations.",
    "An ambitious loss and damages fund agreed last year to support poorer nations to help manage the negative effects of climate change has yet to be put into place. World leaders agreed to the fund after COP27 last year, but they have failed to reach consensus on the most important questions of all \u2013 which states will pay into it and how much.",
    "Countries will also face the first review of their progress towards the Paris Agreement,\u00a0 a landmark international treaty on limiting carbon emissions that was signed at the COP21, almost eight years ago.",
    "Although the UAE was the first Middle Eastern country to ratify the agreement, people are deeply divided over hosting the summit in a nation that has been termed as part of the problem for its reliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Some are now also criticising the inclusion of oil and gas-linked representatives in such summits at all.",
    "As the debate around COP28 and its impact continues, here\u2019s what to know about this year\u2019s conference and what makes it significant.",
    "COP is the primary decision-making body of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established in 1992.",
    "Representatives of 197 countries who have signed or are \u201cparties\u201d to the UNFCCC will participate primarily through debates and negotiations.",
    "COP28 will begin on November 30 and continue for almost two weeks, while the exact schedule for each day will be published a night prior. Pre-sessions for the conference began on November 24.",
    "The COP28 will take place in the backdrop of devastating floods and heatwaves, fierce wildfires and the Earth\u2019s hottest summer on record this year.",
    "The event is considered an opportunity for countries to better rein in climate change by devising improved targets and measures through tools such as finance, technology and capacity-building.",
    "The conference comes weeks after a UN report said greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a record high in 2022. Based on countries\u2019 current climate plans, the report says, global carbon emissions by 2030 will be cut by only two percent compared with 2019 levels, far short of the 43 percent fall needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial levels.",
    "Although the 1.5 degree Celsius target became binding in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the goal was first adopted after COP16, more than a decade ago.",
    "A report from the World Meteorological Organization in May also found that with current trends, the world may temporarily breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius target in 2027.",
    "As states scramble to catch up before climate change risks spike further, they will not be immune to crises around the world.",
    "\u201cFor years parties have been struggling to agree to a fossil fuel phase-out, and the challenge to reach an agreement was made worse by the fiscal crises precipitated by the pandemic and energy crisis following the war in Ukraine,\u201d said Olivia Rumble, director of Climate Legal in South Africa.",
    "A primary objective of COP each year is to review and calibrate the implementation of the UNFCCC terms, Paris Agreement,\u00a0 and Kyoto Protocol, a binding treaty agreed in 1997 for industrialised nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "This year, member states will negotiate while facing their first Global Stocktake (GST) \u2013 a scorecard analysing countries\u2019 progress towards the Paris Agreement \u2013 so they can adapt their next climate action plans which are due in 2025.",
    "\u201cCountries will be hard-pressed to make concessions to agree on the principal reasons for historic failures and what they believe needs to be done going forward to make meaningful progress on the agreement\u2019s goals,\u201d said Rumble.",
    "Parties will also seek to operationalise the loss and damages fund after developing nations proposed in September that developed countries should disperse at least $100bn to them by 2030.",
    "Additionally, this year\u2019s presidency has set four themes to be at the forefront of the summit:",
    "Fast-tracking the energy transition:\u00a0 revolves around renewable energy, and food and agricultural systems.",
    "Fixing climate finance: aims to prioritise the Global South in adaptation finance and help vulnerable communities rebuild after climate disasters, among other targets.",
    "Nature, people, lives, and livelihoods: geared towards food systems, nature-based solutions, and protecting against extreme weather events and biodiversity loss.",
    "Inclusivity, in climate management: includes youth involvement and improved communication between different sectors and agencies.",
    "However, focusing on specific themes such as financing strategies must also be accompanied by a revamping of global structures to be effective across the world.",
    "While this year\u2019s climate financing agenda aims to better support developing nations with emergency funding, such mechanisms currently lack effective needs analysis and involve the inefficient distribution of funds. High debts imposed on such countries through global financing structures also reduce their ability to invest in the maintenance of climate projects.",
    "\u201cRenewable energy and energy efficiency will mean little to African countries without significant reforms to the global financial architecture to make these targets achievable. This includes revising risk ratings and perception of investment risk in Africa,\u201d said Rumble.",
    "More than 140 heads of state, senior government leaders and at least 70,000 participants are expected to attend COP28.",
    "Some of the notable figures who have confirmed their attendance so far include:",
    "Britain\u2019s King Charles III, who will also deliver an address at the opening ceremony",
    "US President Joe Biden is not expected to attend but the country will be represented by top officials such as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.",
    "The summit will be divided into a \u201cblue zone\u201d with sessions for UN-accredited participants such as state representatives only, and a \u201cgreen zone\u201d with events and exhibits for registered participants from the public and civil society.",
    "Many environmentalists and other analysts have raised concerns about COP28\u2019s choice of president.",
    "Sultan al-Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, has been tasked with changing the world\u2019s climate course while the company he heads is one of the world\u2019s largest oil producers. The UAE is the world\u2019s seventh-largest liquid fuel producer.",
    "In May, al-Jaber faced criticism for referring to the need to phase out \u201cfossil fuel emissions\u201d \u2014 using techniques such as carbon capture \u2014 instead of phasing out fossil fuels themselves.",
    "Others have questioned the UNFCCC for involving the fossil fuel industry in its discussions and failing to generate sufficient progress towards the 1.5-degree goal.",
    "In September, more than 200 civil society organisations, including Amnesty International, wrote an open letter to the UAE government to follow certain demands in the lead-up to COP28. On top of calling for labour reforms, and abandoning plans to step up oil and gas production, the letter demanded that the UAE refrain from surveilling COP28 attendees.",
    "The country has said it will allow environmental activists to \u201cassemble peacefully\u201d for protest acts during the summit.",
