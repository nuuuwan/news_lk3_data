The Spot Admissions Program allows students to participate in a specialized event where they can secure their offer letters within a matter of hours.",
    "ICFS Director H.P. Vidanage announced during a press briefing that students can expect to receive their offer letters within approximately two hours on the same day. This expeditious admission process greatly simplifies the journey for students, eliminating lengthy waiting periods and reducing uncertainty.",
    "This program follows the immense success of a similar event held in Colombo last month, where numerous students were able to secure their university admissions within two hours. The overwhelming response and a large number of requests from students seeking this streamlined process prompted ICFS to organize another spot admission day.",

    "Meanwhile, David Samuel, head- of Sri Lanka and Maldives for Wrexham University, UK and International Marketing consultant for Excelsia College Australia said that Wrexham, in Redwood City, is based out in Wales in the United Kingdom and it has about 9,000 students and among them around 1,200 to 1,500 are international students.",
    "\u201c We have five demand intakes in a particular year for international students. So the next available intake will be towards the end of January which will be for MSC and MBA students in the business stream. We also have a special announcement to make for young children who are coming out of the A/L Science stream. We give them a full scholarship is three years fully covered by the university or the Welsh Government, which gives them up to 16,500 pounds worth of scholarship for three years. So it's a great opportunity. And I think for September this year, we have two young Sri Lankan students to join us and we have about eight to 15 spots for the next intake next year. So we will start the admission process somewhere towards December, January. So they will be able to come and join us,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, Thilina Rajapaksa, Senior Regional Manager at Apply Board who represents the Canadian apply board said that Canadian education has become ever more popular in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWe represent more than 130 public colleges and universities. There are many options for students ranging from O/L through to Advanced levels. The January intake is now open and among the few benefits of studying in Canada would be the quality of education and the affordability. Causes range in Canada from $15,000 to about $25,000. You will get a credited engineering program in Canada where you can study for approximately $70,000,\u201d he said.",
