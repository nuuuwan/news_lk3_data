    "Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva strongly criticized the SriLankan cockpit crew claiming that they refused to cooperate to operate the scheduled flight even when a co-officer was sick.",
    "\u201cThere were 20 more first officers when the first officer on duty fell ill and they were off-duty.\u00a0 I telephoned them and requested to fly the plane as the passengers are in distress. None of them responded positively and offered to fly the flight in the absence of their co-officer. This is the bitter truth. In the past, officers offered to cooperate in such instances for the sake of the country and the airline. But, none of the 20 officers came,\u201d he accused.",
