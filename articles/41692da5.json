    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Public sector unions in Sri Lanka have urged the government to add 20,000 rupees to their basic salaries as opposed to ad hoc allowances to reflect increased living costs.",
    "At a joint press conference held on Monday May 13, representatives from a number of public sector trade unions called for an increase in their basic pay.",
    "\u201cThere are many expenses that government workers cannot afford such as transport costs, children\u2019s education fees, inflation caused by various taxes, all of which they have had to bear under severe strain,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe urge the government to add an amount to the government workers\u2019 basic salary, an amount that they can sustain themselves on,\u201d he added.",
    "General secretary of the Joint Health Services Association Tampitiye Sugathananda thero told reporters at the press conference that increasing the basic salary is important as government pensions are calculated based on workers\u2019 basic pay.",
    "\u201cIn many sectors, government workers are paid less than 50,000 rupees as basic pay. Pensions are based on basic salary. Allowances are increased marginally but there is no increase in basic salary to reflect increased cost of living,\u201d he complained.",
    "Chairman of the Development Officers Trade Union Federation Attorney-at-law Anuradha Seneviratne said the basic salary of government workers has not seen an increase in eight years.",
    "\u201cUntil there is a permanent basic salary increase under a national policy for the entire public service, we are ready to take trade union action with other unions in the government sector,\u201d he said. (Colombo/May14/2024)"
