    "Realistic decision-makers base their choices on facts and strategic alignment with the company\u2019s aims",
    "In today\u2019s highly competitive marketplace, company success is dependent on the capacity of management to respond to corporate challenges which require strategic thinking. This entails not just imagining long-term goals that are consistent with an organisation\u2019s mission, but also spotting market possibilities and risks. Strategic thinking necessitates a thorough knowledge of market trends, competitive dynamics, and internal strengths and limitations (Goldman, 2012). Nevertheless, many leaders pursue strategic thinking with an idealistic perspective, developing unrealistic approaches to company difficulties. As a result, solutions may be impractical and fail to successfully address real-world problems.",
    "Realistic thinking prioritises fact-based decision-making, concentrating on current restrictions, resources that are accessible, and market dynamics. Realistic leaders employ data, industry insights, and evaluations of risk to develop flexible strategies that can assist avoid future setbacks. Although realism is sometimes confused with pessimism, this practical attitude promotes resilience, allowing firms to handle hurdles and remain stable throughout economic downturns (Steiner, 2009). Idealistic thinking, on the other hand, focuses on values, aspiration, and opportunities without taking into account constraints. While this viewpoint can foster creativity, it frequently overlooks crucial restrictions, resulting in a tendency to set excessively ambitious goals without taking into account probable obstacles (Mintzberg, 1994).",
    "Given the complex nature and uncertainties of today\u2019s corporate world, leaders must take a realistic approach to addressing challenges, managing resources, and making informed decisions. Here are a few arguments why realism is important:",
    "Realistic thinking enables leaders to examine challenges by examining facts, finding trends, and evaluating risks. This technique prevents overconfidence and allows leaders to foresee challenges while building contingency measures. For example, during times of recession, organisations that apply accurate cash flow estimates and budgeting assessments can make critical cost-cutting decisions, allowing them to thrive while competitors struggle (Liedtka, 1998).",
    "With scarce resources, leaders with a realistic perspective deploy cash, labour, and other resources to places where they are most needed, avoiding the wasteful practices that come with overly ambitious goals. A technological startup, for example, may choose to launch a minimum-viable offering rather than a full-scale launch, so preserving resources while meeting market demand. Idealistic leaders, on the other hand, may overcommit resources to large undertakings, risking exhaustion without obtaining the desired results (Steiner, 2009).",
    "Realistic decision-makers base their choices on facts and strategic alignment with the company\u2019s aims. They avoid being too optimistic, instead focusing on making gradual advancement toward sustainable growth. For example, a retail chain that is facing increased competition may contemplate overseas growth. While idealism may drive for quick entrance into various markets, a pragmatic approach would be to test a few key sites first, reducing risk and optimising the plan (Goldman, 2012).",
    "Realism does not exclude creativity; rather, it allows innovation to be explored within reasonable constraints. Companies may produce sustainable innovations by establishing clear, attainable goals, identifying risks, and allocating resources effectively. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, firms that adapted to remote work thrived by realistically assessing operational and technological requirements, resulting in long-term solutions that benefited both the organisation and its personnel (Christensen et al., 2006).",
    "Blockbuster failed to respond to initial developments toward digital streaming, eventually declaring insolvency in 2010 when it was too late to change.",
    "Nokia: Once a mobile phone market leader, Nokia\u2019s reliance on an old operating system hindered it from moving to smartphone technology, resulting in a downfall and purchase by Microsoft.",
    "Sears: Sears\u2019 idealistic belief in its brand strength caused it to ignore e-commerce, resulting in collapse as competitors apprised (Christensen et al., 2006).",
    "These instances demonstrate how idealism, when not tempered with realism, may lead to poor strategic planning and, eventually, failure.",
    "Effective management maintains a balance between reality and idealism. While idealism allows people to establish lofty goals, realism anchors their ambitions in attainable strategies. Setting reasonable goals, continually monitoring progress, and reacting to environmental adjustments all improve resilience, allowing businesses to grab opportunities without taking on too much risk (Mintzberg, 1994).",
    "Realism not only influences decision-making, but it also promotes a culture of transparency, responsibility, and openness to new challenges. The management that model realistic thinking foster an environment in which workers are encouraged to establish attainable objectives and confront problems, building resilience and a proactive attitude to issue resolution (Liedtka, 1998).",
    "Both realism and idealism assume crucial roles in corporate planning, but realism is required for overcoming obstacles and establishing long-term success. Leaders that base their strategy on a thorough grasp of market dynamics, resource limits, and dangers are better positioned to handle today\u2019s complicated environment. Integrating realism with idealism allows organisations to avoid typical errors and pursue development in ways that are both visionary and practical. Learning from mistakes is crucial for long-term success, but it needs leaders to embrace openness and thoroughly review both triumphs and setbacks in order to drive future initiatives and promote resilience throughout the organisation.",
