### US again vetoes UN Security Council Gaza ceasefire call

*2025-09-19 07:59:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112660/us-again-vetoes-un-security-council-gaza-ceasefire-call) · `en`

The United States on Thursday (Sep 18) again wielded its veto and thwarted a UN Security Council call for a ceasefire in Gaza, shielding its ally Israel from meaningful diplomatic pressure.

The 14 other members of the Council backed the resolution, initiated in August in response to the UN’s official declaration of famine after nearly two years of Israel’s war on Hamas in the Palestinian territory.

The vote came as Israeli tanks and jets pounded Gaza City, the target of a major new ground offensive, forcing Palestinians to flee south.

The resolution text seen by AFP had demanded “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties” as well as the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.

The US has repeatedly rejected that approach multiple times, most recently in June when it used its veto to back Israel.

A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia’s far eastern Kamchatka peninsula early Friday (Sep 19), rocking buildings and prompting authorities to issue a tsunami alert, later lifted.

Videos posted on Russian social media showed furniture and light fixtures shaking in homes, while another showed a parked car rocking back and forth on a street.

The quake struck 128km east of the region’s capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and at a shallow depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported.

The local branch of Russia’s state geophysical service gave a lower estimated magnitude of 7.4. It reported at least five aftershocks.

The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for possible hazardous waves along nearby coastlines, but said several hours later that the threat had passed.

“This morning is once again testing the resilience of Kamchatka residents,” the governor of the region, Vladimir Solodov, said on Telegram.

I’ve always wanted to experience the energy, beauty, and rich culture of Sri Lanka first-hand,” adding that his focus will be on strengthening bilateral ties.

At a bustling Colombo market, he pointed to trade as a cornerstone of the partnership.

“Australians drink a lot of Ceylon Tea, but did you know Sri Lankans love Australian lentils? In fact, 85% of the lentils in this market are from Australia. We’re even helping Sri Lanka become a processing hub for the entire region,” he explained.

### The year that was: thrashing  towards NPP’s thriving nation

*2025-09-19 06:29:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-year-that-was-thrashing-towards-NPP-s-thriving-nation/4-781895) · `en`

That the NPP-dominated House is starting to walk the talk on promises that its leader made on his remarkable campaign trail must redound to the credit of every one of those 159 National People’s Power MPs

As the first year of a House commandeered by the NPP has come round, it is timely, appropriate and opportune to examine the track record of a tyro government in the 365 days just past.

It is timely because the traditional honeymoon period, in which a people content from only recently casting the ballot cut a newbie administration a gracious slice of charitable slack, is now over.

And there is no more appropriate a motive than keeping the NPP, led by the JVP, those vociferous critics of past regimes, accountable in just and similar vein.

Also opportune because the National People’s Power produced a fait accompli to coincide with its first anniversary in parliament and in power to justify its erstwhile campaign trail promises.

### Sri Lanka’s hollow democracy: Need to awaken and reclaim our nation

Parliamentarians no longer represent the people but act as protectors of privilege, brokers of fraud, and breakers of law

I often wonder whether our nation’s founders ever paused to reflect before adopting the foundational principles of Democratic, Socialist, and Republic to define the country. A nation’s self-identification shapes not only its domestic policies but also its relationship with its people and its place in the world. Misinterpreting or inconsistently applying these terms risks deep conflict, ideological, institutional, and social, which we have adequately experienced. Before judging the merits of this identity, we must return to the fundamentals of democracy: does it serve some of the people some of the time, or all of the people all of the time?

The Tamil Nadu fishers have displayed unbelievable hostility and animus towards their Tamil speaking counterparts in Sri Lanka

The ongoing problem of illegal fishing and bottom trawling in Sri Lanka’s northern territorial waters by Indian fishers from Tamil Nadu state was described in detail in the first part of this article published last week. Particular attention was devoted to the bogey of Katchatheevu being raised by the Indian side to sidetrack the issue. As emphasised previously the fundamental problem is illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters and not the question of Katchatheevu islet ownership. Certain salient points regarding the illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu fishers will be related in this second and final part of this article.

### Crossing the Tax Rubicon

*2025-09-19 06:09:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Crossing-the-Tax-Rubicon/4-781891) · `en`

Like Caesar’s crossing of the Rubicon, every tax decision carries lasting consequences

The phrase “crossing the Rubicon” has travelled from ancient Rome into modern language as a metaphor for making a decision from which there is no turning back. Its origins date to 49 BCE, when Julius Caesar, confronted with a political deadlock, led his army across the Rubicon River an act that defied the Roman Senate and marked the beginning of a civil war that forever changed Rome’s destiny. As Caesar reportedly declared, “The die is cast.” In that single moment, he understood that there was no possibility of retreat, only the certainty of consequences. The step across the river was not just military defiance; it was the point of no return, carrying outcomes that would reshape both his own fate and the future of the Republic.
