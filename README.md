ரயில் ஒன்று நடைமேடைக்கு வருவதற்கு சற்று முன்னதாக, பிளாட்பாரத்தில் குண்டு வெடித்ததாக, முதற்கட்ட விசாரணையில் தெரியவந்துள்ளது.

பெஷாவரில் இருந்து ஜாஃபர் எக்ஸ்பிரஸ் சரியாக 9 மணிக்கு வர இருந்தது. இருப்பினும், குறித்த ரயில் அந்நேரத்துக்கு வந்திருந்தால், பலி எண்ணிக்கை மிகப்பெரிய அளவில் அதிகரித்திருக்கும்.

“தற்கொலை படை மூலம் இந்த தாக்குதல் நடத்தப்பட்டிருக்கலாம். ஆனால், முன்னதாகவே அந்த முடிவுக்கு வர முடியாது. குண்டு வெடிப்பு எப்படி நடைபெற்றது என்பதை அறிய விசாரணை நடைபெற்று வருகிறது. குண்டு வெடிப்பு நடைபெற்ற போது ரயில் நிலையத்தில் சுமார் 100 பேர் இருந்தனர்” என குவெட்டா பொலிஸார் தெரிவித்தனர்.AN

### Gaza women, children are nearly 70% of verified war dead, UN rights office says

*2024-11-09 08:28:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103269/gaza-women-children-are-nearly-70-of-verified-war-dead-un-rights-office-says) · `en`

The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70% of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.

The U.N. tally since the start of the war, in which Israel’s military is fighting Hamas militants, includes only fatalities it has managed to verify with three sources, and counting continues.

The 8,119 victims verified is a much lower number than the toll of more than 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the 13-month-old war. But the U.N. breakdown of the victims’ age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war.

This finding indicates “a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality”, the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report.

### Sri Lanka remittances $587.7mn in October, up 13.9-pct

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming from its overseas expatriate workers gained 13.9 percent to $587.7 million in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The total remittances in the first 10 months of this year also crossed $5.4 billion with a 11.7 percent gain compared to $4.7 billion in the same period in the last year, the latest Central Bank data showed.

Worker remittances are one of the top foreign exchange revenue earners for the island nation which is still recovering from an unprecedented economic crisis hit in 2022.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods.

As we have previously pointed out, though IMF programs appear to solely focus on development, they do not cater to or deal with matters that affect socio-economic justice and a fair go. Their only formula is one of liberalising markets for generating more profits for investors, with drastic cuts to social welfare benefits and expanding the tax base for increased revenue.

The IMF does not look into the socio-economic equity issues that are prevalent and predominant in most of the societies the world over, including in Sri Lanka. The theory of trickle-down economics[1] underpins their practice. However, nowhere has this theory once implemented been a success in terms of economic development, social stability, and an equitable sharing of the financial burden.

### Does it matter to the world who the next President of the USA is?

*2024-11-08 23:48:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Does-it-matter-to-the-world-who-the-next-President-of-the-USA-is/4-769020) · `en`

While it is unlikely that any well-meaning President would have exercised such powers indiscriminately and without good reason, the overall global situation today of a world near chaos, and the instances of US involvement in numerous countries and in conflicts and their failure to exercise their powers to prevent conflict or at least to minimise them and take the leadership in finding solutions through discussion and negotiation, have left open the question on the effectiveness of the US President when it comes to world affairs

Paradox of Power: Militarily it is a unipolar world of U.S. hegemony; economically it is a multipolar world with U.S. leadership; but on many transnational issues – such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the migration of people, epidemic disease, drugs, and environmental degradation – we live in a world only a step or two short of chaos (https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/american-power-the-world)

Putting a halt to crossovers is one of the key promises that the NPP made to people during our election campaigns. Now we are ready to fulfil these pledges through the right process. All our promises to the people have been spelt out in the NPP’s manifesto. When the law is implemented, the Parliamentarians can cross over to any political party that they wish but they will lose their seats at the Parliament. This will be a common law for all political parties

Reiterates that MPs who crossed over will lose their seats under new laws

Confirms NPP has fielded fresh set of politicians who have no corruption charges

### A new hope to sweep a House clean?

The citizenry vote for political leaders in the hope that ‘this time’ there will be change for the better; and the electorate is disappointed time and again

Ah – yes, the old lie: that the hope of a nation resides in the chamber where chairs are thrown at critics and chillies are employed to evict policemen keen on restoring law and order.

And a major reason for the electorate in general and political pundits in particular being so cynical about the assembly we unmindfully describe as being august is in both the character and performance of the legislators we elected – lest we forget, let us remember and chide ourselves!

As a senior journalist observed in these columns not many moons ago: “Sri Lanka has chronically elected crooks, charlatans, the incompetent, the corrupt, and the utterly unrepentant of their litany of crimes.”

Muslim Personal Law Reform Action Group yesterday in a statement said that Minister Vijitha Herath’s comments that Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) reforms are not on the agenda fails to recognise longstanding demands for change.

We are deeply concerned about the recent remarks made by Minister Vijitha Herath that no need has arisen to change the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) at this juncture. The comments fail to recognise the long journey towards MMDA reforms in Sri Lanka. For decades, Muslim women and groups have raised concerns about the serious discrimination and harm experienced by Muslim women, girls and families as a consequence of this law. The comments dismiss the grave impacts that Muslim women and girls continue to face on a daily basis due to discrimination under the current MMDA and Quazi system.
