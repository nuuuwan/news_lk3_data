    "The IRD has encountered significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets. As of October 2023, the IRD collected 82% of the projected revenue, amounting to Rs. 740 billion out of an expected Rs. 908 billion.",
    "The slowdown in collection was particularly noticeable in the second half of the year, attributed to the Central Bank\u2019s interest rate policy directive in August, which impacted corporate tax inflow. Financial institutions, which are major contributors to corporate taxes, have been affected by the monetary policy, leading to a shortfall in Government revenue.",
    "The IRD set ambitious targets for corporate taxes at Rs. 603 billion and non-corporate taxes at Rs. 305 billion for 2023. By October, 77% of the corporate taxes and 91% of the non-corporate taxes were collected.",
    "The 2024 Budget aims to increase tax revenue to Rs. 4 trillion, up from Rs. 3 trillion in 2023, with a significant portion expected from taxes on income and profit.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s tax collection issues are not solely due to economic policies but also systemic inefficiencies and corruption within the IRD. Additionally, the country\u2019s legal framework allows individuals to submit four appeals without paying taxes, leading to a backlog that can take up to 15 years to process.",
    "When compared to other countries with similar GDP per capita, Sri Lanka\u2019s tax to GDP ratio is significantly lower. For instance, Morocco and Georgia, with comparable GDP per capita, collect 24% of GDP as tax revenue, while Sri Lanka collects only 11%. This discrepancy indicates a need for structural reforms to improve tax revenue collection.",
    "I would like to say, The IRD\u2019s struggle to meet tax collection targets is a multifaceted issue involving economic policies, systemic inefficiencies, and legal frameworks. I would delve into each of these points more thoroughly, discussing the implications of the Central Bank\u2019s policies, the specific challenges faced by different sectors, the strategies proposed by the IRD, and the broader context of tax collection in middle-income countries. Additionally, I would analyse the potential reforms and international best practices that could be adopted to enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s revenue collection efficiency.",
    "Systemic issues: The IRD faces several systemic challenges that hinder efficient tax collection:",

    "Resistance to change: Although younger administrators are eager to adopt digital systems, there is resistance among senior officials. Training programs and identifying issues crucial for adopting new systems are necessary steps.",
    "Legal framework: The legal framework in Sri Lanka allows individuals to submit up to four appeals without paying taxes, leading to a backlog that can take up to 15 years to process.",
    "Potential reforms to address these issues; the following reforms could be considered:",
    "Digitalisation: Implementing the full-scale digitalised Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) connected to Individual financial records could streamline processes and close existing loopholes.",
    "Training and development: Investing in training for IRD officials, especially in digital systems, could help modernise the department and improve efficiency.",
    "Legal reforms: Amending the legal framework to reduce the number of appeals without tax payment and speeding up the processing time could significantly improve revenue collection.",

    "Regulatory compliance: Digitisation often requires changes in regulations to support new processes and data formats.",
    "Cybersecurity: Protecting sensitive tax data is paramount, and robust cybersecurity measures are essential in a digital tax system.",
    "E-Invoicing: Many countries are adopting e-invoicing to improve indirect tax processes and reduce fraud.",
    "Cashless payments: Many countries are encouraging cashless payment methods for businesses that help to track accurate revenue collection.",
    "Data analytics: Tax authorities are using data analytics to gain insights into taxpayer behavior and identify potential areas of non-compliance.",
    "International cooperation: Digitalisation facilitates better international cooperation in tax matters, helping to address challenges posed by the digital economy.",
