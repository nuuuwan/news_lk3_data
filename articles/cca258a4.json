  "original_body_lines": [
    "A standoff is brewing between Sri Lanka\u2019s monetary authority and bond market participants, as cash-rich banks show a reluctant appetite for government securities. This was evident in the September 11, 2025 Treasury bond auction, where the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raised only a portion of its targeted funds, with a significant shortfall in a key maturity.",
    "This caution exists alongside signs of economic resilience. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew 6.4% year-on-year in July 2025, driven by surges in petroleum refining (166.7%), apparel manufacturing (16.2%), and non-metallic mineral products (15.9%).",
    "Amid this growth, the banking sector is flush with cash. Total outstanding market liquidity swelled to a surplus of Rs. 178.58 billion by September 12, 2025. However, this liquidity is not flowing aggressively into government bonds.",
    "The recent auction highlights this selective appetite. While the CBSL aimed to raise LKR 155.0 billion across three bonds, the largest offering \u2013 a LKR 85.0 billion 2030 maturity bond \u2013 attracted only LKR 46.2 billion (54.4% of its target). The two smaller bonds were fully subscribed.",
    "A market analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that healthy oversubscription rates show bidding interest exists, but a \u2018standoff\u2019 has emerged.",
    "\u201cThe Central Bank appears unwilling to accept the higher yields investors are demanding for certain maturities,\u201d he said.",
    "And he went on to explain factors for the banks\u2019 hesitation:",
    "Banks may be waiting for better yields to lock in their cash amid inflation is projected to accelerate towards 5% by mid-2026. They may be thinking real returns on current bonds are less attractive.",
    "The economic outlook remains tied to external demand and global uncertainties, like recent U.S. tariffs.",
    "The rupee has depreciated 3.1% against the dollar year-to-date, introducing currency risk for investors.",
    "This impasse presents a challenge. While the financial system has the capacity to support economic expansion, the government needs to fund its operations. Banks seem to be betting on more attractive future terms, while the government is reluctant to pay a premium\u201d.",
    "The analyst concluded: \u201cResolution will require either yield adjustments that satisfy market expectations or a significant shift in economic fundamentals. The coming weeks will determine if this is a temporary mismatch or a persistent challenge for Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery.\u201d",
