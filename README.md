The ceasefire between Israel and LebanonтАЩs Hezbollah militants began early Wednesday as a region on edge wondered whether it will hold.

The ceasefire announced Tuesday is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

There were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce, and there were signs of celebration in Beirut. But Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the agreement.

The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance.

### CBSL introduces Overnight Policy Rate; further eases monetary policy stance

The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to further ease the monetary policy stance and set the newly introduced Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 8.00 per cent.

With this change, the effective reduction in the policy interest rate would be around 50 basis points from the current level of the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which continues to serve as the operating target of the Flexible Inflation Targeting ( FIT) framework, the central bank said.

The Board arrived at the decision, at its meeting held on 26 November 2024, to ease the monetary policy stance following a comprehensive assessment of current and expected domestic and international economic developments, including risks and uncertainties, to ensure that inflation treads towards the inflation target of 5 per cent, while supporting the economy to reach its full capacity, it said.

тАЬAdministration is one thing and trade union demands are another,тАЭ he said responding to a question raised at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said there is no direct connection between the trade unionтАЩs demand and the Board of Directors or the decision-makers.

### Poverty of CBSLтАЩs monetary policies: Part II

High domestic interest rates on Government debt, combined with the absence of Central Bank intervention to purchase newly issued debt, will escalate the domestic debt servicing burden

The present article expands on the loss of control by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) of interest rates that we developed in Part I. In Part I the focus was money market or short-term interest rates. In the present article the focus is long-term interest rates, particularly interest rates on long-term Government debt.

The article makes two key points in this regard. Firstly, the CBSL has not only lost control over money market or short-term interest rates, as argued in Part I, but also over long-term interest rates, specifically those on long-term Government debt i.e., on Government debt exceeding one year. Secondly, this loss of control stems partly from the CBSLтАЩs inability to regulate short-term money market rates and partly from the provisions of the new Central Bank Act (CBA) passed in 2023.

### Blunder by new Government: No fertiliser to paddy farmers

The current GovernmentтАЩs biggest blunder is the neglect of fertiliser to paddy farmers

Over the past few weeks, TV channel тАШDeranaтАЩ reported on a number of occasions, the plight of the paddy farmers in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Amparai districts due to non-availability of fertiliser for their paddy cultivation. But the Government TV channels were silent over the issue.

Maha rainy season started in early October as usual and will continue until early January. Rains start in early October during the evenings and intensity will increase reaching a maximum in December and rains will end in early January, allowing the farmers to harvest from late January onwards.

The paddy farmers prepare fields after first rains having softened the grounds, mostly with tractors. With increase in rains, fields become muddy and are prepared for sowing of seed paddy generally in early November.

The symbolic exclusion signalled by the missing Muslim at the highest level of governance is significant and no amount of patronising rhetoric about our collective Sri Lankanness is going to address this sense of exclusion

The change that the new election has brought to the country is unprecedented. We have a woman Prime Minister (that many of us in the academic and activist communities know) and we have several young women in Parliament. Historically, since independence, we have only had 5% representation at any given moment. Now we have close to 10%. And that too through elections and only one through the national list.

### Cabinet nod to present Interim Budget for first four months  of 2025

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the formulation of an Interim Budget to cover the GovernmentтАЩs expenses during the first four months of 2025.

It will focus on relevant expenses for Government recurrent and capital expenses, public debt servicing, and loan restructuring.

The move comes as the new Parliament which convened on 21 November lacked sufficient time to complete the constitutional steps required for passing the full Appropriation Bill for 2025.

Therefore, as stipulated in sub-section 23(1) of the Public Finance Management Act No 44 of 2024, an interim Budget should be submitted to Parliament to allocate provisions for the continuation of currently implemented projects and public services for the first 4 months of 2025.

The proposal to this effect presented by the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the Inauguration of the First Session of the Tenth Parliament delivering a speech, said that the NPP government must go with the IMF framework and the previous administrationтАЩs debt restructuring agreements as they have been endorsed by the IMF. It is true. Renegotiating for a new Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) is now dead. That is good, because we must end this process as early as possible to enter a new beginning. If the Net Present Value analysis proves beneficial for us to ensure debt sustainability even under the macro-linked bond mechanism we must finish this process. The NPP government is going to do it possibly by the end of December this year. It is a great consolation.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs central bank will announce a single overnight policy rate from November 27, instead of the current policy corridor involving standing deposit facilities, the monetary authority said.

The standing lending and deposit facilities, will remain as a margin to the announced overnight policy rate.

The central bank will continue to target an average call money rate with liquidity operations.

Critics have warned that the denial monetary stability, especially from 2015, which led to serial currency crises, borrowing to repay debt, borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum for current transactions, was a consequence of excess money printed to target a mid-corridor rate (a de facto single policy rate).

Sri Lanka has been running broadly deflationary policy from around September 2022, withdrawing liquidity through outright transactions, but concerns have been raised at initial inflationary policy through its overnight and term operations.

*2024-11-26 20:51:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/gsp-can-it-drive-inclusive-growth-in-sri-lanka/) ┬╖ `en`

In a mid-October 2024 meeting with the European Union (EU) Ambassador, Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening trade relations with the EU, particularly highlighting the role of the GSP+ programme in boosting Sri Lankan exports. This discussion underscores the significance of the GSP+, which offers tariff preferences for Sri LankaтАЩs exports to the EU. The GSP+ offers reduced tariffs on exports, conditional upon the recipient countries implementing 27 international conventions. These conventions include standards on labour and human rights, environmental sustainability, and good governance. Sri LankaтАЩs major exports to the EU, such as wearing apparel, employ low and medium-skilled, and female workers, as well as estate and rural sector workers, directing benefits of GSP+ to vulnerable communities.
