    "\u201cThe budget presented this year has laid the groundwork for growth across various sectors of the economy. To foster economic growth, it is imperative to restore the country to the pre-crisis economic levels. The groundwork for this resurgence was established in the previous budget. The current year\u2019s budget is designed to further fortify economic stability and the progress in achieving this stability can be verified by scrutinizing data provided by the Central Bank.",
    "\u201cDuring the presentation of the 2023 budget, the nation found itself in a precarious situation, unable to produce a comprehensive budget document. At that critical juncture, the country grappled with profound economic downturn and political-social turbulence, marking a significant crossroads in its history.",
    "\u201cIt is noteworthy to acknowledge that the attained economic stability is a direct outcome of the 2023 budget document. Additionally, the government anticipates a 1.8% economic growth for the upcoming year, with aspirations to surpass that target and achieve a growth rate of 2% or more. The formulation of this year\u2019s budget took into account agreements established with the International Monetary Fund and the nation\u2019s creditors. Of particular significance is the commitment to achieving debt sustainability, thereby emphasizing meticulous attention to debt restructuring and various other considerations in the preparation of the budget proposals.",
    "\u201cThe government has prioritized addressing the challenges faced by population groups severely affected by the on-going economic crisis. Special consideration has been given to public servants, who have not seen a salary increase in many years. Consequently, the government has taken the initiative to grant an additional allowance of Rs. 10,000.",
    "\u201cFurthermore, focused attention has been extended to various vulnerable groups, including low-income earners, kidney patients, individuals receiving disability allowances and those receiving elderly allowances. This comprehensive approach is expected to benefit approximately 3 million families.",
    "\u201cAs per the economic crisis, small and medium-sized businesses, which faced significant challenges, have been a focal point. The current budget allocates over Rs. 30 billion for their rehabilitation. A structured system has been devised to facilitate their access to credit facilities, offering subsidized interest rates in the single-digit range. Furthermore, the government has lifted restrictions on imports, excluding personal-use vehicles, in a move aimed at fostering greater economic flexibility and adaptability.\u201d",

Notably, the daily income of Sri Lanka Customs has currently reached an impressive Rs. 5 billion.
