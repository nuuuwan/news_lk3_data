    "A political economy analysis of the food environment further underscored the rising prevalence of NCDs and the triple burden of malnutrition in Sri Lanka. The study highlighted the significant role of the food environment in addressing these challenges and provided recommendations for policy development. These recommendations included prioritising NCDs and nutrition, ensuring comprehensive policy coverage, fostering stakeholder participation, and addressing technical and legal considerations. Further, a presentation based on findings from a case study on the impact of the food environment on NCD risk factors in underserved settlements in Colombo discussed issues related to COVID-19, inflation, and compromised food choices. The study pointed out declining cooked food sales, compromised meals due to rising prices, reduced purchasing power, affordability concerns, unregulated prices, and unhealthy food choices. The participants highlighted the need for more nuanced policies targeting the food environment in urban underserved settlements.",
