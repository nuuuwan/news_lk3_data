    "National Board of SOS Children\u2019s Villages Sri Lanka President Nandasiri Ponnamperuma was recently elected to the newly formed International Board of SOS Children\u2019s Villages. Ponnamperuma\u2019s appointment was made official during the 23rd Ordinary General Assembly of SOS Children\u2019s Villages International, held recently in Vienna, Austria.",
    "The International Board\u2019s 13 newly elected members, all of whom volunteered for the position, replace the former International Senate. Selected from among 138 member associations worldwide to serve on the newly formed International Board, Ponnamperuma will represent the Asian region alongside a second representative from Nepal. His appointment reflects SOS Children\u2019s Villages Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to advancing child rights and protection on a broader scale. Ponnamperuma\u2019s appointment will contribute to ensuring long-term sustainability and accountability, overseeing executive leadership, and guiding future planning for the organisation.",
    "Bringing together delegates from SOS Children\u2019s Villages\u2019 member associations worldwide, the event highlighted potential reforms to ensure no child grows up alone. The Board comprises two representatives from each of the six global regions. Additionally, there is another appointed member from Austria in honour of the organisation\u2019s founding legacy. As the first International Board, it will serve as the organisation\u2019s supervisory body, guiding its global mission to protect lives worldwide. In that capacity, it will assist the General Assembly in implementing strategic oversight and cross-border collaboration to support every child and young person without parental care or at risk of losing it in 138 countries and member associations.",
    "Discussing the appointment, Ponnamperuma said, \u201cIt is a great privilege for me to have been elected to the International Board of SOS Children\u2019s Villages. SOS Children\u2019s Villages Sri Lanka has transformed thousands of young lives. It has not only given children without parental care a safe home and education, but also the love and emotional support they deserve. As I step into this new role, my vision is to strengthen our global efforts so that every child, everywhere, can grow up with love, security, and hope for a brighter future. I invite everyone to continue supporting this noble mission and to encourage others to join us in making a lasting difference in the lives of children.\u201d",
    "Speaking about the achievement, SOS Children\u2019s Villages Sri Lanka National Director Divakar Ratnadurai added, \u201cThis is a proud and significant milestone for SOS Children\u2019s Villages Sri Lanka and Asia. Ponnamperuma\u2019s election brings our national commitment to the global stage and reinforces our shared vision of a world where every child grows up in a loving family environment.\u201d"
