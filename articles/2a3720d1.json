  "original_body_lines": [
    "Tehran and Washington signalled a possible softening in nuclear tensions on Wednesday (Sep 24), with Iran insisting it has no ambitions to build nuclear weapons and the US expressing readiness to resume talks aimed at resolving the long-standing standoff.",
    "A few hours after Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told the UN General Assembly that Iran will never seek to build a nuclear bomb, US President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said \u201cwe have no desire to hurt them\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them. And why wouldn\u2019t we? We talk to everybody. As well we should. That\u2019s the job. Our job is to solve things,\u201d he told the Concordia summit in New York.",
    "Prior to a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, Tehran and Washington held five rounds of nuclear talks but faced major stumbling blocks such as uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, which Western powers want to bring down to zero to minimise any risk of weaponisation.",
    "Tehran accuses Washington of \u201cbetraying diplomacy\u201d, and the nuclear talks have stopped since the war.",
    "One Iranian insider told Reuters that \u201cseveral messages have been conveyed to Washington for resumption of talks via mediators in the past weeks, but Americans have not responded\u201d.",
    "On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on key state matters such as foreign policy and Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, ruled out negotiations with the United States under threat.",
    "The United States, its European allies and Israel accuse Tehran of using its nuclear programme as a veil for efforts to try to develop the capability to produce weapons. Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.",
    "Britain, France and Germany on Aug 28 launched a 30-day process to reimpose UN sanctions, known as snapback, that ends on Sep 27, accusing Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers aimed at preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon.",
    "The European powers have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months to allow space for talks on a long-term deal if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engages in talks with the United States.",
    "\u201cI think we have a desire, however, to either realise a permanent solution and negotiate around snapbacks, and if we can\u2019t, then snapbacks will be what they are. They\u2019re the right medicine for what\u2019s happening,\u201d Witkoff said.",
    "But amid the looming threat of sanctions and last-ditch talks between Tehran and European powers to reach a deal to avert snapback of sanctions, diplomats have warned that the chances of success remain slim.",
    "After meeting his Iranian counterpart on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, French President Emmanuel Macron said Iran still had a chance to prevent reimposition of international sanctions, adding that Tehran had not offered anything tangible.",
    "\u201cAn agreement is still possible. There are only a few hours left. It is up to Iran to meet the legitimate conditions we have set,\u201d Macron posted on X.",
    "Two European diplomats told Reuters that Iran, the E3 and the EU held a fresh round of talks on Wednesday.",
    "If Tehran and the E3 fail to reach a deal on an extension by the end of Sep 27, then all UN sanctions will be reimposed on Iran, where the economy already struggles with crippling sanctions reimposed since 2018 after Trump ditched the pact during his first term.",
    "The so-called snapback process would reimpose an arms embargo, a ban on uranium enrichment and reprocessing, a ban on activities with ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, a global asset freeze and travel bans on Iranian individuals and entities."
