    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said although all political parties in Parliament are united, none of them currently possess a 50% voter base.",
    "He emphasized the need for unity among the parties, not solely for the purpose of elections, but to steer the country towards recovery from the ongoing economic crisis.",
    "The President also highlighted the loss of faith in elections and politics among the majority of the population, including the youth.",
    "During his address at the \"2023/2024 National Law Conference\" held at the Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya, President Wickremesinghe further emphasized that while the re-establishment of law and order, as well as political and economic stability, is crucial, it does not imply that Sri Lanka has completely overcome the crisis. He emphasized the necessity of making significant commitments in the future to ensure the success of the entire process.",
    "Reflecting on the economic challenges faced by the country ten months ago, the President mentioned that it was an unprecedented situation in history. He acknowledged the efforts made by him and his team to alleviate the crisis during that time.",
    "\"Regrettably, the majority of our people have lost faith in elections and politics. Whether it is the Parliament, the judiciary, the media, private sector trade unions, or professionals, a vast number of citizens lack trust in the entire system that governs our nation,\u201d the President said."
