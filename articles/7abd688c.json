    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Friday stated that if the current Government fails to meet the expectations set by the people in the recent mandate, it could lead to citizens losing hope in envisioning a prosperous future.",
    "He emphasised that Government officials must dedicate themselves to building a Government that fulfils the aspirations of the people.",
    "President Dissanayake made these remarks while addressing the staff of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, after officially assuming duties as its Minister.",
    "Upon his arrival at the Ministry, the President was warmly welcomed by the staff.",
    "He expressed heartfelt appreciation for the contributions made by the Ministry\u2019s officials in navigating the country through the recent economic crisis. The President also emphasised the importance of continued collective effort, stating that everyone\u2019s support would be essential in achieving future successes.",
    "President Dissanayake further stated that while the country has a history of judging Government officials based on preconceived notions during political transitions, moving forward, their contributions will be the sole benchmark for evaluation. He assured that if any unfair treatment or undue obstacles arise in the course of their duties, he would stand firmly in their defence.",
    "He also acknowledged the public\u2019s lack of trust in revenue-generating departments and admitted that changing this perception would be challenging. However, he emphasised that under the new Government, all officials now have the opportunity to rectify any negative impressions and rebuild public confidence in their roles.",
