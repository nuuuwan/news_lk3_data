    "99x is pleased to announce the launch of OptimaxerAI Web, an innovative platform designed to run AI directly in the browser. This cutting-edge solution is the latest addition to 99x\u2019s AI product family, OptimaxerAI, and is set to revolutionise how users leverage artificial intelligence with its powerful and flexible capabilities for various use cases.",
    "Commenting on this revolutionary launch, Hasith Yaggahavita, CEO of 99x, said, \u201cWe are delighted to introduce OptimaxerAI Web as a significant milestone in our OptimaxerAI journey at 99x Labs. When we founded 99x Labs, our mission was to demystify emerging technologies and make them easily accessible to our customers. We discovered that some of our customers were hesitant to expose their production data to service providers like OpenAI, making large language model (LLM) platforms an impractical option. This led us to research how to run small language models locally, within the browser and on their data centres. We have designed a set of fine-tuned AI modules that can be integrated into existing products in a matter of hours, delivering substantial value.\u201d",
    "Samudra Kanankearachchi, Head of 99x Labs and the mastermind behind the project, shared his enthusiasm for the new technology, saying, \u201cWe see numerous areas where OptimaxerAI Web components can augment the user experience. For example, one of the OptimaxerAI Web agents enables task augmentation through AI co-pilots. In a sales application, users can accomplish tasks using natural language to navigate the user interface. These co-pilots understand the user\u2019s intent and present the relevant interface elements to complete the operation.\u201d",
