    "Israel has been suppressing the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people for decades, enabled by the support of Western democracies",
    "The ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people by the Zionist state of Israel has resulted in the killing of more than 12,000 people, mostly women and children. It is also targeting journalists who are vital in relaying the ground situation in Gaza. Israel, through a deadly blockade, is depriving millions of people living in Gaza of food, water, electricity, and fuel. This is defined as collective punishment under international law \u2013 a war crime. It is carrying out daily bombardments, including of hospitals, homes, schools, refugee camps, and ambulances.",
    "The Netanyahu-led Zionist Israeli Government has blatantly stated its genocidal intent. Despite the passing of a non-binding resolution calling for a ceasefire at the UN General Assembly, Israel continues to violate international law. The US, UK and other imperialist powers, continue to support Israel through funding and weapons, and provide cover for war crimes. The countries like India, China, Russia and US are playing a mischievous role and extending their passive support to Israel in order to meet their own sinister motives. It would not have been this easy for Israel to commit such a heinous crime, in the presence of the world socialist camp, which existed earlier.",
    "Israel has been suppressing the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people for decades, enabled by the support of Western democracies. Meanwhile, Gaza has been described as the largest open-air prison in the world, where 2.2 million Palestinians are being held hostage.",
    "The student community stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine. People around the world have condemned Israeli brutality, and it is time to unite the anti-imperialist, peace loving people across the globe. We call on you all, to come forward to resist the fascist Israeli Government and their allies, and protect Palestinian lives.",
    "We, as student unions from across South Asia, call for an immediate ceasefire, the lifting of the blockade, and for humanitarian assistance, including fuel, to enter Gaza. We call on Governments and the media, particularly in the West, to stop supporting the dehumanisation and genocide of the Palestinian people.",
    "We recognise the right of the Palestinian people to resist, return home, and to be free.",
