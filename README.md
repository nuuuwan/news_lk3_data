### කෑම මිල අඩු කරන්නේ නැද්ද ?

*2024-09-28 16:48:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/201635) · `si`

ගෑස්, බිත්තර, සහ අනෙකුත් අමුද්‍රව්‍ය මිල සැලකිය යුතු ලෙස  පහළ ගොස් තිබියදීත් කෙටි ආහාර ඇතුළු අනෙකුත් ආහාර වර්ගවල මිල ගණන් පහළ නොයාම විශාල ගැටලුවක් බව පාරිභෝගිකයින් පවසයි.

ඔවුන් චෝදනා කරන්නේ, වෙළෙඳුන් ලාභ ඉපැයීම පමණක් අරමුණු කරගනිමින් පාරිභෝගිකයා පීඩාවට පත්කරන බවය.

පසුගිය සමයේ රට මුහුණ දුන් ආර්ථික අර්බුදයත් සමග ආහාර නිෂ්පාදනයට අවශ්‍ය කෙරෙන බිත්තර, තිරිඟු පිටි ඇතුළු අමුද්‍රව්‍ය මෙන්ම ගෑස් ඉන්ධන වැනි භාණ්ඩ රැසක මිල ඉහළ ගියේය.

ඒ සමග තම නිෂ්පාදනවල මිල ඉහළ දැමීමට ආහාර නිෂ්පාදකයන් හා වෙළඳුන් පියවර ගත් අතර සුපුරුදු පරිදි එහි බර ද දැරීමට සිදුවූයේ මෙරට පාරිභෝගික ජනතාවටය.

කෙසේ වෙතත්, ගෑස්, තිරිඟු පිටි පමණක් නොව බිත්තර මිලද අද වනවිට සැලකිය යුතු ලෙස පහළ ගොස් තිබේ.

පාරිභෝගිකයින් චෝදනා කරන්නේ, ආහාර මිල ගණන් පහළ නොදැමීමට වෙළෙඳුන් පියවර නොගන්නේ ඒ වෙනුවෙන් බලපෑමක් කිරීමට බලධාරීන්ගේ අවධානය යොමුනොවීම නිසා බවය.

### ශ්‍රී ලංකා රග්බි පොඩ්ඩෝ ආසියානු ශූරතාවයේ කඩඉමක් අබියස

මැලේසියාවේ දී අද (28) ආරම්භ වූ ආසියානු වයස 18න් පහළ සත්සාමාජික රග්බි තරගාවලියේ අවසන් මහා තරගය පෙනෙන මානය දක්වා ඉදිරියට යාමට ශ්‍රී ලංකා පිරිමි කණ්ඩායම සමත් විය.

තරග ආරම්භ කරමින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ක්‍රීඩාකළ පළමු තරගයෙන් තායිලන්තය ලකුණු 27-0ක් ලෙසින් පහසුවෙන් පරාජය කළේය.

ඉන් අනතුරුව ඔවුන් මුහුණ දුන් දෙවැනි තරගයෙන් චීන තායිපේ කණ්ඩායම ලකුණු 29-7ක් ලෙස පරාජය කිරීමට සමත් විය.

එමෙන්ම අතිශය තීරණාත්මක තරගය වූ ප්‍රබල හොංකොං රාජ්‍යයට එරෙහි තරගයද ලකුණු 17-17ක් ලෙසින් සම තත්ත්වයෙන් අවසන් කිරීමට ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට හැකිවිය.

ඒ අනුව ශ්‍රී ලංකාව හෙට (29) දිනයේදී එක් තරගයකට පමණක් ක්‍රීඩාකිරීමට ඉතිරිව ඇති වුවත්, එම තරගය නිතරග අවස්ථාවක් (BYE) වී ඇත.

මෙම තරගාවලිය 'ඒ' හා 'බී' ලෙස කණ්ඩායම් 9ක සහභාගිත්වයෙන් පැවැත්වේ.

එහි ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ක්‍රීඩාකරන 'බී' කාණ්ඩයට රටවල් 04ක් පමණක් ඇතුළත්ව ඇති නිසා එම කාණ්ඩයේ සෑම රටකටම නිතරග අවස්ථාවක් හිමිව ඇත.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව සමගින් 'බී' කාණ්ඩයෙන් හොංකොං, චීන තායිපේ හා තායිලන්තය ක්‍රීඩාකරනු ලබයි.

'බී' කාණ්ඩයේ මේ දක්වා පැවති තරග අනුව ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ප්‍රසාද ලකුණු සටහනේ පෙරමුණ හිමිකරගෙන සිටියි.

Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of 8.25 per cent and 9.25 per cent, respectively.

The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on September 26, 2024, after carefully considering the recent and expected macroeconomic developments and possible risks and uncertainties on the domestic and global fronts with a view to ensuring that inflation aligns with the target of 5 per cent over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach its maximum potential, a CBSL statement said.

The Board observed that inflation is likely to remain well below the target of 5 per cent over the next few quarters, potentially recording deflation in the immediate future driven by changes to administratively determined prices and easing of supply conditions, the Central Bank said.

### Role of history and ideology in shaping China’s geopolitical strategies and influence on Sri Lanka

Dr. Patrick Mendis and Dr. Antonina Łuszczykiewicz-Mendis offer an in-depth analysis of China’s ‘Dragon and Phoenix’ strategy, highlighting how Beijing blends assertive geopolitical moves with culturally-driven diplomacy to expand its global influence. They discuss how this dual approach is shaping the ongoing US-China rivalry, particularly in the strategic Indian Ocean region, and its potential implications for Sri Lanka.

Q:  In your article on China’s ‘Dragon and Phoenix’ strategy, you describe the ‘Dragon’ as representing China’s more assertive, forceful actions, while the ‘Phoenix’ symbolises its softer, culturally-focused diplomacy. Could you elaborate on how these two aspects work together to enhance China’s global influence?

Dr. Mendis: In our article, we aimed to capture how China perceives itself and projects its strategy to the world in a very subtle, often secretive manner. To effectively explain this, we chose to use a Chinese metaphor—the Dragon and Phoenix.

### Ratha Gaya: A national burden

*2024-09-28 00:40:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ratha-Gaya-A-national-burden/4-767267) · `en`

Given Sri Lanka’s current economic situation, it is imperative to re-evaluate our approach to vehicle ownership and usage

Ratha Gaya, a term often used to describe the obsession with owning flashy vehicles, has become a pervasive issue in Sri Lanka. This trend, fuelled by the perceived status and the inadequacy of public transportation, has placed an undue burden on the Government and the nation’s economy.

Government officials, often compensated with relatively lower salaries compared to their private sector counterparts, have traditionally been given duty-free vehicle allowances. This has led to a proliferation of vehicles within Government departments, often used more for personal convenience than for official duties. Similarly, the private sector has also succumbed to this trend, viewing vehicles as status symbols rather than mere utilities.

### UNP and its continuing suicidal saga

Congratulations on a brilliant editorial on 26 September which used the UNP and its extremely long time leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to highlight the destructive, disastrous and detrimental role he had played individually to the concept of social liberal politics and ideology in Sri Lanka.

You have brilliantly captured in words the reality and practical implications of Wickremesinghe’s role in weakening the pillars of social liberalism, firstly in the UNP and then in Sri Lankan politics.

His nurturing and sustaining the myth that he is eternal and thus creating personality cults within the UNP and every time he governed led to the building up of corruption, cronyism, poor governance, abuse of power, undermining the rule of law and undermining the parliamentary and judicial systems which violate the constitution of Sri Lanka.

We look forward to collaborating closely with you to strengthen the ties between our countries and promote mutual growth," said Sri Lanka Maldives Business Council President Sudesh Mendis.

While our export revenue has grown to $ 163 million in 2023, it has not kept pace with overall market growth, resulting in a decline in our market share in the Maldives, which now stands at 4.65%, down from approximately 7.02% eight years ago. This decline highlights the need for concerted efforts to enhance our presence in this vital market.

### The power of the cross and a crossover in power styles

The power of that cross must slowly but surely transform the nature, principles and practice of power in the land. Else it would be only a transactional double-cross fit for the dustbin of history – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In the run-up to the Presidential election of 2024, the then emerging aspirant for executive office Anura Kumara Dissanayake once waxed eloquent about “the power of the cross” (‘kathiraya’).

He intimated that it was not simply, deceptively, one person’s expressed preference for a particular individual; but rather, a powerful exercise of the franchise which could reap a wide-ranging harvest of repercussions.

Rest assured that those ramifications are being felt in nation, state, country, bureaucracy and beyond today. For better or for worse, only time will tell.

While Sri Lanka is commendably moving toward better governance, there remains room for substantial improvement. Enhancing our policy-making processes is critical for continuing this forward momentum. The proposed establishment of an External Policy Review Board (EPRB) offers a significant opportunity to deepen our commitment to transparent and effective governance.

The EPRB, as envisaged, would be comprised of 10 interdisciplinary experts, each bringing a depth of knowledge essential for the nuanced evaluation of Government policies. This board would operate as a confidential advisory body, providing independent reviews and recommendations directly to the President and policy framers. This structure is designed to ensure all Government and citizen-initiated policies undergo rigorous scrutiny, aligning with national and international standards.
