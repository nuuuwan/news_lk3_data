The Small and Medium Scale Rice Mill Owners’ Association stresses that the growing rice shortage in the market is caused by the increased use of raw rice for beer production.

According to the association, diverting more rice for brewing has impacted the availability of rice for consumers, leading to rising prices.

Chairman of the association U.K. Semasinghe explained that the raw rice used in beer production is sourced from ‘Nadu’ paddy.

“Raw rice is essential for beer production, but it comes from ‘Nadu’ paddy. When a greater portion of this paddy is allocated to the production of beer, the supply of paddy for regular Nadu rice production diminishes,” he noted.

Against this backdrop, farmers’ organizations have echoed similar concerns, urging the government to intervene and stabilize rice prices.

Many shopkeepers report difficulty in obtaining rice at the government-controlled price, further straining the market.

JR’s words from 1956 are a wake-up call for us today. As a politician who lost his parliamentary seat, where the powerful UNP was reduced to 8 seats by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s M.E.P and its wave of Sinhala nationalism, JR’s speech was a warning of the dangers of a powerful Government without strong opposition

The prerequisite of our political life is the alternation of political teams in office. Indeed, what we think of as “democracy” is intimately bound up with this system of alternation, as our main liberties coincide with those necessary for the “outs” to rally support and oust the “ins.”

The above writing by the French philosopher and author Bertrand de Jouvenel is quoted by JR in a speech titled “Role of the Opposition in a Parliamentary Democracy” on 7 September 1956, the year of the UNP’s most humiliating defeat to S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (M.E.P). The defeat of 2020 cannot be counted, as the SJB is ideologically the UNP by another name.

*2024-11-06 23:56:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Appreciation-Franklyn-Amerasinghe/4-768913) · `en`

This week, we mourn the passing of Franklyn Amerasinghe, who bravely faced a challenging battle with cancer. His patience and resilience in confronting such adversity imparted countless life lessons. Franklyn was a simple, down-to-earth person. As my mother’s brother, he inspired me to embrace challenges beyond my comfort zone.

As a keen follower of HR, I wish to honour and celebrate his immense contribution to HR development and the strengthening of industrial relations in the country. Franklyn was a man whose life exemplified unwavering dedication to fostering constructive workplace dialogue, championing alternative dispute resolution, HR development, and advocating for social justice for workers.

### Are rice consumers and farmers victims of current practices?

*2024-11-06 23:49:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Are-rice-consumers-and-farmers-victims-of-current-practices/4-768912) · `en`

The argument that Sri Lanka is self-sufficient in rice does not hold water. Therefore, since the current shortfalls have a bearing on market prices which in turn have a bearing on health, poverty and malnutrition, price variations should be avoided. It is therefore imperative that rice production be increased and stocks monitored regularly to ensure that sufficient stocks are available at any time because shortfalls are often the cause to justify increasing market prices

### Harini or Sajith: Who is more necessary, can contribute more?

‘“We aim to leave power only once we have successfully rebuilt this nation” Dissanayake pledged, addressing a rally in Nuwara Eliya…’

Throughout 2024 I consistently urged that the choice be either Sajith or Anura (or vice versa) -- and never Ranil-- to effect a generational tectonic-shift. Given the primary challenge of managing the economic crisis, I thought Sajith Premadasa would make a better President.

Noting that we have two national elections, the presidential and the parliamentary/prime ministerial, I observed that we can always accommodate both young leaders, one in each post.

At the Presidential election most Sri Lankan voters voted quite understandably with their heart and an Aragalaya attitude, for the greatest degree of change, the most progressive and radical they thought possible. A break with the Establishment, voting for Anura was a step forward.

### Coconut: The next ‘tea’ for Sri Lanka?

*2024-11-06 23:02:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Coconut-The-next-tea-for-Sri-Lanka/4-768909) · `en`

How the demand for value-added coconut products can catapult the industry as the number one export and foreign exchange generator for Sri Lanka, surpassing tea

Any traveller landing in Katunayake Airport during the day can’t help but notice and marvel at the lush greenery one sees especially the thick groves of coconut trees all along the beautiful beaches and the beautiful coastline from the sky. You would then easily believe that coconuts must be a key part of Sri Lankan people’s palette, livelihoods and contributor to the economy.

But the crop that has always been the biggest economic contributor, until now, is tea.

Tea is numero uno in Sri Lanka. The famed ‘Ceylon Tea’ fetches Sri Lanka nearly $ 1.3 billion and employs over a million people. Alongside garments, tourism and worker remittances, they form the base of Sri Lanka’s economy and provide the foreign currency needed to import many essentials, like fuel and medicine.

### Historic deflation in 29 years  and impact on business and people

*2024-11-06 22:54:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Historic-deflation-in-29-years-and-impact-on-business-and-people/14-768908) · `en`

In a striking economic turnaround, Sri Lanka has recorded its first deflation in 29 years, with the inflation rate dipping to -0.5% in September.

The Central Bank (CBSL) attributes this significant decline in general price levels to administrative price adjustments that brought down key cost drivers, including food, fuel, and revisions in water and electricity tariffs. According to the CPI, prices deflated for food and non-alcoholic beverages to -0.3%, while housing and utilities fell further to -8.4% from -6.8% in August. Although prices rebounded in other sectors such as footwear and clothing to 0.1% from -0.4% for instance, major reductions in electricity and water tariffs have lowered utility costs, driving down inflation.

### Getting rid of Blackheads…

*2024-11-06 22:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/getting-rid-of-blackheads/) · `en`

Who doesn’t like to have a clean and clear skin? But blackheads are a common type of skin condition that everyone usually faces at some point in their lives. Blackheads are a common skin condition that primarily affects the face, neck, back, and chest. There are several causes, including too much oil on your skin and irritation of your hair follicles.

Blackheads are most common in adolescents, but they can occur at any age, so this week I’ve worked on a remedy that should be of benefit to the readers of my column.

You will need 01 tablespoon of lemon juice and 01 tablespoon of egg white.

In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice and egg white. Whisk them together until well mixed and slightly frothy.

Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat it dry and apply the mask, using clean fingers, or a brush. Apply the mixture to areas with blackheads. Be careful to avoid your eyes.

Allow the mask to sit for about 15-20 minutes, or until you feel it’s dry.

Donald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad.

Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country.

The former president’s victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold. As of 5:45 a.m. ET (1045 GMT) Trump had won 279 electoral votes to Harris’ 223 with several states yet to be counted.

He also led Harris by about 5 million votes in the popular count.

“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.
