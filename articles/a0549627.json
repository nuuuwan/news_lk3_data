    "Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - The name 'spa' has to be changed and people should not be allowed to merely use the name spa, Tourism State Minister Diana Gamage said.",
    "Addressing the media, she said the use of the name 'spa' is not appropriate as it implies a high level of professionalism and denotes a wellness center. Therefore, it is imperative to cease using that name.",
    "\"The utilization of the name'spa' disrespects the professionalism of individuals working in such establishments. It is important to refrain from using this name to uphold the dignity and respect associated with the spa industry,\" she said.",
    "\"If a lady has to work as a masseur in a spa or in a hotel, and if she goes and says to someone that she is working in a spa, people look at her as if at a prostitute. Because the name spa is being used like that,\" the State Minister said.",
    "Therefore, the name 'spa' has to be changed and they should not be allowed to use the name spa, she said.",
    "When answering a question from a journalist over legalizing prostitution and the late-night bars going with prostitution, the State Minister said she does not agree with the late-night bars going with prostitution.",
    "\"I do not think that people have to drink to go with a prostitute. Prostitution is 24/7 and there is no set time for prostitution. That is the oldest profession in the world and no one can stop it. It happens if you like it or not,\" she said.",
    "\"Therefore, you people have to look at it in a realistic way and have to talk realistically. Because this is still happening in this country,\" she said."
