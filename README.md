ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s former Finance Minister N M Perera, who was a member of a Trotskyist party, has beaten the International Monetary Fund to impose property taxes on citizens decades ago, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has explained.

A property tax was implemented even when N.M. Perera was the Finance Minister, Siyambalapitiya said.

Perera was a member of Sri Lanka’s Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party and was in the cabinet of a 1970s administration that imposed severe exchange and import controls in a so-called ‘closed economy’.

Perera studied at the London School of Economics, under Harold Laski, a noted Marxist who tried to take UK’s Labour Party deeper even into the left.

In 1971 the US dollar collapsed against its specie anchor, taking the Bretton Woods with it after money was printed to target employment as doctrines involving unsound money that was widely taught widely at so-called ‘Saltwater’ universities.

India, the world’s biggest democracy, held Parliamentary elections this year in seven phases from 19 April to 1 June. 642 million persons voted in the poll. Results were announced on 4 June. The incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi was re-elected PM for the third time. His party the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 240 of 572 Lok Sabha or Parliament seats. Together with allied parties the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) obtained 293 seats in Parliament.

The election results have been continuously analysed and commented upon from the time of the poll. A significant aspect of these analyses and commentaries is the “caste factor”. Indian analysts and commentators are not “shy” about discussing caste openly when dissecting poll results. It is an acknowledged fact in India that caste plays a very influential role in determining the outcome of elections in many electorates, regions or states. Many Indians delve into the “caste in elections” topic without any inhibitions.

### Emerging Presidential election campaigns in Sri Lanka: Liberal consensus and fringe politics

In the lead up to Presidential elections, the three leading political camps—the President Ranil Wickremesinghe-led Government, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and the National People’s Power (NPP)—appear to converge on two key issues, namely, an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led path to economic recovery, and the continuity of the Provincial Councils (PC) system.

On the economic front, the current IMF program is now backed, to varying degrees, by all three camps. The SJB and the NPP, from the Opposition, argue that they would negotiate the Government’s IMF deal to more favourable terms that especially benefit the more vulnerable, poorer sections of society. This indicates one side of the policy convergence that ‘there is no alternative’ to the IMF.
