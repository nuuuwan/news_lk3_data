    "COLOMBO (News 1st) - Three Fundamental Rights petitions have been filed before the Supreme Court by 170 Chief Inspectors and Inspectors of Police, challenging recent promotions to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP).The petitioners are seeking a court ruling that their fundamental rights were violated by the recent promotion of 45 officers who sat for the competitive examination for the post of Assistant Superintendent of Police.\u00a0The IGP, the promoted officers, and members of the National Police Commission have been named as respondents.\u00a0Filed by Attorney-at-Law Manjula Balasuriya, the petitions claim that the examination was marred with irregularities, including reports of a leaked question paper and delayed release of results.The petitioners argue that, unlike previous cases where promotions were based on seniority, this examination considered only academic qualifications, ignoring professional experience.\u00a0They claim these actions violated their fundamental rights and have requested the court to invalidate the examination results."
