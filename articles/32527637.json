    "I stand here in the legacy of Mrs Susan George Pulimood \u2014 a visionary principal, botanist and educationist, who pioneered science education for girls at Visakha Vidyalaya in 1946. It is no exaggeration to say that her bold leadership seeded the success of generations of Visakhians in medicine, science, and engineering. As a paediatric surgeon, I am proud to reflect that her vision lives on in research labs and leadership roles around the world through countless Visakhians.",
    "Paediatrics is the care of children. Surgery is the art and science of operative healing. Paediatric surgery is where these two vocations meet \u2014 requiring not only technical mastery but the ability to care for the most vulnerable: those who cannot speak for themselves. Children are not miniature adults. They differ vastly in anatomy, physiology, and pathology. From premature babies the size of a small syringe to robust teenagers \u2014 each child presents unique challenges and risks. Nowadays babies survive at 23 weeks\u2019 gestation bringing on a unique set of surgical problems that paediatric surgeons are called upon to manage. Many are critically ill, and often the first sign of distress is silence, not complaint. On the other hand an obese child at age 15 brings on another set of surgical problems needing our attention. The two cannot be treated equally.",
    "As a paediatric surgeon, I care not just for the child but for their entire family \u2014 stressed parents, anxious grandparents, tearful siblings \u2014 all look to you for hope and clarity. You become not just a surgeon, but a communicator, counsellor, and anchor.",
    "To offer a glimpse into the daily realities of paediatric surgery, let me share a case of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal condition that affects premature infants. These babies, sometimes born less than 34 weeks and weighing less than 500 grams, have immature organs and minimal physiological reserves. In NEC, parts of the intestine lose blood supply and begin to die, eventually leading to perforation.",
    "Emergency surgery is often the only life-saving option. The tiniest of incisions, the softest of sutures, and the calmest of hands are required to handle such fragile patients. Every second counts, and each surgical move must be deliberate and thoughtful. Following these procedures babies need intensive care treatment for number of months including artificial ventilation, artificial nutrition and intensive medical management. Surgery is only a small proportion of their care.",
    "Becoming a paediatric surgeon requires rigorous training \u2014 over a decade of study after medical school. That includes three to four years in Sri Lanka and further training overseas for about two years in a centre of excellence. I was fortunate to be the first postgraduate paediatric surgeon trained through the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine of the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Later, international training in Australia further shaped my skillset. I served in the Lady Ridgeway Children\u2019s Hospital Colombo on my return and immigrated to New Zealand later. I have given back by helping over 30 Sri Lankan postgraduates access specialist training in New Zealand. I have also trained over 50 surgeons at different phases of their career in New Zealand.",
    "Surgical training is intense. You learn through long hours, high stakes, and continuous reflection. The steepest learning curve often lies not in technique, but in humility \u2014 recognizing that despite our best efforts, outcomes are not always in our control.",
    "The surgical space is a dynamic, high-risk environment where hazards lurk in every corner for every patient. The invasive procedures cause physiological challenges to patients. Every decision, every action, every word matters. One lapse or error in judgment can magnify to epic proportions leading to irreversible consequences. There is no margin for error. It is a space that demands mental sharpness, physical precision, and emotional stability. And yet, it is also a space of \u201cflow\u201d \u2014 where surgeons, anaesthetists and everyone in the team become so deeply immersed towards a common goal physically, mentally and intellectually that time disappears and the only thing that matters is the well-being of the patient.",
    "Success in surgery goes far beyond technical skill. The technical skill is one of ten competencies expected of a surgeon. You must communicate clearly, adapt rapidly, lead compassionately, and remain calm under pressure. You must also be a team player, teacher, a mentor, and a scholarly contributor to the profession. The cultural competence is a new concept introduced by many surgical colleges all over the world.",
    "A surgeon\u2019s responsibilities extend beyond clinical care. As a teacher, you pass down your craft. Every move, every incision, every suture becomes a teaching moment. As a researcher, you challenge the status quo, contribute to evidence-based practice and guide your juniors for life-long learning. As a member of regulatory bodies and professional associations, you shape the ethical and operational standards of your profession. The professionals need to be governed by professionals while keeping the focus on the safety and welfare of the unsuspecting public. The professional and regulatory bodies should have a formal complaint process to investigate issues raised by the public without using social media as an outlet.",
    "Community engagement and volunteering is also vital. Many surgeons participate in these projects in under-privileged countries. I have participated in humanitarian work including Sri Lanka\u2019s first renal transplant, tsunami relief, and regular donations of surgical consumables to Karapitiya Hospital and using my professional networks to arrange specialist training for Sri Lankan postgraduates. Volunteering is not a side hobby \u2014 it is an ethical obligation for those privileged to serve.",
    "Surgery is a team sport. Behind every successful operation stands a hive of professionals \u2014 surgeons, surgical trainees, anaesthetists and their trainees, nurses, technicians, laboratory staff, radiology staff, healthcare assistants, and more. It is a busy hive. Each has a specific role. Each is essential.",
    "Perhaps the most logistically and ethically complex of my career \u2014 the separation of pygopagus conjoint twins demonstrated an epic example of teamwork. Joined at the pelvis, the twins shared bone, nerves, and internal organs such as the rectum and urogenital structures. The surgery, which lasted 22 continuous hours and involved 55 professionals, demanded not only surgical precision but months of preoperative planning, team simulations, anatomical mapping, and psychological preparation of the family.",
    "Each medical team \u2014 paediatric surgery, orthopaedics, plastics, neurosurgery, anaesthetics \u2014 prepared and executed their part with precision and discipline. The supporting staff nursing, laboratory, radiology, technical and healthcare assistants did their part effectively. The success was not individual but collective \u2014 a true testament to the power of coordinated, collaborative care. These cases reaffirm the power of meticulous preparation, team coordination, and compassionate care. They demonstrate why paediatric surgery is as much about skill as it is about empathy and collaboration. Seeing the twins thrive postoperatively has been one of the most profound experiences of my career. They celebrated their 21st birthday this year.",
    "Let me now turn to a crucial issue: gender equity in surgery. Globally, women now comprise more than 50% of medical graduates. Yet, only a fraction pursue surgical careers. In Sri Lanka, women make up just appalling 5% of surgeons \u2014 a shocking figure.",
    "The reasons are complex: cultural bias, lack of role models, unequal domestic responsibilities, and systemic barriers. But the consequences are clear \u2014 we are losing half the talent pool. Worse still, we are denying our patients the diverse perspectives and qualities that female surgeons bring.",
    "And it\u2019s not just about equity \u2014 it\u2019s about outcomes. A landmark study showed that patients of female surgeons have lower complication rates and mortality. Why? Because women often bring enhanced communication, greater empathy, and meticulous care \u2014 traits that matter immensely in healing.",
    "Despite being the only woman on many surgical teams, I have persevered \u2014 and I urge young women not to shy away from this demanding but deeply rewarding path. They say, \u201cTo be a surgeon you need to have fingers of a lady and heart of a lion\u201d. Why not find a lady with a heart of a lion. You do not have to choose between family and career. It is not easy \u2014 but it is possible.",
    "The College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka started a Women in Surgery Forum with three old Visakhians leading the charge in 2022. In 2019 too in Galle, we addressed women\u2019s issues in surgery at national academic sessions but because of the pandemic the intended program was delayed. Recently, we\u2019ve begun reaching out to medical faculties to encourage female students to take up surgery and kindle their interest at those formative years of their career. We have addressed female medical students in Galle faculty recently and will have another project in Jaffna soon.",
    "My college, The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons too has launched a women\u2019s forums to advocate and mentor the next generation. It is a good time to be a girl. The Sri Lankan women surgeons have created a WhatsApp group privately to support, uplift and share information. We are just 30 in number \u2014 but I am proud to say 10 of us are Visakhians. We must continue to grow our tribe. We need more girls in operating rooms, in leadership, and in surgical academia. If half the class is female, half the surgical field should be too.",
    "Surgery can be all-consuming. The stress becomes normalized and burnout is a real risk. That is why personal resilience and work-life balance are critical. I recharge through tennis, yoga, hiking, and choreographing stage productions. Thanks to Zoom, my yoga instructor is in Germany while I stretch in New Zealand. I produce cultural performances \u2014 from hospital revues to community shows with over 40 participants. These creative outlets keep me balanced and connected, something I once gave up in pursuit of academics.",
    "As senior surgeons, we have a duty to mentor. Our juniors watch our every move. The way we treat patients, the compassion we show, the respect we command \u2014 all become part of their learning. Leadership is not about hierarchy. It\u2019s about inspiration and service. As a clinical director and teacher, I have tried to walk that path \u2014 supporting juniors, advocating for better training, and making space for diverse voices. The happiness, satisfaction, fulfillment, sense of achievement, sense of purpose and meaning in life in the joy of healing particularly children is indescribable. If there was one profession where altruism is practiced in the exercise of day-to-day function it is medicine and surgery. Giving is a powerful element of wellbeing.",
    "To the young women in the audience \u2014 whether you choose medicine, law, engineering, business or the arts \u2014 my message is this: There is no glass ceiling that cannot be cracked. The sky is the limit. Be proud, humble and resilient \u2014 but never arrogant. Let your work speak for itself.",
    "Mrs Pulimood once said, \u201cScience is the pursuit of truth.\u201d That truth still lights our path. To Visakha Vidyalaya, to my mentors, to my teachers at Visakha, to my university teachers, to my colleagues, students, friends and family \u2014 thank you for shaping my journey. To the children I have cared for \u2014 thank you for trusting me. And to the future surgeons, scientists and leaders among you \u2014 I say: step forward. The world needs you.",
