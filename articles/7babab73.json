  "original_body_lines": [
    "Brazil requested consultations at the World Trade Organization over tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump against the South American nation that went into effect on Wednesday.",
    "Trump has directly tied the 50% tariff on many imported Brazilian goods to the judicial situation of his embattled ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest.",
    "\u201cThe United States has flagrantly violated key commitments the country has agreed upon at the WTO, such as the principle of the most favored nation and tariff ceilings negotiated at that organization,\u201d Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement.",
    "The most favored nation principle is a cornerstone of Geneva-based WTO, whose aim is to get countries to respect trade agreements. The principle directs its members to treat each other equally in trade. WTO panels are set if no agreement is reached in disputes between members.",
    "\u201cBrazil\u2019s government reiterates its availability for negotiation and hopes these consultations contribute to a solution to the matter,\u201d the Brazilian foreign office said.",
    "The U.S. government has not made comments about Brazil\u2019s move.",
    "Earlier, a Brazilian government official told The Associated Press Brazil understands that the case could drag on and there\u2019s no guarantee of success. The official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the matter publicly, spoke on condition of anonymity.",
    "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has repeatedly said that the trade body needs a revamp to be enabled to mediate in conflicts.",
    "Brazil\u2019s government estimates that 35.9% of the country\u2019s goods shipped to the American market have been affected. That is about 4% of Brazil\u2019s total exports.",
    "Trump directly tied the 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to the judicial situation of his embattled ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest.",
    "Last month, Bolsonaro was ordered to wear an electronic ankle monitor and to obey a curfew while the proceedings are underway. Lula is yet to speak about the move.",
    "On Tuesday, the leftist leader said he wouldn\u2019t call Trump to talk about trade \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t want to\u201d speak about it. Lula said that he might instead \u201cinvite him to attend (November\u2019s climate summit) COP in Belem.\u201d"
