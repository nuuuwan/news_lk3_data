    "Since 2003, CFW has played a pivotal role in reviving, guiding, and building pride in Sri Lanka\u2019s fashion industry. From humble beginnings featuring a handful of designers, it has blossomed into a thriving ecosystem embracing sustainability and empowering young talent. More than 80% of today\u2019s leading Sri Lankan designers are the product of CFW\u2019s development system, a testament to its impact.",
