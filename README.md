### Singapore’s disgraced former minister S. Iswaran jailed in landmark case

A Singapore court on Thursday sentenced a former minister to 12 months in prison for obstructing justice and receiving more than $300,000 worth of gifts, in the first jailing of an ex-cabinet member in a city-state famous for its clean governance.

S. Iswaran, who was a cabinet member for 13 years and has held the trade, communications and transport portfolios, pleaded guilty last week to four counts of improperly receiving gifts and one of obstructing justice.

The sentence handed down was more severe than the six to seven months sought by the prosecution, which presiding judge Vincent Hoong said was “manifestly inadequate” given the gravity of Iswaran’s offences and their impact on public trust.

“Trust and confidence in public institutions were the bedrock of effective governance, which could all too easily be undermined by the appearance that an individual public servant had fallen below the standards of integrity and accountability,” he said in sentencing Iswaran.

MA Sumanthiran, a spokesman for the Sri Lankan Tamil state party and former MP MA Sumanthiran, has demanded that the government immediately release the names of former MPs and politicians who have obtained liquor permits in the previous administration.

Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Sumanthiran emphasized the need for transparency in the wake of controversy over the increase in liquor stores across the country.

He urged the government to publish a list of people responsible to recommend to open these companies.

“There is a widespread issue in liquor stores across the country, and the public is worthy of knowing which MPs or politicians have approved these licenses.

This should be made public before the upcoming election, so those involved will be excluded from the future.

Sumanthiran stressed that the increase in liquor outlets is a significant social issue that will have adverse effects on the younger generation.
