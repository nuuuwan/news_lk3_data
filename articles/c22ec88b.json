    "European and NATO leaders will join Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his crucial meeting with President Trump on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday.",
    "The move in relation to the key White House meeting is an apparent effort to prevent a repeat of the heated encounter Zelenskyy faced when he met Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in February.",
    "The European leaders\u2019 presence at Zelenskyy\u2019s side, demonstrating Europe\u2019s support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Zelenskyy risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Mr. Trump says he wants to broker with Russia.",
    "Von der Leyen, head of the European Union\u2019s executive branch, posted on X that \u201cat the request of President Zelenskyy, I will join the meeting with President Trump and other European leaders in the White House tomorrow.\u201d",
    "In a quick succession Sunday, a stream of European leaders also announced that they\u2019ll be going. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, the chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz, and the secretary general of the NATO military alliance, Mark Rutte.",
    "The grouped trip underscored European leaders\u2019 determination to ensure that Europe has a voice in Trump\u2019s attempted peace-making, after the U.S. president\u2019s summit on Friday with Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u2014 to which Zelenskyy wasn\u2019t invited."
