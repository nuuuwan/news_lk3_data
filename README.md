Our Sudumalai Bhubaneswari Ambal Temple is a mythical and novelty temple. It was decided to rebuild the temple with the narrow thinking of the temple administration.

The oldest buildings set up by our ancestors claimed for the reconstruction work were demolished. Thus there is a risk of going without old evidence. We do not prevent the construction of the rehab. The oldest of the temple will illustrate our existence.

A Southern California cardiologist flying Qatar Airways from Los Angeles to Sri Lanka was denied the vegetarian meal he had ordered, then died after choking on a piece of food while attempting to “eat around” the meat in meal he was given instead, according to his grieving family.

The pilot couldn’t make an emergency landing to get 85-year-old Asoka Jayaweera to a doctor because the plane was “traveling over the Arctic Circle/Ocean,” alleges a newly filed wrongful death lawsuit obtained by The Independent.

However, Jayaweera’s son Surya contends the aircraft was actually over the Midwest at the time and could have easily diverted, their complaint states.

When the flight eventually touched down in Edinburgh, Scotland, Jayaweera, a “strict vegetarian,” had been unconscious for some three-and-a-half hours, according to the complaint. It says he was taken to the hospital – but that it was already too late.

### Sri Lanka’s economic recovery remains incomplete as key challenges persist, World Bank says

Despite Sri Lanka’s strong economic performance in recent times, the recovery remains incomplete, with growth still below pre-crisis levels and poverty significantly elevated, the World Bank said.

The World Bank noted that strengthening the recovery will require continued macroeconomic stability, urgent structural reforms and more efficient, better-targeted public spending.

The latest Sri Lanka Development Update, ‘Better Spending for All’ released by the World Bank today (07), projects Sri Lanka’s economy to grow by 4.6 percent in 2025 — supported by a modest rebound in industry and steady growth in services — before slowing to 3.5 percent in 2026. This outlook is subject to heightened risks, including from elevated global uncertainty.

“While Sri Lanka’s recent economic progress is encouraging, the recovery is uneven and incomplete,” said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
