    "Contests to elect heads and deputy heads of hung local councils are continuing, with the government and the Opposition making no-holds-barred efforts to gain control of those institutions. In doing so, they have revealed their true colours; they act out of expediency rather than principle. The outcome of Monday\u2019s elections to the posts of chairperson and deputy chairperson in the Beruwala Urban Council is a case in point.",
    "Sri Lankan politics arguably resembles a game of Cops and Robbers, where the government in waiting assumes the role of the cops, portraying those in power as robbers, vowing to catch them. The JVP-led NPP, while in the Opposition, branded all its rivals as robbers and sought a mandate to throw all of them behind bars. It secured the presidency and a supermajority to a strong government. In the run-up to the 06 May local government polls, it declared that it would never close ranks with any other political party/independent group to gain control of local councils. The SJB also made a similar vow, accusing the NPP of corrupt deals and abuse of power. However, the outcome of the mini polls has made both sides resort to horse trading to secure control of hung councils, letting their much-avowed policies, principles and scruples fall by the wayside.",
    "The NPP councillors and their SJB counterparts are widely considered sworn enemies, but they closed ranks in the Beruwala UC on Monday to defeat an Independent group that had secured a plurality (07 seats) in that hung council. The NPP, which has only 03 seats, bagged the UC with the help of 06 SJB councillors! It was a case of the self-proclaimed cops honeymooning with the robbers.",
    "Last month, a similar alliance was forged in the Norwood PS, where the NPP and the CWC have 06 seats each, the SJB 05 seats, the UNP 01 seat, the DNA 01 seat and Independent Group 01 seat. The councillors of the NPP and the SJB got together to gain control of that PS. The NPP said its councillors had acted without its blessings. The SJB made a similar claim. Both parties promised disciplinary action against their members over the controversial alliance. However, the situation in the Beruwala UC is different in that the NPP came a poor third there in the LG polls. It will be interesting to see what the NPP has got to say about the unholy alliance between its councillors and SJB members in the Beruwala UC. The SJB has reportedly said it will suspend the party membership of its six councillors.",
    "Immediately after the declaration of the LG polls results in May, the NPP took up the position that it should be allowed to control the hung councils where it had obtained pluralities. Ideally, that is what the Opposition should have done. The parties or the Independent groups that obtained more seats than the runners-up in the non-majority councils should have been allowed to administer those institutions. The NPP should have adopted a conciliatory approach, and the Opposition led by the SJB should have reciprocated in the interest of the public. The NPP is still the most popular political party in the country though its popularity is on the wane, and the SJB, which is apparently recovering lost ground, should have come to terms with the ground reality and acted accordingly. Sadly, driven by expediency, the Opposition parties opted to join forces and make a determined bid to seize control of the hung councils. They have succeeded in defeating the NPP in dozens of such local government bodies, but their success achieved through tactical manoeuvrings and opportunistic alliances is not likely to help them win back popular support. In Beruwala, the NPP upended its own policy in respect of the hung councils.",
    "Politicians and political commentators have blamed the Mixed Proportional system, under which the LG polls are conducted, for the mess in hung councils. This argument is not without some merit, but the real problem, in our book, is the rotten political culture in this country, where politicians and political parties lack maturity and subjugate public interest to political expediency.",
    "It is commonly said in this country that a cobra and a mongoose, when caught in swirling flood waters, forget their enmity and cling to the same floating log and cooperate to maintain its balance so that they can stay afloat. The NPP and the SJB have done just that in Beruwala.",
