    "The two British actors-Bill Hurst and Paul Costa- are playing the roles of Darrell Hair and Ross Emerson, according to MS Sripathy, the writer and director of Murali 800 biopic.",
    "Speaking exclusively, he said, in the biopic we are not revealing the Australian umpires (Hair and Emerson) names. This is to avoid any legal hassles\".",
    "These two actors may not be big names but Bill Hurst is known for The Golden Compass (2007), The Lost City of Z (2016) and The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006). Paul Costa is known for Still Green (2007), Hawaii Five-0 (2010) and Get a Job (2012).",
    "\"We have completed the shootings of all star casts. We are now waiting for the music, sound effects and visual effects to be over before the biopic is ready\".",
    "However, within 2-3 months, the film is likely to be released.",
    "\"The climax of the Murali 800 Biopic is India because Murali's 800th Test wicket was against India\".",
    "\"The shootings were done in Sri Lanka, Chennai, Cochin, England and Australia\".",
    "Incidentally, Chennai is also Murali's in-laws' city. Muralitharan married Madhimalar Ramamurthy, a Chennai native, on 21 March 2005. Madhimalar is the daughter of the late Dr S. Ramamurthy of Malar Hospitals, and his wife Dr Nithya Ramamurthy.",
    "\"Madhi's role is played by an Indian actress Mahima Nambiyar and Murali's role by Madhur Mittal. The roles of the 1996 World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, India's legendary cricketer Kapil Dev and many other cricketers are done by actors from Asian countries\", he further added.",
    "A Boxing Day game is something that you very much look forward to. In 1995, the controversy opened up in the Boxing day Test match against Sri Lanka in Australia. The Australian umpire Darrell Hair called no-ball for Murali\u2019s bowling action. It happened again in the ODI series. This time, it was the umpire Ross Emerson who called no-ball even for the leg breaks bowled by Muralitharan.\u00a0(BIPIN DANI)"
