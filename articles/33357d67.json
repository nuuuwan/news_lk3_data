  "original_body_lines": [
    "The enactment of the Bill in its current form, will \u2018not\u2019 be capable of delivering consistent and sustainable growth along with the creation of new livelihood options for most of the citizens whilst enhancing their disposable incomes",
    "This submission is made in the long-term sustainable interests of Sri Lanka and all its people; and sets out some critical aspects to be considered by COPF, prior to proceeding with the enactment of the proposed Economic Transformation Bill:",
    "1. Sri Lanka\u2019s best option for inclusive growth requires a mixed bag of reforms to enhance new investments and tradable goods share of growth whilst assuring the bottom 40% of the segment of society have income enhancement for livelihood support,",
    "Beginning with political stability, policy consistency, ease of doing business, improved factor productivity, good governance, safe and corruption-free destination with property rights and effective dispute resolution mechanisms,",
    "Whilst leveraging on developing effective supply chain linkages focused on India and China, and possibly extending to cover options with Asian Tigers.",
    "In addition, enhancing per capita incomes of the majority marginal/variable income earners, addressing the specific needs of poor and vulnerable, through new livelihood opportunities led by human resource development, skills upgrading with an acceptable work culture attitudinal change,",
    "In addition, lead to enhancement of local consumption led growth; and will require focused training, technology transfers and infrastructure developments, all going beyond the present focus only of reaching debt sustainability.",
    "2. The enactment of the Bill in its current form, will \u2018not\u2019 be capable of delivering consistent and sustainable growth along with the creation of new livelihood options for most of the citizens whilst enhancing their disposable incomes! This segment of society is currently drastically impacted by cost of living, hunger, malnutrition, and lack opportunities for human development. This failure is in the context of a severe shortage in meeting market needs for a supportive skilled workforce, and an effectively connected efficient national growth facilitative infrastructure.",
    "3. Whilst acknowledging the need for disciplined and strategic change management in the areas as focused by the Bill in reducing the national debt to planned levels and enabling the nation to enter international credit markets, will it simultaneously lead to be a crucial turnaround contributor to spur the realisation of the welfare and wellbeing of most citizens \u2018and\u2019 the timely realisation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?",
    "4. The key challenges ahead to be focused by COPF in reviewing the Bill are:",
    "The critical negative impact on currently BOI registered positive value adding enterprises enabled to enjoy the contractual obligations only via a transitionary provision of this Bill. Will this lead to externally raised compensation claims under MIGA or other investment protection treaty rights of investors?",
    "The significant risks that upon one or many of the macroeconomic targets of this bill not being met or any commitments and delivery commitment of many new Economic Zones not being met will lead to externally raised compensation claims under MIGA or other investment protection treaty rights of investors?",
    "The current consumer protection framework being near zero in enforcement and without effective legal reforms bringing in effective protection supported by",
    "4. The desired economic transformation objectives will not be realised without effective and acceptable trade facilitation exceeding the WTO minimum standards exceeded in other competing Asian states, highly capable and committed trade negotiators and effective economic diplomacy, and linkages/penetration into linkages all key international trade chambers and especially linkages to supply chains of emerging competitive production destinations",
    "5. Critically question whether the five new public institutions proposed to be established can be avoided by effective restructure, change management, infusion of new talent, skills, and professionalism and using existing institutions where necessary with amalgamations and change of objectives and accountabilities. For example, will a restructured Board of Investments be an option? Can an amalgamation of the Institute of Policy Studies/Institute of Fundamental Studies and Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute replace the planned research Institute and can an amalgamated SLINTEC/CISIR/Industrial Development Board/Other Key Research Institutes not be the vehicles to implement the provisions of the Bill?",
    "6. Consider the value of incorporating the following additions, amendments to the Bill:",
    "\u201cAnd Whereas Governance Diagnostic Assessment of the International Monetary Fund conducted during March 2023 focused on corruption vulnerabilities and governance weaknesses linked to corruption in macro-economically critical priority areas of:",
    "(i) the anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.",
    "(ii) fiscal governance (e.g., public financial management, tax policy and revenue administration, state enterprise management, and public procurement);",
    "(iv) financial sector oversight; and (v) enforcement of contract and protection of property\u00a0 rights and concluded that confronting corruption in Sri Lanka effectively requires short-term actions to address core vulnerabilities combined with more long-term actions to introduce structural changes in governance and accountability that address the underlying governance weaknesses and dismantling current protections that afford officials immunity for their actions is fundamental to achieving and sustaining successes",
    "Whereas in terms of the Article 28 of the Constitution it is the duty of every person in Sri Lanka\u2013",
    "(d) to preserve and protect public property and to combat misuse and waste of public property.",
    "3. Include undersection 2 of the Bill \u2018the objects of the National Policy on Economic",
