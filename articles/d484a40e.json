    "The Mediation (Civil and Commercial Disputes) Bill has been published in the Gazette and presented to Parliament last month (July 2025). Although mediation has been used in Sri Lanka since 1989 for the resolution of minor disputes at community level through Mediation Boards established by government under two statutes there is very little knowledge in Sri Lanka of its value and use worldwide for the resolution of more complex civil and commercial disputes and for Investor-State disputes. There are distinct differences between mediation, litigation, and arbitration. This article seeks to demystify the concept of mediation.",
    "There are many styles of mediation, the popular being  Facilitative Mediation also known as Traditional Mediation because in the early times this was the only known style of mediation. The Mediator, as a neutral third-party, assists disputants in communicating effectively to better understand their deepest concerns and needs to reach a settlement that best suits them. The intervention of a neutral third party offers prospects for settlement that direct negotiations between disputants or their representatives do not. This article deals only with facilitative mediation which is the type mainly practiced in Sri Lanka. The UN Mediation Convention, the domestic legislation enacted in 2024 and the current Bill, provide for principles that are universally adopted in facilitative mediation.",
    "Two other styles are Transformative Mediation and  Evaluative Mediation. The distinction among these are based on the role of the Mediator and the ultimate objective to be achieved. In Transformative Mediation the focus is on helping parties to appreciate the concerns and interests of the other party and the objective is to transform fractured relationships to an extent that the parties better understand each other\u2019s perspectives. It is used widely but not exclusively in family mediations. In  Evaluative Mediation the Mediator assesses the facts relevant to the dispute and gives an opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of the positions of each party. That opinion is often based on law and legal principles and the Mediator may offer recommendations as to how the dispute could be resolved. Each style has its value depending on the factors relevant to the dispute.",
    "Facilitative Mediation is used for a wide range of disputes including community level minor disputes, family disputes, employment disputes, commercial disputes and Investor-State disputes. It could be used as the sole choice or even prior to or during other dispute resolution processes such as litigation and arbitration. The key features of the process for all categories are the same and are universally accepted, including in the UN Mediation Convention. The main features are that the Mediator plays a facilitative non coercive role to help parties reach a settlement; the Mediator does not impose a solution on the disputants; the process is confidential; the Mediator is neutral and impartial; party autonomy is upheld; and a settlement is entered into only when parties are fully agreeable to the terms. These key features are incorporated in the Bill and are discussed below.",
    "The Bill provides for a governance regime for the conduct of mediations in respect of civil and commercial disputes. The provisions seek to ensure compliance with universally accepted norms within the local context. The Bill does not seek to establish entities or Boards as in the other 2 statutes administered by Government nor does it provide for mandatory reference to mediation other than when referred by court. While mediations can be conducted to resolve disputes even without a statute, the value in having a statute is that it lays down compliance requirements that ensure its responsible use in conformity with universally accepted standards.",
    "The terms \u2018civil\u2019 and \u2018commercial\u2019 are not defined. Although \u2018civil\u2019 includes \u2018commercial\u2019, the title seeks to emphasize its coverage. These terms are not defined in other domestic statutes either. The UN Mediation Convention does not define the term \u201ccommercial\u201d. During the deliberations at UNCITRAL to formulate the text of the Convention, it was agreed that a definition of the term \u201ccommercial\u201d was not required. The UNCITRAL Model Law (2018) does not contain a definition either but provides an explanation in a footnote to Article 1(1) which includes that the term \u201ccommercial\u201d should be given a wide interpretation to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature. It proceeds to set out some of those relationships.",
    "The Bill sets out categories of disputes that are not mediatable, ie. disputes that cannot be settled and brought to closure through mediation. These are disputes the settlement of which requires the inclusion of terms that can be given effect to, only on a decree or order of a court including eleven (11) categories of disputes set out in the schedule to the Bill. These include disputes seeking a dissolution of marriage (divorce), nullity of marriage and disputes in respect of which rights in rem are sought, such as partition of immovable property (unless it is an amicable partition between parties which do not bind non signatories). While these disputes can be brought to finality only with a decree of court, matters relevant to such disputes can be mediated for the purpose of submitting terms of settlement to court for consideration of incorporation in a judgment, decree, or order in compliance with applicable law.",
    "Mediation is a voluntary process. Disputants can submit a mediatable dispute to mediation voluntarily. However, many jurisdictions have also provided for mandatory reference to mediation by courts or in terms of statutory provisions. These are mandatory pre litigation or pre trial steps that favour an attempt to settle either prior to accessing court, or during a court proceeding but prior to trial.",
    "When there is a pre-dispute Mediation clause in a contract, ie. a clause stating that any dispute arising shall be referred to mediation, that choice must be honoured and parties must then submit the dispute to mediation and cannot file action in court or go for arbitration, because mediation is their voluntary choice. Further, if a mediation has commenced, no action can be filed in court until the process is over. A pre dispute Mediation clause is the same as an arbitration clause in a contract. A multi-tiered or hybrid dispute resolution clause could also be opted for, to",
    "provide for the use of both arbitration and mediation. Here, parties could use mediation first, followed by arbitration if mediation fails (Med-Arb) or use mediation within the arbitration process (Arb-Med-Arb). If parties agree, a dispute can be referred to mediation even without a pre-dispute mediation clause.",
    "The Mediation Bill includes provision to empower a court at its discretion upon a consideration of all relevant circumstances, to refer a dispute or any part thereof to mediation. Court referred mediation may be seen as mandatory mediation, but the court only decides to refer the dispute to mediation, and the parties are obligated to enter the mediation process and attempt settlement in good faith as in a voluntary mediation and they have complete and unfettered discretion and control over the decision to settle or not to settle. The fact that a dispute is court referred does not impose a heavier burden on the disputants to settle. Hence mandatory reference by court or by virtue of a statutory provision, does not detract from the principle of voluntariness.",
