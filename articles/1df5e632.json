  "original_title": "\u2018Embrace change, rather than fear it\u2019: Personal Transformation Coach Sharika Mubarack",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a powerful address to a room full of aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders recently, Sharika Mubarack, a distinguished Personal Transformation Coach and business leader, shared profound insights from her personal journey. Her message was clear: the path to leadership is one of continuous growth, self-reflection and embracing change, even in times of uncertainty.",
    "With over 18 years of diverse experience spanning multiple sectors, Mubarack\u2019s journey from management accounting to entrepreneurship and coaching has been anything but conventional. Speaking with warmth and authenticity, she reflected on three key lessons that shaped her career and personal growth, offering these insights as guiding principles for future leaders.",
    "Mubarack began her career in the corporate world, working as a management accountant, a seemingly stable and predictable path.",
    "However, she soon realized that stability did not equate to fulfillment. Driven by an desire for something more, she left her corporate career to pursue her passion for writing and entrepreneurship.",
    "\u201cI carved my own path,\u201d she recounted, highlighting the bold decision to transition into her family business and eventually establish her own entrepreneurial venture. Mubarack emphasized that true growth comes when individuals embrace change rather than fear it.",
    "\u201cWe often cling to the familiar, but true growth comes when we open ourselves up to new possibilities, even when they feel uncertain,\u201d she said, encouraging the audience to approach change with curiosity instead of stress.",
    "Reflecting on a time of national crisis, Mubarack spoke about Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 movement, a period of civil unrest that led many to flee the country. The uncertainty and anxiety were palpable, she acknowledged, but rather than allow fear to drive her decisions, she chose to stay.",
    "\u201cWhat I realized is that every time someone left, a fresh opportunity was created for those who stayed, she said, pointing out that even in the darkest times, opportunities arise for those willing to look for them. Mubarack drew a powerful comparison to the resilience of people in Gaza, highlighting their ability to persevere and push forward in unimaginable circumstances.",
    "\u201cEven in crisis, there is always opportunity, she said, urging aspiring leaders to seek innovation and adaptation in times of challenge.",
    "Mubarack\u2019s final lesson focused on personal transformation\u2014an area in which she has built her expertise as a coach and mentor. She described how many clients come to her with a list of external problems they believe are holding them back.",
    "Her response is both practical and profound: true change does not come from external circumstances but from within. \u201cWould you like me to go out and change the world for you so you can be problem-free?\u201d she joked, adding that real transformation begins when individuals shift their own mindset.",
    "Quoting the Holy Quran, she reminded the audience: \u201cGod will not change the situation of a person unless they change what\u2019s in themselves.\u201d Mubarack stressed that our beliefs, attitudes, and values are what truly shape our reality and the world around us.",
    "As Mubarack concluded her talk, she left the room with a powerful message: future leaders must embrace change, look for opportunities even in times of crisis, and understand that the most significant transformations come from within.",
