    "A major debate is unfolding on the government\u2019s proposed changes to Sri Lanka\u2019s education system. Led by Prime Minister and Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, the reforms aim to change what subjects that students must study and what they can choose. While the plan promises more flexibility with new elective subjects, many parents, teachers, and experts are concerned. The big question now is\u2014will these reforms truly benefit our children, or will they widen the gap between urban and rural schools?",
    "While education reform is not a new phenomenon, its urgency has been intensified by global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, digital transformation, widening social inequalities, and the need for future-ready skills. In this context, education is no longer limited to literacy or schooling\u2014it must enable individuals to navigate complexity, think critically, collaborate across cultures, and adapt to rapid change. Consequently, many countries have launched reforms that focus on curriculum innovation, digital integration, inclusive education, and learner-centred pedagogy.",
    "In recent years, the Government of Sri Lanka has proposed successive waves of reform, most notably under the leadership of Dr. Susil Premajayantha (2022) and Dr. Harini Amarasuriya (2025). These reform agendas reflect a growing recognition of the need to modernise general, higher, and vocational education. While the 2022 proposals emphasised outcomes-based planning, technological adaptation, and stakeholder engagement, the 2025 roadmap focuses on curriculum reform, human resource development, infrastructure, and systematic assessment. (See Table 1)",
    "The 2022 reforms are stronger in calling for public engagement and participatory planning. By contrast, the 2025 reforms lean toward top-down planning, which may limit buy-in from communities, teachers, and students.",
    "Recommendation: Reforms must be social movements, not just policy interventions. Broaden civic engagement through public dialogues, school councils, parent forums, and student voice initiatives.",
    "Reforming an education system is not just about fixing what\u2019s broken\u2014it\u2019s about reimagining the purpose of education in shaping a just, sustainable, and dynamic society. Sri Lanka has the legacy of free education and the intellectual capital to lead South Asia in educational transformation.",
    "Both reform initiatives offer valuable foundations, but their success will depend on:",
    "These reforms must not merely be administrative exercises or infrastructure drives. They must produce engaged learners, reflective teachers, inclusive schools, and a generation ready to lead Sri Lanka into the 21st century.",
    "Globally, education reform has often taken shape under the influence of international organisations like the OECD, UNESCO, and World Bank, which have promoted frameworks such as Education for All (EFA) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The OECD\u2019s PISA assessments have particularly influenced curriculum reforms by promoting evidence-based policymaking and comparative performance metrics.",
    "In many countries, reforms focus on outcome-based education (OBE), competency-based curricula, and school autonomy. For instance, Finland has been recognised for its holistic and child-centred approach, emphasising equity, teacher autonomy, and trust-based accountability. Conversely, the United States has oscillated between centralization and decentralization in reform, with programmes like No Child Left Behind (2001) and Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) promoting standards, testing, and school choice.",
    "A core component of education reform involves curriculum redesign to align with the needs of the 21st-century knowledge society. This includes integrating digital literacy, critical thinking, collaboration, and global citizenship into learning outcomes. Pedagogically, reforms often advocate learner-centred, constructivist approaches that promote inquiry-based learning and project-based work.",
    "However, in many contexts, especially in developing countries, implementation remains exam-driven, reinforcing rote learning and limiting creative engagement. This has led to concerns about the \u201cimplementation gap\u201d, where well-intentioned reforms fail due to capacity limitations, resistance from stakeholders, or inadequate funding.",
    "Here\u2019s an enhanced table with color-coded categories and a focus on South Asia alongside global comparators. This version helps lay readers quickly understand where each country stands on religion in school curricula: (See Table 2)",
    "\ud83d\udfe5 Secular \u2013 No religion taught in state schools (e.g., France, USA, India)",
    "\u2013 Single dominant religion embedded in national curriculum (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Pakistan)",
    "\ud83d\udfe6 Multi-faith \u2013 Multiple religions offered based on student affiliation (e.g., Sri Lanka, Bangladesh)",
    "\ud83d\udfe8 Hybrid \u2013 Combination of religion and ethics/moral reasoning with student/parent choice (e.g., Germany, Norway)",
    "\ud83d\udd36 Optional \u2013 Religious education not mandatory, based on parental choice or school type",
    "Whether religion should be a subject in school curricula remains a deeply contested issue, particularly in pluralistic societies. In many advanced economies like Australia, France, New Zealand and the United States, religion is excluded from public school curricula to maintain a clear separation between church and state, emphasizing secular civic values and neutrality. In contrast, countries like the UK, Germany, and Norway adopt a more inclusive approach\u2014offering comparative religious education or allowing students to opt between religious and ethical studies. These models aim not to promote faith, but to foster understanding, tolerance, and critical thinking about belief systems in a multicultural world.",
    "Critics argue that including religion in the curriculum risks indoctrination, especially if one faith is privileged over others or if the teaching lacks academic neutrality. On the other hand, proponents contend that understanding religion\u2019s cultural, historical, and moral dimensions is essential for global citizenship and social cohesion. For developing nations like Sri Lanka, the challenge lies in balancing cultural-religious identity with a modern, secular educational vision that equips students for diverse, democratic societies without reinforcing sectarian divides.",
