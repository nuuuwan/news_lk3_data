### UK names Mullally as first female Archbishop to lead Church of England

*2025-10-03 14:53:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113185/uk-names-mullally-as-first-female-archbishop-to-lead-church-of-england) · `en`

Britain appointed Sarah Mullally as the new Archbishop of Canterbury on Friday, the first time a woman has been named leader of the Church of England in the 1,400 year history of the role.

Mullally also becomes the ceromonial head of some 85 million Anglicans worldwide, with the appointment of a woman risking deeper theological divides with some of the more conservative branches of the church in African nations.

Reforms introduced 11 years ago made it possible for a woman to hold the office, and by being named as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury, Mullally becomes the female leader of one of last areas of British public life to have been led by men.

But for Anglicans globally, about two-thirds of whom live in countries like Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, the appointment of the first female Archbishop could further highlight their difference with the mother church in England.

Former Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya stated that the current calls for Provincial Council elections are being made merely to demonstrate that there is public opposition to the incumbent government.

He pointed out that no Member of Parliament has raised the issue, either in Parliament or elsewhere, that Provincial Council elections are genuinely needed.

Deshapriya further emphasized that the demand for such elections cannot be justified unless the people are made to understand why they are necessary.

He expressed these views while participating in a seminar held in Colombo on the subject of Provincial Council elections.
