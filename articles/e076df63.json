    "Says challenge of transforming public service into streamlined State mechanism lies ahead of us",
    "Points to newly appointed committee to make impartial decisions without political interference",
    "Opines no intention to downsize public service, while admitting concerns about high expenditure involved",
    "Calls to maintain harmony and mutual accountability between public officials and political authorities",
    "Assures to defend public officials facing unjust challenges; warns against neglect or obstruction of duties",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday underscored the urgent need to overhaul public service, pointing to the critical challenge of transforming Sri Lanka\u2019s public service into an efficient state mechanism.",
    "Addressing a conference of District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries at the Home Affairs Ministry Auditorium, located in the \u201cNila Medura\u201d building in Narahenpita, he outlined a vision for a more efficient and trustworthy State mechanism.",
    "Dissanayake pointed out that the newly appointed committee tasked with reviewing State institutions would make decisions without being influenced by political pressures.",
    "The President noted that the public service, which has undergone multiple name changes from Government Agents to District Secretaries, boasts a history of nearly 200 years. He emphasised its pivotal role in steering the country towards a new direction.",
    "However, the President stated that the current situation is far from satisfactory regarding the ultimate goals and objectives. He noted that the public has no trust in receiving fair services from state institutions and emphasised that the entire system has collapsed as a functioning State mechanism.",
    "The President asserted that both political authorities and the public service must ask themselves whether they are prepared to restore the broken system.",
    "He clarified that his focus was not on the positions within public service but rather on who occupies those positions and their ability to lead effectively. He also highlighted the lack of dynamic leadership in certain sectors, a gap he aims to address by providing training for 1,500 officials in India, as agreed upon during his recent visit.",
    "Additionally, he said the Government intends to grant scholarships for higher education abroad to a significant number of students who pass the Advanced Level examinations next year.",
    "Dissanayake argued the basis on which some institutions and positions were established and reiterated the challenge of transforming the public service into an efficient state mechanism. This, he noted, requires a new framework.",
    "He reaffirmed the commitment to reviewing State institutions through the newly established committee, which will make impartial decisions uninfluenced by political interference. While there is no intention to downsize the public service, the President acknowledged concerns about the high expenditure involved in maintaining it. He advocated for reforms to make the system more efficient and structured.",
    "The President also stressed the importance of re-evaluating community-based projects and announced plans to expedite the Digital Identity Card initiative and launch the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d project starting 1 January 2025.",
    "He assured his full political support for these initiatives while emphasising that their success depends on the contribution of public officials. Noting that 80% of the mandate rests on public sector employees, the President emphasised the need for harmony and mutual accountability between political authorities and State sector employees.",
    "Accordingly, the President stated that previous mandates have demonstrated alignment between the expectations and goals of political authorities and the public service. He added that both sides are in agreement on the tasks at hand.",
    "The President also noted plans to implement several projects under three key areas: eradicating poverty, digital transformation, and reshaping societal attitudes through the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d project. These efforts aim to elevate the country to a new level.",
    "Dissanayake assured that he would stand in defend of any official who faces challenges, injustice, or unfair treatment while working towards these goals. However, he warned that any deliberate efforts by an official to obstruct or neglect these tasks would be met with equally firm action.",
    "The event was attended by Prime Minister Dr.Harini Amarasuriya, Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Dr. A.H.M.H. Abeyrathne, Deputy Minister P. Ruwan Senarath, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister G. Pradeep Saputhanthri, Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government S. Aloka Bandara, along with District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries, and other officials."
