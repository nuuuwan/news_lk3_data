    "\u201cWe are humbled to be consistently recognized at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards. At Nestl\u00e9, sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and it is an honour to be able to demonstrate our sustainability journey at a platform of this stature and be inspired by how Sri Lanka is moving forward in the realm of sustainability. The past few years have had its fair range of challenges, and it required everyone, including us corporates, to review and reinvent our strategies. Nonetheless, I am proud that we were able to continue our untiring efforts of doing good together, creating a more sustainable and resilient Sri Lanka with our stakeholders across and beyond the value chain. Staying true to our promise of \u2018Good food, Good life\u2019, we will forge ahead towards achieving our ambitious sustainability commitments whilst being a force for good in Sri Lanka, as we have for over 115 years!\u201d said Bernie Stefan, Managing Director of Nestl\u00e9 Lanka.",
