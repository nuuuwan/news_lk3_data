    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil National Alliance (TNA), though it is for a federal solution, insists on the full implementation of the 13th amendment to the constitution and also demands elections to the provincial councils be held as soon as possible, the party said.",
    "In a statement released on Monday July 31, the TNA responding to criticism that it keeps changing its mind on a solution to the country\u2019s ethnic issue said its position has been consistent.",
    "\u201cOur position is that power devolution must be in a federal structure, consistent with the aspirations of the Tamil people expressed at every election since 1956. The 13th amendment to the constitution is part of the constitution of Sri Lanka, and not a separate appendage. The president and all of us have taken an oath to uphold and defend it. Thus, the non-implimentation of any part of the constitution is a violation of the whole. To that extent, we insist on the full implementation of the devolution arrangement currently extant in our constitution,\u201d the party said.",
    "However, this does not meet the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil people, the party added.",
    "The statement noted that the need for meaningful power sharing has been recognised both locally and on at least three separate joint statements issued with the government of India, under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "TNA legislator M A Sumanthiran said at a recent discussion with President Ranil Wickremesinghe that not devolving police powers to the provinces would mean the country is going back on this commitment. The MP said this would not be meaningful.",
    "Responding to the MP, President Wickremesinghe said while he agrees with Rajapaksa that there should be full implementation of the 13th amendment, there was an outcry when Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration had proposed the same.",
    "\u201cFirstly, I\u2019m Ranil Wickremesinghe, not Ranil Rajapaksa. I\u2019m not bound by \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say what President Rajapaksa did, but I do go along with him that there has to be full implementation of the 13th amendment. But in the discussion we had earlier, when I mentioned full implementation, there was a big outcry and we decided that we\u2019ll go ahead and take up police powers later. So you have to decide on that,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "At an all-party conference on July 26, Wickemesinghe said Sri Lanka must either retain its provincial councils (PCs) with powers adequately devolved as provided for by the 13th amendment to the constitution or abolish the PC system entirely.",
    "In its July 31 statement, the TNA also called for provincial council elections which have been delayed by three years.",
    "\u201cNine provincial councils that were functioning, albeit with deficiencies, have ceased to be due to a legal snag in the process of changing the electoral system. The select committee on electoral reform under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunwardena in its report submitted to this parliament last year has stated that the provincial council elections which have been delayed for more than three years negates the democratic rights of the people, and has recommended to hold the election under the proportional representation (PR) system that existed previously,\u201d the party said.",
    "The select committee had also recommended that suitable legislation be enacted to enable this, the statement \u2013 signed by Sumanthiran \u2013 said.",
    "The MP also highlighted a private member\u2019s bill he had presented to parliament in line with the select committee\u2019s recommendation. The bill was challenged in the Supreme Court, after which the Court determined that it was not inconsistent with the constitution and it can be enacted by a simple majority as long as amendments were made to clauses 3 and 4 of the bill.",
    "The provisions of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988, as was extant on 21st September, 2017, shall for all purposes be deemed to be and to have been in operation as if the same had not been amended by the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017.",
    "Clause 4, which the Supreme Court has determined should be deleted is as follows:",
    "Any act done or purported to have been done after 22nd September, 2017, in terms of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988 is deemed to have been done, mutatis mutandis, in terms of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988 as was extant on 21st September, 2017.",
    "\u201cThe Tamil national alliance unequivocally conveyed to the president at the first all-party conference on December 10, 2022, that the provincial council elections must be held without further delay. We also discussed measures necessary to make devolution meaningful. Several discussions were held with the president and at that second all-party conference on 26 January 2023 we again reiterated our position,\u201d the TNA said in its statement.",
    "This same position was conveyed again at the most recent all-party conference on July 26, the party said.",
    "There was absolutely no change of positions by the TNA; nor is there any contradiction between calling for immediate provincial council elections and enhanced and meaningful devolution, the TNA said.",
    "The full implementation of the 13th amendment continues to be a point of debate, with a number of political parties in the south boycotting the July 26 all-party conference.",
    "President Wickremesinghe has indicated his willingness to fully implement the amendment, particularly in light of India stressing on its importance. However, sharing police powers remains an issue, with many national parties in the south arguing against it.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and",
    "Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment would see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more hardline parties. In February, sections of the Buddhist clergy took to the streets against the proposed full implementation of the constitutional amendment. (Colombo/Jul31/2023)"
