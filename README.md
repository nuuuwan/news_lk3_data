### Putin wins Russia election in landslide with no serious competition

(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin won a record post-Soviet landslide in Russia’s election on Sunday, cementing his already tight grip on power in a victory he said showed Moscow had been right to stand up to the West and send its troops into Ukraine.

Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who first rose to power in 1999, made it clear that the result should send a message to the West that its leaders will have to reckon with an emboldened Russia, whether in war or in peace, for many more years to come.

The outcome means Putin, 71, is set to embark on a new six-year term that will see him overtake Josef Stalin and become Russia’s longest-serving leader for more than 200 years if he completes it.

On the eighth day of the day, a protest march was held in front of the Sivankoili in Trincomalee on Sunday evening, demanding the release of the arrest and the arrest of the arrest during the worship of the Shivaratri Mountain Shiva Temple.

Social activists have organized a controversy and condemning the release of those who were arrested during the incident at the Vedukkuni Mountain.

Worship is our fundamental right of the Adi Shiva Temple, our ancestry, do not take Buddhism under the guise of archaeological archaeologies, who gave the police the right to prevent worship, immediately release the temple administrators, and the native identity of the Tamils.

Agathiyar Adinam said that the repression of the incident on the sacred Shivaratri day on the Vedukkunni hill is reprehensible by the police.

### Gota’s book:  “Conspiracy Theory”  or Unintended Confession?

*2024-03-18 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gotas-book-Conspiracy-Theory-or-Unintended-Confession/172-279015) · `en`

This narrative underscores the importance of addressing deep-rooted  grievances and fostering inclusive governance to build trust and unity  across ethnic and religious lines.

The expulsion of Gotabaya by Aragalysts was a grassroots uprising against perceived authoritarianism and oppression, challenging his leadership rather than being a racially motivated act by non-Sinhala-Buddhists, as he pathetically attempts to portray in his conspiracy theory.

He began his term by taking positive steps, such as forbidding the display of his photograph in state institutions, reducing his security detail, and downsizing his motorcade from seven to three vehicles

Two years after his ouster from office by a people’s movement, former President Gotabaya has attempted to defend himself by attributing his political downfall to a “conspiracy” involving foreign parties.

### Salary hike of CBSL: Can it be justified on grounds of financial performance and position?

*2024-03-17 23:53:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Salary-hike-of-CBSL-Can-it-be-justified-on-grounds-of-financial-performance-and-position/4-759585) · `en`

The real bottom-line (i.e., profit or loss) of a Central Bank should be the ‘public good’ it has created

Accounting profit or loss cannot be used to evaluate the performance of CBSL. Even if CBSL has been making accounting profits, such profits cannot be used as an indicator of the contribution, efficiency, and overall performance of it. Therefore, such profits, even if they exist, cannot be used to justify a salary hike based on performance

The salary hike of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has been questioned and challenged on several grounds including constitutional, legal, economic, financial, and ethics.

### Demystification of the black box involving money creation by C.A. Abeysinghe

A demand deposit which the Central Bank maintains for a commercial bank in its books – another monetary liability – is paid back on demand when the bank concerned makes a written request to the Central Bank. The Central Bank may pay it by issuing a currency note – in which case the currency liability of the bank will increase – or by debiting that bank’s account and crediting another bank’s account. The Central Bank creates this reserve money just by making book entries and supplies to commercial banks as ‘seed money’ to facilitate them to create further money in multiple terms. Abeysinghe has described this process in lucid terms in the book

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin on Sunday accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ‘‘uttering a lie’’ on the Katchatheevu issue to target the DMK and blamed him for ‘‘staying silent’’ over projects for the state.

In a post on social media platform X, Stalin alleged that the Indian Prime Minister had ‘‘blatantly lied’’ in his rally at Kanyakumari on March 15 that Tamil Nadu fishermen are facing trouble from Sri Lanka only due to the past ‘‘sin’’ of the DMK.

‘‘The Tamil Nadu people know the true history pretty well; that the Katchatheevu island was ceded (1974, 1976 agreements) to Sri Lanka despite the stiff opposition of the DMK government. Is the Prime Minister naive to the extent of believing that a state government can give away a portion of the country to another country,’’ Stalin said in the post.

### Demystification Of The Black Box Involving Money Creation By C.A. Abeysinghe

With the increased cost of printing, many writers have turned to publishing e-books. They have a better storage facility in the clouds and offer a wider outreach anytime in any part of the globe. Cost-wise also they are economical for both the writer and the reader. The latest to join this bandwagon has been the ex-central banker, C.A. Abeysinghe, who has released his e-book on ‘Unveiling the Secrets: How money is created?’ recently. Anyone interested in downloading the book for reading can have it from the Ruhuna University Library Catalogue click here. The book, based on Abeysinghe’s long experience at the Central Bank, first as an economist and later as the man in charge of the implementation of the monetary policy, is timely. That is because though many speak of the Central Bank’s money printing power, their understanding of the subject at a deep level seems to be limited. Hence, Abeysinghe’s book can be used by those interested in monetary economics as a primer.

Roshan Ranzinghe, former Sports Minister, calls for the removal of elderly MPs, arguing for youth representation in Parliament. He criticizes the retirement of public servants and MPs, highlighting a lack of accountability and corruption, especially against those in power.

🟩

If this is the case, the entire parliament and the old slopes will become an old sloppy and that if the country is to be built, the elderly in Parliament should be expelled and the youth should be given the opportunity to give the youth a chance to give the youth the opportunity.

Former Sports Minister and Member of Parliament, Roshan Ranzinghe, has stressed the above when he went to worship him.

Public servants retire because they cannot work hard after reaching 60 years of age. But there are plenty of people who have been retiring in Parliament. Some retire from government service and come to parliament.

They have no choice of giving. He also said that they were struggling to come to Parliament. They have no feeling on the people of the country. They sell the country's resources and rejoice their generation
