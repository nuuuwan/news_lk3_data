    "It was, indeed, gratifying to have parents, especially mothers, contacting me and praising The Island for the article \u2018Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women\u2019s & Child Ministry\u2019.",
    "What\u2019s more, even AI (Artificial Intelligence) picked up the article and elaborated on it on AI Mode, and this is what AI created, with the headline \u2018Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women\u2019s & Child Ministry\u2019:",
    "\u201cAccording to an article in The Island, a Sri Lankan newspaper, the potential negative impacts of child beauty pageants on schoolchildren should be an eye-opener for the country\u2019s Women and Child Ministry. The article highlights concerns over the effects of intense competition on young children, calling for action from the Ministry and other authorities.",
    "\u2018Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women\u2019s & Child Ministry\u2019 (The Island, Thursday, 04 September, 2025) highlighted on AI Mode",
    "The article identifies several potential negative effects of child beauty pageants, fuelled by intense competition and pressure to win.",
    "* Mental health issues: Critics argue that the events can contribute to anxiety, depression, and stress.",
    "* Low self-worth: Placing high-value on physical appearance can lead to feelings of low self-worth in young participants.",
    "* Exploitation: The article implicitly raises concerns about potential harm and the need to protect children from exploitation.",
    "The author urges the Women\u2019s and Child Ministry to take immediate action to address these pressing issues, emphasising the following:",
    "* Collaboration: Authorities must work together to ensure the protection and well-being of Sri Lankan schoolchildren.",
    "* Parental vigilance: Parents are reminded that their child\u2019s safety is their responsibility and that they must remain cautious.",
    "* Regulatory focus: The piece mentions a global trend towards stricter regulations and increased awareness regarding the negative impact of such events on children.",
    "The article serves as a call for increased awareness and regulation surrounding child beauty pageants to protect the mental and emotional health of young participants.\u201d",
    "And \u2026 since these two letters make interesting reading, I thought of highlighting them, as well:",
    "Mrs. Somasundera: There are parents who put too much pressure on their children to win. Some of these kids hate doing pageants and are scared to go on stage, but the mothers force them out there, anyway. Obviously, these pageant mothers are more concerned about themselves than they are about their child\u2019s happiness. They\u2019re not entering pageants for the kids\u2014they\u2019re doing it for themselves.",
    "Mrs. Gamage: I do not support pageants for school-goers and I would never put my child in one. In my honest opinion, pageants for school-goers, and also modelling, are harmful to children.",
