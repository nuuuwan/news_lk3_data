    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka spends 4 billion rupees a year holding prisoners and is now planning to enact new house arrest legislation in 2024 as a solution to overcrowding in prisons, State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne said.",
    "Jayaratne told reporters on Thursday March 14 that the country\u2019s prison population stands at 30,793 individuals which far exceeds its capacity of 12,000.",
    "Amendments to laws such as the Bail Act are also being considered to address this, he said.",
    "A committee headed by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda had submitted a report on house arrest, after which cabinet approval was obtained for a draft bill which is now being formulated by the Legal Draftsman, according to Jayaratne.",
    "\u201cWe plan to present this house arrest bill to parliament in 2024 and make it a law. Consequent to this law, people convicted of civil offences can serve their sentence in their home instead of being imprisoned,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOur prison capacity is 12,000, but there are 30,793 at present in remand custody and as convicts. We expect there will be a solution to that through this.\u201d",
    "At a press conference in February, the state minister told reporters that 65 percent of prisoners were convicted for drug offenses and that government intended to rehabilitate them and provide them with some professional training.",
    "The highest number of drug inmates are in the Western and Southern provinces, the official data showed. (Colombo/Mar15/2024)"
