Elpitiya election results show dissatisfaction with current government. Opposition leader predicts similar outcome in parliamentary elections. President promises changes but acknowledges challenges in implementation. Opposition focuses on achievable goals rather than unrealistic promises. This sets stage for potential new government formation in upcoming parliamentary election.

🟩

Elpitiya election results reveal that people are dissatisfied with the current government. Velusamy Radhakrishnan, the leader of the Upcountry People's Front, the co -chair of the Tamil Progressive Alliance and the Nuwara Eliya district candidate of the United People's Alliance, said that this would happen in the parliamentary elections.

In the past, we have seen in the past that the presidential election in Sri Lankan politics is over and the president and his party will win all the next elections.

However, the president has been able to get more than 50 percent of the vote in the local government elections after the end of the presidential election.

The reason is that the president and the government are dissatisfied with the government.

The president said that he would make many changes in 48 hours if he came to power while in the party.. He said that many wonders have the ability to do with me and his crew. But now I am not a witch or a trick.

In the post-colonial era, many Asian nations sought strong leaders to guide them through the challenges of independence, economic development, and social transformation. Singapore found such a leader in Lee Kuan Yew, whose visionary leadership transformed the city-state from a resource-poor colony into a global economic powerhouse. Sri Lanka, however, has struggled to produce a leader with the same transformative impact. Despite its rich resources, strategic location, and potential, Sri Lanka has yet to find its equivalent of Lee Kuan Yew. This article explores why none of Sri Lanka’s political leaders have been able to replicate his success.

In today’s context, we observe a growing number of ex-military personnel, both officers and other ranks, transitioning into the employment world in Sri Lanka after completing their agreed service period.

### Managing conflicts of interest of political appointees and MPs

An inexperienced and understaffed Government is making appointments to various senior positions. To be true to their election promises, a process has been initiated to strip away various “privileges” given to holders of political office. What is common to both is the problem of managing conflicts of interest.

Concerns were raised when the CEO of a supermarket chain was appointed as chairman of Sathosa, the Government’s supermarket company. It cannot be because he lacks the necessary knowledge to run the business. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine a better qualified person to serve as CEO or as executive chair of the ailing SOE.

The interim NPP government wants to make negotiated changes to the IMF conditionalities already agreed upon by the previous regime. If that is not feasible, the NPP will have to move away from the thinking that any deviation from the IMF prescribed debt restructuring would further damage the country’s economy. Otherwise, the NPP will have to resort to other alternatives.

Furthermore, allegations are being made that the interim government has overborrowed during its first few weeks in office. The Central Bank has issued treasury bills of Rs. 465.1 billion from last September 27. However, the government has clarified that this is not a new or an additional loan.

### Around 40 killed in attack on Chad military base, presidency says

Around 40 soldiers were killed in an attack on a military base in Chad’s Lake region on Sunday, the central African country’s presidency said on Monday.

President Mahamat Idriss Deby launched an operation to track down the assailants, the statement said. It did not name the group responsible for the attack.

The Lake Chad region has been repeatedly attacked by insurgencies including by Islamic State in West Africa and Boko Haram, which erupted in northeast Nigeria in 2009 and spread to the west of Chad.

Chad is an important ally for French and U.S. forces aiming to fight jihadists in the Sahel, which has become the epicentre of global terrorism under attack by factions loyal to al Qaeda and Islamic State.

Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have ended military operations with the U.S. and France in recent years and turned to Russia for support instead.
