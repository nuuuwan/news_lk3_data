### சந்தையில் கீரி சம்பா அரிசி பற்றாக்குறை !

*2025-09-15 09:01:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225104) · `ta`

அரிசி உற்பத்தியாளர்கள் கீரி சம்பா அரிசியை விற்பனை செய்வதைத் தவிர்த்து வருவதாகவும், ஏனெனில் அவர்கள் கீரி சம்பாவிற்கு விதிக்கப்பட்ட கட்டுப்பாட்டு விலையான  260 ரூபாயை விட அதிகமான விலையில் வழங்குவதாகவும் புறக்கோட்டை அரிசி மொத்த விற்பனையாளர்கள் தெரிவித்துள்ளனர்.

இந்த சூழ்நிலையைக் கருத்தில் கொண்டு, சில்லறை விற்பனையாளர்களும் கீரி சம்பா அரிசியை விற்பனை செய்வதைத் தவிர்த்து வருகின்றனர்.

இத்தகைய சூழ்நிலையில், சம்பா மற்றும் கீரி சம்பா அரிசிக்கு விதிக்கப்பட்ட அதிகபட்ச சில்லறை விலையை நீக்குமாறு அரிசி உற்பத்தியாளர்கள் சங்கம் அரசாங்கத்திடம் கோரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ளது.

இருப்பினும், பெரிய அளவிலான அரிசி ஆலை உரிமையாளர்கள் செயற்கையான அரிசி பற்றாக்குறையை உருவாக்கி இலாபம் ஈட்ட முயற்சிப்பதால், அரிசியின் அதிகபட்ச சில்லறை விலையை நீக்க எந்த நடவடிக்கையும் எடுக்க வேண்டாம் என இலங்கை சிறு மற்றும் நடுத்தர அளவிலான நெல் ஆலை உரிமையாளர்கள் சங்கம் கோருகிறது.

இந்தநிலையில், அரசாங்கம் உடனடியாக இந்தப் பிரச்சினைக்கு தீர்வுகளை வழங்க வேண்டும் என தேசிய விவசாயிகள் சங்கம் கோரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ளது.

### பெருந்தோட்டத்துறையில் முதலாவது நவீன முன்பள்ளி

*2025-09-15 08:43:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/224917) · `ta`

பெருந்தோட்டத்துறையில் ஒரு புதிய வித்தியாசமான முயற்சியாக முதலாவது மாதிரி நவீன முன் பள்ளி ஒன்று உருவாக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. பலரும் வியக்கும் வகையில் இதற்கான ஏற்பாடுகள் சம்பந்தப்பட்ட தரப்பினரால் முன்னெடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளன.

மனித வாழ்வில் பிள்ளைப் பருவம் மிக முக்கியத்துவம் வாய்ந்ததொன்றாகக் கருதப்படுகின்றது. இந்தப் பருவத்திலேயே முக்கிய விருத்திகள் மேம்படுகின்றன. எனவே இதன் முக்கியத்துவத்தினை உணர்ந்து அனைவரும் இதில் கவனம் செலுத்தி பிள்ளைகளின் விருத்தி தொடர்பான செயற்பாடுகளுக்குத் துணை புரிவது மிகவும் அவசியமானதாகும்.

அந்த வகையில், முன்பள்ளிக் கல்வியானது பிள்ளைகளை ஆரம்பப் பாடசாலைகளுக்குச் செல்வதற்கு தயார் செய்கின்றது. முன்பள்ளியில் அவர்கள் பயிலும் விடயங்கள் ஆரம்பக் கல்வியை சீராகப் பயில்வதற்கு துணை செய்கின்றன.

இலங்கையில் பெருந்தோட்ட பிரதேசங்களில் பிள்ளைப்பருவக் கல்வியானது முறைமைப்படுத்தப்படாது காணப்படுகின்றது. பெரும்பாலான முன்பள்ளிகளில் அவற்றுக்குத் தேவையான அடிப்படையான வசதிகள் காணப்படுவதில்லை.

### Qatar PM urges world to ‘stop using double standards’ and punish Israel

Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani urged the international community on Sunday (Sep 14) to “stop using double standards” and punish Israel for what he described as its “crimes”.

“The time has come for the international community to stop using double standards and to punish Israel for all the crimes it has committed, and Israel needs to know that the ongoing war of extermination that our brotherly Palestinian people is being subjected to, and whose aim is to expel them from their land, will not work,” the prime minister said.

### Sri Lanka central bank buys US$781mn less to August 2025 than last year

*2025-09-15 05:30:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-buys-us781mn-less-to-august-2025-than-last-year-240490/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank bought 142.5 million US dollars from commercial banks in August 2025, taking the total so far this year to 1,238.6 million US dollars so far this year, official data show.

In 2024, the central bank bought 2020.4 million US dollars in the same period with stronger deflationary policy and lower private credit.

In late 2024 the central bank re-started inflationary policy through aggressive open market operations to mis-target the interbank rate, as private credit picked up, leading to sharply reduced collections in November and December.

However, in 2025, there was no inflationary policy per se, other than dollar-rupee buy-sell swaps. Dollar purchases were also unsterilized under the latest phase of the IMF program no longer requiring a sell down of CB held g-secs, which analysts say is a mistake.

### Repeal of Presidents’ Entitlements Act: Reform or retrospective punishment?

Three years ago, in 2022, inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index or CCPI was running on average at about 63% and the official exchange rate was unstable with a lucrative black market for foreign currencies. All indications were that Sri Lanka, unless proper policies would be adopted, would descend to a basket case like Lebanon. This did not happen because the central bank’s management, with financial as well as policy support of the International Monetary Fund or IMF, was able to tame the rising inflation and keep the exchange rate at a stable level

In a recent talk show titled ‘Modern Talk’ hosted by Channel 7 television, successor to the former YA Television, the young talk show hostess Nimna Perera asked me whether the current central bank management had been doing its job properly in managing the economy.1

Both students in Bangla and youth in Nepal were ultimately represented by small groups the military accepted and were projected as instruments of change

In Bangladesh and in Nepal, though with commonalities in the initial “leaderless” single issue protests, establishing a new rule was different to Sri Lanka and remains unconstitutional too. From nowhere a few youth in Bangladesh claiming to represent the university student protest and accepted as such by the military usurped the right to nominate Muhammud Yunus, the former head of the Grameen Bank as interim PM. He was in self-exile in France, and there were no indications of any discussions and dialogue among students and protesting groups, on who should head the interim government and how it should be constituted

In answering her question, I summarily told her that the central bank is an independent organisation as mandated by the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act or CBA and, under the mandate given to it by the new legislation, it is doing perfectly well in taming inflation and restoring the stability of the exchange rate. However, it requires further elaboration.

### Importance Of Sri Lankan Studies In School & University Curricula: A Justice-Oriented Civic Transformation

The Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka has announced a national education reform initiative scheduled for implementation in 2026. Within this context, this paper argues for the integration of Sri Lankan Studies as a compulsory subject at both secondary and tertiary levels of education. The rationale derives from comparative international experiences where structured national studies such as American Studies, Chinese Studies, and Russian Studies are institutionalized to cultivate civic consciousness, strengthen national identity, and enhance democratic participation. Sri Lanka, despite its complex postcolonial trajectory and protracted ethnic conflict, lacks a coherent academic framework that synthesizes its history, cultural plurality, political institutions, and developmental challenges. Existing subjects such as Civic Education remain fragmented, outdated, and inadequate in fostering justice-oriented citizenship.

Sri Lanka’s foremost biodiversity scientist, Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, describes this country as “a veritable Garden of Eden for evolutionary scientists.” Speaking to The Sunday Island, he warned that while the country remains rich in natural heritage, the threats are mounting fast.

“We now have more alien species in our waters than endemic ones. There’s no longer an ‘if’ about extinction—it’s a matter of ‘when’. And we’re doing very little about it,” he stressed.

Dr. Pethiyagoda and Hiranya Sudasinghe with Dr Maurice Kottelat, the Swiss Ichthyologist, who, in the late 1980s, mentored Pethiyagoda in the study of fishes.

Winner of the Linnean Medal and the Rolex Award, Dr. Pethiyagoda has devoted decades to documenting Sri Lanka’s freshwater fishes and other fauna. In this exclusive conversation with The Sunday Island’s Ifham Nizam, he reflects on evolution, science, and the looming challenges for conservation.

### ADB’s water brings life to Vavuniya, but affordability crisis looms for the poor

*2025-09-14 17:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/adbs-water-brings-life-to-vavuniya-but-affordability-crisis-looms-for-the-poor/) · `en`

For the women of Vavuniya’s rural outskirts, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) didn’t just lay pipes; it gifted them time. It returned to them the hours once spent in a daily, desperate pilgrimage for water.

Before 2009, their lives were defined by the walk to the well – a journey that often ended in disappointment, with dry pumps and empty pots. Their children, parched, sometimes missed school. Their husbands, daily-wage labourers earning a median of Rs. 2,000 a day, left for work with anxiety weighing as heavy as the tropical sun.

Today, the turn of a tap brings a clean, steady flow, a miracle made possible by the ADB’s $40 million investment under the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project. This ambitious scheme replaced a defunct system, constructing a new dam and a modern treatment plant that now delivers safe, potable water to 80,000 people. The physical transformation is undeniable; a feat of engineering that ended a decades-long water crisis.

### Bond standoff: Banks swim in cash but shun government debt

*2025-09-14 17:34:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/bond-standoff-banks-swim-in-cash-but-shun-government-debt/) · `en`

A standoff is brewing between Sri Lanka’s monetary authority and bond market participants, as cash-rich banks show a reluctant appetite for government securities. This was evident in the September 11, 2025 Treasury bond auction, where the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raised only a portion of its targeted funds, with a significant shortfall in a key maturity.

This caution exists alongside signs of economic resilience. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew 6.4% year-on-year in July 2025, driven by surges in petroleum refining (166.7%), apparel manufacturing (16.2%), and non-metallic mineral products (15.9%).

Amid this growth, the banking sector is flush with cash. Total outstanding market liquidity swelled to a surplus of Rs. 178.58 billion by September 12, 2025. However, this liquidity is not flowing aggressively into government bonds.
