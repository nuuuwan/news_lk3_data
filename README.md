### Minister issues scathing response to Ranil‚Äôs statement on liquor licenses

*2024-12-10 16:26:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104144/minister-issues-scathing-response-to-ranils-statement-on-liquor-licenses) ¬∑ `en`

The Cabinet Media Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, announced that liquor companies owe nearly Rs. 7 billion in taxes, and that the government is taking measures to recover the outstanding dues.

Dr. Jayatissa‚Äôs comments came in response to the statement issued by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äôs office on December 09. The statement claimed that Wickremesinghe had not granted any liquor licenses outside the prescribed procedure and emphasized that the government had generated over Rs. 3 billion in revenue by granting liquor licenses.

Addressing the matter today, Minister Jayatissa stated: ‚ÄúFormer President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he hoped to strengthen the temperance movement by issuing 250 to 300 liquor licenses per year and using the taxes generated from them. It is not appropriate for a person who spends his retirement life on the public tax money to express his views in such a sarcastic manner.‚Äù

### Book industry renews call for exemption from VAT, citing serious concerns

Sri Lanka‚Äôs book industry has renewed its call for books to be exempt from tax, with four industry bodies submitting a proposal to the new government for inclusion in the next national budget.

Urging the government to consider the financial as well as social ramifications of taxing sources of knowledge and learning, these associations representing publishers, writers, retailers, importers and exporters have called for books to be returned to the list of items exempt from tax, as was the case before January 1, 2024.

In their proposal, the four associations pointed out that with all inputs for the publishing industry with the exception of local labour being imported, Sri Lanka‚Äôs book industry is already taxed at 33.045%, and the imposition of a value-added tax (VAT) of 18% at the point of sale has made books unaffordable to many, and is putting small-scale publishers out of business.

On the 10th of December, the International Human Rights Day, a protest march in Vavuniya staged a rally in Vavuniya.

The rally, which began in front of the Kandaswamy Temple in Vavuniya, ended at the old bus station.

The world is celebrated today (10) as the International Human Rights Day. The international and the international are not seen as human beings as they abandoned Eelam Tamils

No rights were granted. Will we get international justice?We are struggling on this day with the question

In the absence of confidence in the domestic mechanism, we are seeking an international justice mechanism under the United Nations under the United Nations International Charter.

Our relationships are the ones who have disappeared!They are not missing. Today, Sri Lanka ranks first in the international rank in the missing session.

The plane crashed into the seven virgin of the Nordon Bridge, which departed from Indonesia's Surabaya International Airport.

The plane, which was traveling to Makkah, crashed into a mountain that was found among heavy forests.

Following a technical failure on the plane, which was flying over 36,000 meters, the pilot was alleged that the pilot had brought the aircraft below 4000 meters at the behest of the aircraft.

However, as the plane that was traveling above the Bogawantalawa Casalry reservoir was traveling to the height of the air, one of its wings fell into the mountain.

Those who visited the site of the accident still carry the tragic memories of the accident.

They share memories of the day that 'the body of the airplane was identified by her boyfriend and her body was taken to Indonesia.'

Sri Lanka Speaker Ashoka Ranwala's educational qualifications disputed. Website removes "Dr." title. Former Election Commissioner challenges doctorate claim. Cabinet spokesperson promises response to allegations.

üü©

Amidst allegations of Speaker Ashoka Ranwala's educational qualification, the Sri Lankan parliamentary website has removed the term 'kalanidhi' from his profile.

Previously, it was referred to as 'Dr.' Azoka Ranwala, and now his name appears to be the Ashoka Ranwala MP, which raises further doubts about whether he is legal.

From the profile of the Speaker. 'It has been reported that the website has been renewed within the last 24 hours to remove the title of 'Dr.'.

However, archived versions and Google search results will still show the topic, while it cannot be added to the current profile.

The controversy erupted after social media enthusiasts questioned their credentials on their Facebook, which led to general calls for accountability.

Former Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has also challenged the Speaker's doctorate to prove the title.

Deshapriya also urged the national people to take power if the Speaker did not respond.

Corruption could be defined as the abuse of power for private gains. Quite often political leaders and public officers are implicated in acts of corruption.

Corruption takes place at different levels and scales. It ranges from taking bribes to financial-administrative corruption which involves abuse of public offices to derive private gains. The highest scale of corruption or grand corruption usually takes place at top level of public sector hierarchy with possible involvement of business giants and political heavyweights. The infamous central Bank Bond Scam is an example of a grand corruption.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks.

Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying.

Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing.

In November the central bank bought 374 million US dollars from banks, data showed.

Concerns have been raised over recent cash injected through domestic operations (open market operations) at a time when money is already created over international operations, to closely target a policy rate with excess liquidity.
