    "The air quality levels have dropped in Colombo and several other areas across the country, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) said.",
    "Furthermore, the individuals who are experiencing respiratory difficulties are advised to seek immediate medical attention.",
    "According to the daily air quality report of NBRO\u2019s Environmental Studies and Services Division, the Sri Lanka Air Quality Index (SLAQI) is expected to range between 92 and 120 throughout the day, as a result of the prevailing weather conditions and a border disturbance from the north.",
    "While this range falls within the \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cslightly harmful\u201d categories, several urban areas are projected to reach unhealthy levels, as per the NBRO.",
    "Meanwhile in Colombo, the air quality is forecasted to range between 108 and 116, while Jaffna and Polonnaruwa are expected to record even higher levels, between 112 and 120 within the day.",
    "Other cities, including Kurunegala, Vavuniya, Kandy, Kegalle, Galle, Badulla, and Trincomalee, are also predicted to exceed a value of 100 on the SLAQI, signaling air quality that could pose health concerns for sensitive groups.",
    "The NBRO advises individuals, especially those with respiratory or heart conditions, to monitor their health closely and seek medical advice if they experience breathing difficulties.",
    "In the meantime, a few locations, including Nuwara Eliya, Embilipitiya, Kalutara, Hambantota, and Monaragala, are expected to maintain moderate air quality levels (51-100).",
    "The AQI (Air Quality Index), used to communicate to the general public the daily air quality, is based on the measurement of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. An AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality, as per international standards."
