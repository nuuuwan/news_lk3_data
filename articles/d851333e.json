    "Sri Lanka is set to introduce a new tax on homeowners as part of a wider effort to boost Government revenue. This levy, known as the Imputed Rental Income Tax (IRIT), will extend to both owner-occupied and vacant residential property. The tax burden will be determined by the deemed rental income these homeowners could generate if they rented out their homes.",
    "While the IRIT is expected to bring in new revenue for the Government, whether this will translate into significant revenue generation is still uncertain. The IMF Staff Level Report, published recently, recommends seeking the Parliamentary approval of revenue measures for the 2025 Budget ahead of the Presidential Elections. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to expedite preparatory work for the IRIT\u2019s implementation before the beginning of the tax year, April 2025.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s housing policy strives to achieve shelter for all by 2025. However, the proposed IRIT may inadvertently create a disincentive for homeownership, potentially undermining the very goal of the housing policy. Hence, the IRIT brings about a clear contradiction between Sri Lanka\u2019s housing policy and tax policy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s tax system adheres to the principle of taxation on realized income. This means that taxpayers are generally liable for taxes only on income they have actually earned, not on potential future earnings. Exceptionally, the tax laws outline specific instances where income tax applies to unrealized income.",
    "The concept of \u201cimputed income\u201d is the focal point of IRIT, which mandates the payment of taxes on income that may never materialize. In simpler terms, taxpayers would be liable for taxes on a fictional/ hypothetical income, not on actual earnings they receive. Taxation ideally reflects the economic realities of income generation. If income isn\u2019t received, the burden of taxation on such \u201cimputed income\u201d can create a significant financial strain for taxpayers.",
    "Income tax operates on a clear principle: individuals receive income and contribute a share to the State through tax payments. However, the IRIT introduces a novel concept \u2013 taxation on \u201cimaginary income\u201d. The potential disconnect between this imaginary income and the taxpayer\u2019s financial reality sparks debate about the fairness and equitability of the IRIT.",
    "It is worth noting that a similar tax (Net Annual Value concept) was previously included in the Inland Revenue Act. No. 10 of 2006. Under this regime, the \u201cnet annual value of not more than one place of residence, owned by and occupied by or on behalf of an individual\u201d was exempt and the assessed values for rating purposes were used to determine the base. The concept of Net Annual Value extended to land and improvements thereon.",
    "The concept of taxing the potential rental income, or \u201cimputed rent,\u201d on owner-occupied properties is rare, and it is only implemented by a select few OECD nations: Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.",
    "According to Swiss tax law, a resident taxpayer owning a house or an apartment and living in this house or apartment is generally taxed on the deemed rental value of this property, which will be added to the individual\u2019s taxable income.",
    "In order to determine the imputed rental value of a home, Swiss authorities consider several factors such as the property value (including land and construction costs), living space, age, and location. The tax administration in the Canton of residence then compares or estimates how much rent a similar property costs. Generally, the imputed rental value falls between 60% and 70% of the potential rental income.",
    "While both Greece and Sri Lanka faced economic challenges necessitating IMF intervention, their approaches to taxation differ. Greece imposed an imputed income tax on luxury living such as private cars with large engine power, airplanes, helicopters, swimming pools as well as private yachts/boats exceeding five meters. In contrast, Sri Lanka is set to implement IRIT primarily targeting homeowners.",
    "Understanding the Rationale for IRIT in Switzerland and other similar nations",
    "The rationale behind the IRIT implemented in Switzerland centres on achieving tax parity between homeowners and renters.",
    "Traditionally, renters pay tax on their income but cannot deduct their rent payments, a significant expense. Conversely, homeowners can deduct mortgage interest and maintenance costs from their taxable income, reducing their overall tax burden. This tax system that favoured homeowners over renters, created a disparity. The introduction of the IRIT aimed to rectify this imbalance by imposing a tax on imputed rental income of homeowners.",
    "As a means of achieving the objective of creating tax parity, when IRIT was introduced, homeowners were allowed to deduct certain expenses such as maintenance costs and mortgage interest expenses in order to offset the imputed income charge.",
    "Given the absence of deductions for mortgage interest and maintenance expenses for homeowners in Sri Lanka, unlike Switzerland that has introduced IRIT, the rationale behind Sri Lanka\u2019s implementation of IRIT becomes questionable. Maybe if IRIT is to be implemented, policymakers should provide a deduction for mortgage interest and maintenance expenses to Sri Lankan taxpayers.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s tax landscape regarding deductions for expenses incurred by homeowners, has undergone several changes over the years, with amendments to income tax laws. The previous Inland Revenue Act (No. 10 of 2006) allowed deductions for capital repayments and interest payments on approved housing loans obtained before 01 April 2011. The subsequent Inland Revenue Act (No. 24 of 2017) introduced an expenditure relief for interest on housing loans. However, this relief was abolished in December 2022. Consequently, the current tax system in Sri Lanka offers no deductions for either housing loan interest or any other housing-related costs.",
    "Unlike countries like Switzerland, since there is no deduction currently available for homeowners in Sri Lanka, there is no disparity between homeowners and renters. Therefore, implementing IRIT in Sri Lanka without allowing deductions may end up creating a disparity and this would discourage the concept of homeownership, and favour living in rented houses.",
    "Therefore, to mitigate potential inequities arising from the implementation of IRIT in Sri Lanka, policymakers should consider establishing an allowance for deductions such as mortgage interest, maintenance cost and similar expenses as referred to above. This would ensure a level playing field and achieve true tax neutrality for homeowners. Without such deductions for mortgage interest and maintenance costs, homeowners would shoulder a disproportionate tax burden.",
    "Recent comments made by policymakers in Sri Lanka in relation to the implementation of IRIT as per the IMF Report, suggests that the focus of IRIT is on high wealth individuals, and not on average income earners. Further, policymakers have indicated that an exemption would be granted for primary residences.",
    "The \u201cNet Annual Value\u201d concept in the IRA 2006, is criticized in the IMF report for its reliance on exemptions (such as exempting the primary residence) and the use of assessed values. The IMF report also states that IRIT would be implemented with an exemption threshold and a graduated tax rate schedule, which would make this tax highly progressive. However, there is no indication whatsoever in the IMF report with regard to the \u201cfirst house exemption.\u201d Nonetheless, it is very likely that a first house exemption would be included when the law is being passed.",
    "Granting a first-house exemption, while potentially appealing to some taxpayers, may undermine the revenue targets associated with the IRIT. The IMF report estimates that the IRIT should contribute 0.15% to Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP. However, a broad exemption for primary residences could significantly reduce the IRIT tax base, posing a challenge for the Government in achieving its projected revenue goals.",
    "Despite the ambiguities surrounding the implementation of the IRIT, the use of fictional income for taxation would surely create a significant change to the existing taxing mechanism used in Sri Lanka\u2019s tax framework. Moreover, this approach will impose a substantial financial burden on taxpayers as they will be taxed on imputed, rather than actual earnings.",
