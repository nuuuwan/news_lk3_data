  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Court of Appeal has overturned the order issued by the Director General of Health which suspended Kidney Transplant surgery at the Western Infirmary Hospital, the Island\u2019s first and oldest Kidney Transplanting hospital.",
    "In December 2022, the Director General of Health suspended all transplant surgeries at the hospital following allegations of an ongoing kidney racket involving the institution.",
    "The hospital has consistently denied the allegations, contending that ulterior motives drove the media frenzy. They asserted that their initiative to resume kidney transplant surgeries for foreigners aimed at generating foreign revenue and that the accusations were orchestrated to hinder the hospital\u2019s surgical activities.",
    "The Court of Appeal, led by Justice Bandula Karunarathne and Justice Ahsan Marikkar, delivered its final judgment on Friday, ruling that the suspension of kidney transplant surgery at the hospital by the Director General of Health, based on the reports, was illegal. The court therefore quashed the decision.",
    "Presidents Counsel Faizer Musthapha PC, along with Shaeeda Barrie, Hafeel Farisz and Ridmi Beneragama, represented the petitioner hospital, while Deputy Solicitor General Vikum De Abrew appeared for the Health Ministry officials."
