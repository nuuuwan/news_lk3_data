  "original_body_lines": [
    "The stunning electoral sweep of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is \u201can earthquake in Sri Lankan politics\u201d, says Erik Solheim, the former Norwegian peace facilitator in the island nation.",
    "The former diplomat also feels that the strong showing by the NPP in areas populated by Tamils, particularly in the north, marked \u201ca very strong call for a new start in ethnic relations in Sri Lanka\u201d.",
    "Solheim, who has interacted closely with many Sri Lankan leaders, however, warned that while the NPP\u2019s inner core \u201cis for sure non-corrupt, eradicating corruption is a huge task\u201d.",
    "Solheim, now a committed green activist, piloted the Western-backed peace process which led to a historic pact between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in early 2002.",
    "But the process collapsed, triggering a renewed war four years later that led to the decimation in 2009 of the LTTE and the annihilation of virtually its entire leadership including founder-leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.",
    "A former leader of the Socialist Left Party in Norway, Solheim remains a keen follower of developments in Sri Lanka, where he once came under attack from sections of the majority Sinhalese community for allegedly being pro-LTTE, a charge he has repeatedly denied.",
    "In an email interview with The Federal from China which he frequently visits, Solheim said he did expect the NPP \u201cto be very successful\u201d in the November 14 elections but \u201ctheir sweeping victory was even bigger than I (expected)\u201d.",
    "He added: \u201cIt is an earthquake in Sri Lankan politics. For the first time, Sri Lankans elected a president and a party from outside the Colombo establishment, the son of a labourer in Anuradhapura.\u201d",
    "He said the voters, particularly the less privileged, were angry over corruption, felt that the traditional elite had not represented them well, and were upset they had to cut meals following the economic collapse of 2022.",
    "Solheim said that while individually many\u00a0 traditional Sri Lankan leaders were very nice, \u201cas a class they have failed Sri\u00a0 Lanka and made the nation underperform compared to say Singapore, Vietnam,\u00a0 Malaysia or Tamil Nadu\u201d.",
    "Is Tamil voting for NPP a rejection of Tamil nationalist politics?",
    "For this, he blamed narrow ethnic appeals that led to a prolonged war \u2013 \u201cand no country marches forward in the midst of a civil war\u201d. There was also little ability to formulate a winning economic policy for growth and poverty alleviation.",
    "Solheim said the unexpected scale of electoral support to the NPP \u2013 a party otherwise rooted in Sinhalese regions \u2013 in Tamil areas was \u201can astonishing vote of confidence from many Tamils\u201d in the Left-of-Centre party. \u201cI believe it represents a strong desire for peace and normalcy in the north and east. It also comes from a trust that the current NPP is not the same as the JVP (Janatha Vimukti Peramuna, People\u2019s Liberation Front) of the past.\u201d",
    "The NPP, whose core strength comes from the leftist JVP, won a whopping 159 seats in the 225-seat parliament, decimating a divided Opposition. It also picked up seats in the Tamil-majority north and the multi-racial eastern province.",
    "Asked if the Tamil voting for the NPP was a rejection of the Tamil nationalist politics, Solheim said: \u201cIt is a very strong call for a new start in ethnic relations. If the NPP is able to deliver for Tamils and keep their support, it represents a historic shift.\u201d",
    "The NPP victory in Tamil areas is considered significant as the JVP, the party\u2019s dominant constituent, opposed devolution of power to the Tamil region, stood for a unitary state, and got the once united north-eastern province de-merged into two \u2013 all to the chagrin of traditional Tamil politicians.",
    "The Norwegian, a former Undersecretary General in the United Nations (UN), said the new government\u2019s priority would be to negotiate a better deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and to formulate a winning strategy for economic growth with a fairer deal for the poor.",
    "Solheim added that the NPP\u2019s performance \u2013 it also\u00a0 won the presidency in September \u2013 showed that the Left can win elections if\u00a0 they put Left-wing sectarianism aside and come up with a policy with a broad\u00a0 mass appeal.",
    "\u201c(Dissanayake) embodied this with his inclusive approach. Left-wing parties with old-fashioned ideas don\u2019t win elections,\u201d he said, pointing to the electoral rout of the once powerful Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal.",
    "\u201cIf AKD (Dissanayake) like (President) Lula (da\u00a0 Silva) of Brazil introduces policies for the poor while at the same time working\u00a0 closely with business, the NPP can stay in power for long. It\u2019s too early to tell whether we have experienced\u00a0 a new epoch in Sri Lankan politics or just a change of government for five\u00a0 years. This is the chance for the NPP to establish themselves as a long-term\u00a0 ruling entity with the capacity for a big shift in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "Solheim, who often met LTTE leaders including Prabhakaran, reiterated his view that a peace deal could have been found in Sri Lanka in 2002-04. \u201cUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t succeed... The result was the loss of tens of thousands of lives, mainly Tamils but also many Sinhalese. The war of course also brought huge economic hardship to all communities. Sri Lanka was once the shining star in Asia which nearly every other nation wanted to emulate. Now Sri Lanka needs sustained green economic growth for a number of years to catch up with many neighbours.\u201d",
    "Does he, as a Sri Lanka watcher, have a message for President Dissanayake?",
    "\u201cMy advice is to focus on economic and ethnic inclusivity. Uplifting the poor is important for all ethnic groups. Added, AKD should respond favourably to the call from Tamils and Muslims for equal rights and self-government,\u201d he said."
