    "ECONMYNEXT \u2013 S&P Global Ratings said it is upgrading Pakistan\u2019s sovereign rating from CCC+ to B- on improved budgets and assurances that the country will be able to roll-over maturing debt.",
    "\u201cThe stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilize fiscal and debt metrics,\u201d S&P said.",
    "\u201cWe also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.",
    "\u201cDownward pressure would emerge if financial support from key bilateral and multilateral partners quickly erodes.\u201d",
    "On July 24, 2025, S&P Global Ratings raised its long-term sovereign credit ratings on Pakistan to \u2018B-\u2018 from \u2018CCC+\u2019, and its short-term ratings to \u2018B\u2019 from \u2018C\u2019. The outlook on the long-term rating is stable.",
    "At the same time, we revised our transfer & convertibility assessment to \u2018B-\u2018 from \u2018CCC+\u2019.",
    "The stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilize fiscal and debt metrics. We also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.",
    "We may lower our ratings if Pakistan\u2019s external or fiscal indicators deteriorate well beyond their current levels. Downward pressure would emerge if financial support from key bilateral and multilateral partners quickly erodes, or usable foreign exchange reserves fall substantially to levels indicating difficulties in servicing its external debt obligations. Furthermore, should interest rates surge again and materially add to the government\u2019s already-heavy debt servicing burden, we would view that as an indication of domestic financing stress.",
    "We may raise our ratings if institutional and political settings in Pakistan improve such that entrenched economic reforms bring about a sustained period of steady growth and fiscal consolidation. This will result in the economy outperforming our expectations, strengthening the country\u2019s fiscal and external positions more quickly than forecast.",
    "The ratings upgrade reflects our view that Pakistan is now less reliant upon favorable macroeconomic and financial developments to meet its obligations. Pakistan has replenished its foreign reserves over the last 12 months and near-term default risks have abated.",
    "The passage of the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) US$7 billion program for Pakistan in September 2024 has been instrumental in restoring much needed macroeconomic stability to the country. The IMF program, along with strong support from bilateral partners, has boosted foreign reserves considerably. At the time of our downgrade of Pakistan to \u2018CCC+\u2019 in December 2022, foreign reserves had plummeted to a multi-year low of US$6.7 billion. As of July 4, 2025, foreign reserves (including the central bank\u2019s gold holdings) have climbed to US$20.5 billion, sufficient to cover the government\u2019s external principal and interest payments of US$13.4 billion for fiscal 2026 (July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026).",
    "Pakistan\u2019s current account posted a surplus in fiscal 2025, the first time in 14 years. The small annual surplus of 0.5% of GDP was driven by record-high remittances totaling US$39 billion (9.5% of GDP) over the period. In all, these developments have strengthened Pakistan\u2019s external metrics and alleviated near-term external stress.",
    "The IMF program-related reforms have significantly increased the government\u2019s tax revenues by as much as 3% of GDP in the last 12 months. Alongside expenditure controls, we forecast general government deficit to decrease to 5.1% of GDP in fiscal 2026 from 7.9% in fiscal 2022.",
    "With inflation having subsided from a peak of 29% in fiscal 2023, we envisage Consumer Price Index (CPI) growth to average 6.5% over the next two to three years. As a result, monetary conditions will further ease and with lower domestic interest rates, the government\u2019s interest payments will decrease to average 41% of revenue over the next three years from a peak of above 60% in fiscal 2024. Nevertheless, Pakistan\u2019s interest servicing-to-revenue ratio remains one of the highest globally among rated sovereigns.",
    "Institutional and economic profile: Economic growth to resume on easing inflation but against a challenging backdrop of fractious politics.",
    "\u2022 Pakistan\u2019s economy grew in fiscal 2025 for a second consecutive year, following a contraction in fiscal 2023.",
    "\u2022 Alleviated inflationary pressures alongside IMF program reforms will support growth, which we project at 3.6% in fiscal 2026.",
    "\u2022 The government\u2019s reform efforts may face volatile social and political resistance toward austerity and tax enhancing measures.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s economy grew 2.7% in fiscal 2025 on the back of industry and services sector growth. This was counterbalanced by underwhelming agriculture sector growth, a critical sector accounting for 24% of economic output, affected by low crop yields from adverse weather conditions. We project GDP growth to improve in the current fiscal year to 3.6%, as reform measures and decline in prices lift economic activity.",
    "Inflationary pressures have subsided notably over the last year, thereby supporting the fiscal consolidation measures of the government. CPI growth came in at 4.5% for fiscal 2025, substantially lower than the 23.4% in the previous fiscal year.",
    "The Pakistani rupee\u2019s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in recent years has contributed to a sustained stagnation in the country\u2019s nominal GDP per capita. That said, the rupee has stabilized in the last fiscal year. Coupled with rising real growth, we forecast GDP per capita will rise just above US$2,000 in fiscal 2027.",
    "Pakistan and the IMF agreed to an EFF that approved financial support of US$7 billion in September 2024 over 37 months. The performance requirements of the program are a continuation and extension of those set in the US$3 billion Stand-By-Arrangement with the IMF, which the government completed in April 2024.",
    "The IMF completed the first review of Pakistan\u2019s EFF-tied economic reform program in May 2025. The meeting of the program targets facilitated a disbursement of US$1 billion, bringing total disbursement to date to US$2.1 billion. At the same time, the IMF approved the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to Pakistan, with access of US$1.4 billion. The EFF and RSF run concurrently over 37 months and give the country a total package of US$8.4 billion. In our view, these disbursements, in combination with new and rollover of deposits from bilateral partners, have helped to rebuild Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves from critical lows.",
    "We expect political uncertainty to remain high owing to a fractious political environment. Formed in the aftermath of the February 2024 general elections, the coalition government led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party has so far demonstrated its ability to navigate the necessary reform implementation under the IMF program without significant social unrest. The willingness of policymakers to stay the course of expenditure controls while making continued enhancements to the tax revenue base will be critical in meeting the remaining targets set out in the EFF.",
    "Pakistani politics has been in a state of flux since the ouster of former Prime Minister Imran Khan of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party in a parliamentary no-confidence motion in April 2022. The political turmoil hampered the government\u2019s efforts to deal with economic challenges previously, damaging the sovereign credit metrics. We believe a stable political environment in Pakistan is an important precondition to further improvements in the government\u2019s creditworthiness.",
    "The ratings on Pakistan remain constrained by elevated domestic and external security risks. The country\u2019s security situation has improved since the early 2010s, but the potential to deteriorate remains. Border tensions with India, as evident in the recent outbreak of hostilities in the wake of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May 2025, can raise the specter of miscalculations and accidental clashes that could escalate well beyond the intentions of both sides. Such a scenario would materially worsen credit risks.",
    "Flexibility and performance profile: Fiscal settings have benefited from tax reforms alongside rebuilding of external buffers from foreign inflows.",
    "\u2022 Bilateral and multilateral aid has shored up usable foreign exchange reserves, following a steep decline in fiscal 2023.",
    "\u2022 Continued support and rollovers of existing credit facilities will be important to maintain the accumulation of external buffers.",
    "\u2022 Interest costs continue to consume an enormous proportion of government receipts.",
    "The pressures on Pakistan\u2019s fiscal and external positions have lessened, a contrast from the conditions in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Under the IMF program reforms, the government has implemented a series of measures to expand the tax base. This includes tax initiatives like the Agriculture Income Tax and the widening of the tax net to bring in more registrants in the retail sector. These efforts have led to a significant increase of government revenue by three percentage points of GDP over the last 12 months. General government revenue to GDP reached 15.7% in fiscal 2025, an all-time high, from 12.6% the year before. As a result, the fiscal deficit has narrowed to 5.6% of GDP in fiscal 2025 from 7.9% in fiscal 2022.",
    "We believe the government will face political and social pushback in trimming its deficits any quicker. In the recently passed fiscal 2026 budget, the government has set a target to cut the budget deficit to 3.9% of GDP. We forecast the general government\u2019s fiscal 2026 deficit to decline less steeply to 5.1%. As a result, Pakistan\u2019s average annual change in net general government debt will average 5.1% of GDP from fiscal 2025 through to fiscal 2028.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s net debt stock is likely to remain fairly high at over 60% of GDP. But the main pressure on debt sustainability is the extremely high interest expense relative to fiscal revenue. This is a major constraint on our assessment of the government\u2019s debt burden. That said, we anticipate lower funding costs and a stable rupee to gradually bring down this ratio to 45.8% in the current fiscal year from 49% the prior year.",
    "The government\u2019s hefty interest burden arose from historically high domestic interest rates. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) undertook aggressive monetary policy tightening to tame surging inflation of over 20% annually during fiscal years 2023 and 2024. With inflationary expectations better anchored, the SBP has reduced the policy rate by 1,100 basis points since June 2024 to the current 11%. Consequently, the government, which had eschewed long-term debt issuance during the period of high rates, started to reprofile its debt stock from short-term paper to longer dated bonds.",
    "Inflows of external financial aid helped stabilize the country\u2019s external position in fiscal 2025. Support from bilateral creditors, including China, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait has been critical to Pakistan to meet its high external financing needs. The total support from these four partners in the form of central bank deposits and swaps reached US$16.8 billion as of end-fiscal 2025; we add this sum to the government\u2019s total stock of debt. Unless there is a sustained period of strong balance-of-payments performance to add to foreign reserves, we envisage Pakistan to have to continue to rely heavily on the renewal of existing bilateral credit and commercial loan facilities, as well as on the potential extension of new ones.",
    "The progress of the IMF program had drawn in other multilateral and bilateral financiers to resume their aid to Pakistan. In January 2025, the World Bank approved a 10-year Country Partnership Framework with Pakistan, committing US$20 billion in funding. Nevertheless, additional deposits or loans from external partners would further add to Pakistan\u2019s substantial narrow net external debt position. We forecast it to reach 128% of current account receipts by the end of this fiscal year.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s current account recorded a small surplus of 0.5% of GDP in fiscal 2025, underpinned by robust growth in remittances. This is against the backdrop of elevated current account deficits in the last few years, particularly the high shortfall of 4.7% of GDP in fiscal 2022. Despite our expectation of current account deficits to be modest at an average 0.8% of GDP from fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2028, Pakistan\u2019s continued external debt maturities will place sustained pressure on its foreign exchange reserves, absent considerable net new funding. Consequently, gross external financing needs, as well as net external indebtedness, will remain high over the next one to two years.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s banking system is modest by international standards. Total bank assets comprise about 54% of GDP. S&P Global Ratings does not publish a Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment on Pakistan.",
    "Despite the banking system\u2019s large exposure to the sovereign, it is, in our opinion, stable, liquid, and adequately capitalized. Combining our view of Pakistan\u2019s government-related entities and its financial system, we assess the country\u2019s contingent fiscal risks as limited. That said, Pakistan\u2019s banking system bears an outsized exposure to the sovereign, which accounts for more than half of scheduled banks\u2019 total outstanding credit.",
    "In 2022, Pakistan amended the SBP Act, which affords additional independence to the central bank, in line with IMF program objectives. We believe the SBP\u2019s autonomy and performance have strengthened since the establishment of a monetary policy committee for rate-setting in January 2016. Total SBP holdings of government securities have fallen slightly over the past three years as the central bank has stopped providing new financing to the government. This has strengthened the central bank\u2019s capacity to focus on fighting inflation, in our view."
