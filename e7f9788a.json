    "Initial data shows that lightning strikes on the Kotmale to Biyagama transmission line had caused the island-wide power breakdown yesterday (Dec. 09), a spokesman for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said.",
    "However, Speaking during today\u2019s parliamentary session, State Minister of Power and Energy Indika Anuruddha stated that two separate inquiries would be carried out by the Ministry of Power and Energy and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) into the island-wide power breakdown that occurred yesterday (09).",
    "Major power outages were reported across the island last evening, where the CEB, the country\u2019s power monopoly attributed it to a breakdown in the transmission line from Kotmale to Biyagama.",
    "Meanwhile, the water supply in several areas was either disrupted or supplied at low-pressure due to the power outages. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said it managed to restore the water supply in the affected localities within a few hours.",
    "Nevertheless, the Railways Department said train operations remained uninterrupted by the island-wide power outages.",
    "The Mahaweli Authority said several sluice gates of Polgolla, Victoria, Randenigala and Rantembe reservoirs were opened as a result of the situation.",
    "Such major power outages were first reported in March 2016. In August 2020, a 6-hour sudden power outage occurred due to a breakdown in the transmission lines in Kerawalapitiya.",
    "In addition, in December 2021, the electricity supply was disrupted due to a technical fault in the Kothmale and Biyagama transmission system. Following each of these cases, the authorities had taken steps to make recommendations on the measures to be taken to prevent the recurrence of such power failures."
