  "original_body_lines": [
    "Cabinet Spokesman and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday criticised the decision by postal workers to launch trade union action, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d particularly as the Government continues its efforts to address longstanding issues within the sector.",
    "Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he responded to queries regarding the planned withdrawal from all overtime duties by postal workers countrywide. Trade Unions said the decision to strike was driven by the absence of systemic recruitment since 2016, an issue that has been raised repeatedly with little tangible progress.",
    "However, the Minister countered that the Government has already engaged in several rounds of discussions with trade union representatives and reiterated that continuous strikes would only undermine the service and delay reforms.",
    "\u201cThe Department of Posts is currently running at a loss. What the country needs is not the same department we had 100 years ago. We need a modernised, competitive postal service. Strikes like these only push us further back and make it harder to restore public confidence,\u201d he stressed.",
    "Acknowledging that there are some valid demands, he said addressing them requires time, institutional restructuring and responsible dialogue.",
    "\u201cThese types of actions are harmful, especially without exhausting avenues for proper dialogue. You cannot expect overnight solutions to problems that have accumulated over years. Frequent strikes will only derail efforts to meet financial targets by year end,\u201d he pointed out."
