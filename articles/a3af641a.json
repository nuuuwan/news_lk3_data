  "original_body_lines": [
    "Several concerned members of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) - Attorneys-at-Law including President's Counsels have urged the newly appointed five-member expertise Committee of Inquiry to look into the very serious and perturbing allegations of misconduct against few members of the Bar Association office bearers into the JICA funded project/ activities.",
    "This five member expertise Committee of Inquiry was appointed by the Bar Council on May 18, 2024 and consist of Dr. K. Kanag-Isvaran PC, Dr. Faisz Musthapha PC, Rienzie Arsekuleratne PC, Ikram Mohamed PC and Geoff Alagaratnam PC.",
    "The Daily Mirror in its May 22nd edition exposed this alleged misconduct under the caption \u2018Did BASL misappropriate monies sent by JICA for anti-corruption programme\u2019.",
    "According to BASL Financial Report as at April 30, 2024, which this newspaper is in possession, President and Deputy President of the BASL have been paid Rs 6 and 3 million respectively out of the project money.",
    "Issuing a letter on May 28 to the five member committee copying to the Executive and Management Committees, the BASL members while welcoming the appointment of this committee, states that the Bar Council has taken an excellent step to ensure full accountability and protect the moral authority of the Bar Association, as an honest, responsible professional body that genuinely upholds propriety, transparency and integrity in all its dealings where any serious lapses are credibly alleged to have occurred.",
    "The letter further states, \u2018The matters you are entrusted with inquiring into entail very serious allegations of misconduct against certain BASL office-bearers. We note that no stone is left unturned to impose full responsibility, liability and accountability and that the recommendations made are objective and duly reflect what is warranted and merited in terms of facts exposed and findings made irrespective of persons and personalities involved.",
    "\u2018Therefore, due consideration and findings as to whether there is any apparent breach of applicable professional ethics in terms of the Supreme Court Rules 1988 (on conduct and etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law), by the persons concerned remains crucial for the Bar Council and the membership to be able to determine what steps are warranted to hold those concerned accountable. We urge, the findings are covered in your report for due consideration of the Bar Council and its membership. We also demand that all those allegedly liable for any misconduct in relation to the project/ activities involving JICA and the BASL should not be inclined to voluntarily step down from functioning any office of the association forthwith pending the inquiry and the final determination. Failure to do so, would inflict great harm on the association and its ability to claim true commitment to good governance norms. We thank you for undertaking the burden of unpleasant duty of conducting a full, proper and fair inquiry without fear or favour\u2019."
