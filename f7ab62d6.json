    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Grama Nildhari unions have expressed their support for a proposed Janasabha or people\u2019s council system, a statement said.",
    "The Jathika Janasabha Secretariat or the National People\u2019s Council Secretariat said in a statement on Tuesday August 08 that representatives of the All Ceylon Liberate Grama Niladari Association, Sri Lanka United Grama Niladari Association and Sri Lanka Grama Niladari Association shared their views on the system at a discussion held at the secretariat.",
    "\u201cThe associations praised the development process that the Janasabha system could bring to rural areas. However, they also indicated their belief that the Janasabha Secretary selection process should be refined to ensure the proper candidates are chosen,\u201d the statement said.",
    "The meeting was attended by Chairman of the National Movement for a Just Society and former speaker Karu Jayasuriya and others.",
    "In October 2022, Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers approved a proposal by President Ranil Wickemesinghe to adopt a people\u2019s council system as \u201cfundamental\u201d government policy and also establish a National People\u2019s Council Secretariat.",
    "The secretariat was expected to serve as the national level independent central institution for establishing the proposed People\u2019s Councils (Jana Sabha) system, aimed at strengthening participatory democracy in Sri Lanka.",
    "Due to the gap between the center of governance and the people of the periphery, Sri Lanka\u2019s representative democratic structures do not pay due attention to public opinion in the policy and decision-making process, a government information department statement said in October.",
    "Opinions and objections against representative democracy are emerging in society, the statement claimed, highlighting the need for a \u201cstrong mechanism where public officials and the public can discuss rural issues together\u201d and \u201cdetermine development priorities\u201d.",
    "It will be possible to effectively and efficiently prevent public oppression that may occur due to bureaucracy and arbitrary politicisation through an organised mechanism that actively find public opinions for public policy formulation and implement those policies with community participation, the statement said.",
    "The cabinet decision, according to the statement, was based on a concept paper by the National Movement for a Just Society on a People\u2019s Council system with an independent institutional structure where public participation can be ensured for the formulation of public policies and the successful implementation of those policies.",
    "The concept paper also proposed the establishment of the \u2018National People\u2019s Council\u2019 and \u2018Village People\u2019s Councils\u2019 to cover every Grama Niladhari division in the Island. (Colombo/Aug08/2023)"
