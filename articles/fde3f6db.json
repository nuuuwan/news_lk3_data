    "For more than ten years this\u00a0Seeya\u00a0has been complaining about the potentially deadly concrete wall at the Galle Road end of Colombo International Airport\u00a0Ratmalana (CIAR).",
    "There have been several fatal crashes of aircraft into similar walls or man-made obstructions at various locations around the world: American Airlines, at Little Rock, Arkansas, USA on June 1, 1999 (11 fatalities); Aria Air (of Iran), at Mashhad, Iran on July 24, 2009 (16 fatalities); Air India Express at Kozhikode-Calicut, India, August 7, 2020 (16 fatalities).",
    "Most recently, on December 29, 2024 a Boeing 737-800 of Jeju Air landing at Muan International Airport, South Korea crashed into a berm, or concrete barrier, at the end of the runway, resulting in the loss of 179 of the 181 \u2018souls on board\u2019.",
    "In Sri Lanka, the Aircraft Owners\u2019 and Operators\u2019 Association (AOAOA) has frequently raised concerns about the likelihood of a serious incident or accident at Ratmalana resulting from an aircraft running into the wall. The association\u2019s representations on this serious safety issue were made directly to the nation\u2019s joint aviation authorities: Civil Aviation Authority Sri Lanka (CAASL); Airport and Aviation Sri Lanka (AASL); and Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). Yet none of those bodies has jointly or severally paid any attention to addressing the AOAOA\u2019s warnings.",
    "It would appear that the regulatory authorities are either ignorant of, or choose to ignore, the fact that the wall at CIAR is in violation of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards and recommended procedures which specify that, in instances where such a wall or berm is necessary, a frangible fence (i.e. designed to break easily on impact) should be erected instead of a solid, reinforced-concrete barrier.",
    "Now, despite the lesson from the Jeju Air/Muan tragedy, will our joint authorities continue to \u2018sit on their hands\u2019 while ignoring the AOAOA\u2019s pleas based on safety considerations and rational thinking?",
    "Interestingly, two of those three authorities are now headed by the same individuals who were responsible for constructing the wall, which is supposedly earning money for the \u2018welfare\u2019 of SLAF personnel by serving as a billboard or hoarding for commercial advertisements.",
    "If money is their concern \u2013 either advertising revenue, or the cost of dismantling the RIA wall \u2013 the authorities would do well to heed the advice of a veteran aviator and safety expert who once said: \u201cIf you think that safety is expensive, try an accident.\u201d",
