ECONOMYNEXT – A Sri Lanka rubber traders group has said the government’s decision to abolish the Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) scheme from October 1 would cause ‘severe and far-reaching consequences’, and urged it to differ or phase it out.

“Removing SVAT without a tested and operational refund mechanism will trigger widespread financial distress across Sri Lanka’s natural rubber industry, threatening smallholder livelihoods, SME viability, export competitiveness, and foreign exchange inflows vital to the nation’s recovery,” the Colombo Rubber Traders’ Association (CRTA) said in a statement.

Sri Lanka’s natural rubber sector supports tens of thousands of smallholder farmers, CRTA pointed out.

“The removal of SVAT will force manufacturers to pay billions in VAT upfront, causing delays in purchasing raw rubber and exerting downward pressure on farm gate prices.”

### United Nations arms embargo, other sanctions reimposed on Iran

The United Nations reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran on Saturday following a process triggered by key European powers that Tehran has warned will be met with a harsh response.

Britain, France and Germany triggered the return of sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council over accusations the country has violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.

The end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites.

U.N. sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday (0000 GMT). Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. this week.

### The Importance Of Education In Emergencies For Eliminating The Dependency Mindset

*2025-09-27 22:03:58* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-importance-of-education-in-emergencies-for-eliminating-the-dependency-mindset/) · `en`

Emergencies—whether natural disasters, armed conflicts, pandemics, or economic crises—disrupt the normal functioning of societies. In such contexts, the education system often collapses, leaving children and communities vulnerable to a “dependency mindset.” This mindset is characterized by reliance on external aid rather than building self-reliance and sustainable solutions.

Education plays a critical role in preventing and eliminating this dependency. By continuing learning even during crises, education nurtures resilience, independence, and problem-solving capabilities, enabling individuals and communities to rebuild their futures

The dependency mindset refers to a psychological and social state where individuals or communities rely excessively on external aid rather than developing internal capacities to solve their own problems.

At least 100 people are feared dead following the collapse of a gold mining pit in Nigeria’s Zamfara State, survivors and residents said on Friday.

The pit at the Kadauri mining site in the Maru local government area caved in on Thursday while scores of artisanal miners were working underground, witnesses told Reuters. Rescue operations continued into Friday.

Sanusi Auwal, a local resident involved in rescue efforts, said at least 13 bodies had been retrieved from the rubble, including that of his cousin. “Over 100 miners were involved during the collapse,” Auwal told Reuters by phone.

“We are lucky to be rescued alive. Out of more than 100 people, only 15 of us were rescued,” said Isa Sani, who is currently receiving treatment for injuries.

Muhammadu Isa of the Zamfara State miners association confirmed the incident, adding that some rescuers also suffocated while trying to dig out victims.

### Cultivating Circular Futures: Youth as Agents of Change

*2025-09-27 17:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/cultivating-circular-futures-youth-as-agents-of-change/) · `en`

On September 29, the world marks the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste,

highlighting one of humanity’s pressing paradoxes. As the global population nears 8.5 billion by 2030, we still waste 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually – enough to feed three billion people. Sri Lanka is no exception. This crisis calls for urgent action, and increasingly, young people are emerging as catalysts for change.

The traditional “take-make-use-discard” model has proved unsustainable. A shift toward circular approaches – refuse, regenerate, reuse, and redesign – is gaining global momentum. At the heart of this transformation lies a simple truth: when young people embrace circular principles, they can reshape communities and inspire wider system change.

### The Kingswood Reader: A refined and sophisticated opus:

*2025-09-27 17:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-kingswood-reader-a-refined-and-sophisticated-opus/) · `en`

When I received the invitation to speak at this most august occasion, I must confess, I had to check Vihanga Perera’s invitation twice. You see, I’m not from Kingswood. I’m a Josephian—and in schoolboy terms, that makes me something like the distant cousin you see only at weddings, funerals, and maybe, at cricket or rugger matches.

But let me tell you sincerely why I stand here. Because beyond the colours of our alma maters, beyond the chants of “Go Kingswood!” or “Forward Joes!”, there is something more lasting, more sacred, more binding. It is the soul of our schools. It is memory. It is story. It is the written word that we pass down like a torch, from one generation to the next.

### The Hypocrisy Of The Scalpel: Is Sri Lanka’s Medical Watchdog Controlled By A Union?

*2025-09-27 17:42:28* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-hypocrisy-of-the-scalpel-is-sri-lankas-medical-watchdog-controlled-by-a-union/) · `en`

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Sri Lanka’s powerful doctors’ trade union, is currently making headlines for urging the Minister of Health to appoint a President to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) who possesses “the highest stature, qualifications, and credentials,” is free from any conflicts of interest, and has no “commitments which may interfere” with their duties.

It’s an admirable demand—but the entire medical profession and the public are left asking: Is this the ultimate act of hypocrisy?

The GMOA’s call for unimpeachable integrity at the top is directly contradicted by serious allegations regarding its own actions within the SLMC, the very body mandated to regulate and discipline doctors for the public good.
