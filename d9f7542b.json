    "The committee of experts appointed to investigate the recent incidents of drug allergies and their aftereffects has handed over its report to the Ministry of Health today (Aug. 08).",
    "The committee, chaired by the Director of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Dedunu Dias, consisted of six members including Prof. Chandima Jeewandara, Head of the Allergy Immunology and Cell Biology Unit of Sri Jayewardenepura University.",
    "Taking to Twitter, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said the full report would not be disclosed due to doctor-patient confidentiality.",
    "Accordingly, only the conclusion and recommendations have been made public.",
    "The report suggests that out of the six cases analyzed in detail, five have met the criteria for anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction that happens very quickly.",
    "Among the five patients who had anaphylaxis, the causality assessment using WHO-UMC causality assessment criteria categorized four adverse drug reactions as probable due to the suspected drug.",
    "Minister Keheliya said he is awaiting the results of the quality test of the drug in question after a thorough, independent examination by the National Drug Quality Control Laboratory (NDQL).",
    "He said this is why he had discussed with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to set up a \u2018Benchmark 4\u2019 laboratory funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) to qualitatively expedite such queries.",
    "Deep concerns were raised in the country about the alleged \u2018substandard drug imports\u2019 after an allergic reaction caused by an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone resulted in the death of a 21-year-old girl who was receiving treatment at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital in July for indigestion issues.",
    "She had shown signs of an allergic reaction after being administered the second vial of Ceftriaxone which contained a dose of 1mg. It was reported that the young woman had not shown any signs of an allergic reaction after the first dose was administered.",
    "Days later, two other patients who were under medical care at the Kandy National Hospital too had developed allergic reactions to the antibiotic, after which the batch of the antibiotic used in the Kandy National Hospital and Peradeniya Teaching Hospital was withheld.",
    "On July 17, Health Minister Rambukwella appointed the seven-member committee chaired by Dr. Dedunu Dias."
