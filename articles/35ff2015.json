  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Sri Lankan Foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was killed on 12 August 2005  by a sniper of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) concealed in the house of an unsuspecting neighbour. Kadirgamar  had just completed his customary 1000 metre swim at the pool in his residence, when the assassin struck. Two decades  have passed since that fateful day but the memory of Kadirgamar lingers still in the hearts and minds of the nation. This column focuses on the man regarded by many as Sri Lanka\u2019s finest foreign minister even as Lakshman Kadirgamar.s 20th death anniversary draws near.",
    "I have written extensively about Lakshman Kadirgamar over the years, so much so that his only daughter Ajita has stated in her book about her father that D.B.S. Jeyaraj has written about LK possibly more than any other journalist. Ajita Kadirgamar\u2019s eminently readable book about Lakshman Kadirgamar is titled \u201cThe Cake That Was Baked At Home.\u201d  A new edition of the book has been released this year to denote Kadirgamar\u2019s 20 th death anniversary.",
    "According to Ajita, the book has 78 references to lines and passages from my articles. She even says on one page that she \u2018would almost term me as \u2018LK\u2019s unofficial biographer\u2019. It is against this backdrop therefore that I write on  the multi-faceted personality ,Lakshman Kadirgamar drawing on some of my earlier writings also.",
    "Lakshman Kadirgamar was born on 12 April 1932 to Tamil Protestant Christian parents of Jaffna origin. But in later life he refused to conform according to those labels. He never denied that he was a Tamil, but claimed to have transcended such labels. At a time when the Tigers (LTTE) and their acolytes were trying to equate being Tamil with being a pro-Tiger, Kadirgamar stood out \u2018far from the madding crowd\u2019. For that he was ridiculed as a \u2018token\u2019 Tamil , dubbed a traitor and ultimately assassinated.",
    "When the BBC \u2018Hard Talk\u2019 interviewed Kadirgamar some weeks before his death, he was asked about being called \u2018traitor\u2019 Kadirgamar responded to it magnificently. He said that all of us are given labels at the time of birth and that he too was given one. If being\u201dTamil meant supporting the LTTE in acts like child conscription, killing opponents, denying democracy and pluralism etc., he was not prepared to do so. If that resulted in him being called traitor then he \u2018would be absolutely delighted in being called one,\u2019 Kadirgamar said.",
    "Lakshman Kadirgamar was born in Manipay,Jaffna  on April 12, 1932 as the youngest of six children.  His father was  Samuel Jebaratnam Christian (SJC) Kadirgamar snr,  a lawyer. SJC Kadirgamar married Edith Rosemand Parimalam Mather the daughter of Edward Mather of Manipay. They had five boys and a girl.",
    "The eldest SJC jnr or Sam Kadirgamar was the well known Queens Counsel. Selvanathan or Bhai Kadirgamar a major in the army later emigrated to the USA. Rajan was the former Sri Lankan Navy commander. Thirumalan or Mana Kadirgamar was a planter who died early meeting with a motor accident in Dickoya. Lakshman\u2019s elder sister Eeswari was married to Dr.A.M.D. Richards.",
    "While all his brothers were educated at Royal only Lakshman went to Trinity presumably due to world war 2,  where he studied from 1942 to 1950. He won many awards while at Trinity including the Dr. Andreas Nell Memorial Prize for Ceylon History- Napier Clavering Prize for English and the Ryde Gold Medal for the best all round student in 1950.",
    "In sports he got cricket colours, was Cricket Captain -1950. Rugby Colours-1949. Athletics Colours-1949 and Trinity Lion 1950. He came first at Public Schools, and broke the record in the 110m hurdles (15.7 seconds) in 1949. He won the Duncan White Challenge Cup-1949 De Soysa Challenge Cup-1949. was Senior Prefect in 1949.",
    "He entered the Peradeniya University and read for an LLB degree there. While an undergraduate, he won the All Ceylon 110m hurdles title in 1951 and 1952, All India inter University 110m hurdles title and set records at Ahamedabad in 1951 and Allahabad in 1952. He was also Member of the cricket teams of the University of Ceylon and later Balliol College, University of Oxford becoming an Oxford Blue in Cricket.",
    "After getting his Bachelor\u2019s degree in law Kadirgamar passed the Advocates final first in order of merit. He then served as secretary to Justice ENA Gratiaen. He later went to England, becoming a Barrister of the Inner Temple and entering Balliol College Oxford.",
    "He made history in Oxford getting elected as President of the Oxford Union. Four Sri Lankans have been Presidents. They are Kadirgamar (Trinity) Athulathmudali (Royal) Noordeen (STC) and Jeyasundharie Wilson (Methodist), the only woman President from Sri Lanka.",
    "In 1958 during the communal violence Lakshman Kadirgamar when interviewed by the media in the UK said that SWRD Bandaranaike was only a \u201cpolitician\u201d and not a \u201cstatesman\u201d because of the violence. The next year, Lakshman was instrumental in getting a portrait of SWRD hung up at Oxford. The tradition is that any Oxford Union President who becomes head of state gets a bust. Since SWRD was only treasurer of the union he got a portrait. SWRD however was assassinated a few weeks before he was to visit Oxford for the ceremony. In his absence it was left to Lakshman to do the honours.",
    "Many years later Lakshman Kadirgamar\u2019s portrait was unveiled at the Oxford Union on March 18, 2005 by Rt. Hon Lord Chris Patten of Barnes CH, Chancellor of the University of Oxford. It was then that Lakshman  remarked famously \u201cthe cake was baked at home\u201d.",
    "In the history of the Oxford Union, he was the fifteenth office bearer whose bust or portrait is displayed in the Union building. Kadirgamar was also made Hon. Master of the Inner Temple-1995 -the second Asian to be made so after former Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.",
    "While at Balliol Kadirgamar married an artist Angela Malik of French \u2013 Pakistani descent. They had two children. The daughter is Ajita Perera the  well-known media personality.Kadirgamar\u2019s son, an architect, is  named Sriraghavan Jebaratnam Christian but is generally known as Ragee.",
    "In later years Kadirgamar divorced his first wife and married again in 1996.  He married Suganthi Wijeysuriya, a senior lawyer.",
    "After returning to Sri Lanka in the sixties from Oxford. Lakshman made several visits to Jaffna during this time. One objective was to rediscover his roots. Another was to scout around for a prospective electorate.",
    "He was also a keen student of history and very much interested in that of the Jaffna kingdom. Though his pro- Tiger critics used to chide him as an ignoramus in the history and traditions of Jaffna people those  who have heard him speak on such  subjects  were amazed at his knowledge and insight.",
    "During one of his Jaffna trips in the sixties, Kadirgamar addressed the Jaffna YMCA on an interesting theme. His lecture was titled \u201cFrom Plato to Sirimavo\u201d. When excerpts of that lecture were carried in newspapers Mrs. Bandaranaike was reportedly annoyed. Years later she herself telephoned Lakshman inviting him to join her daughter President Chandrika Kumaratunga\u2019s cabinet of which the grand old lady was Prime Minister.",
    "As stated earlier Kadirgamar  began visiting Jaffna during the early sixties  prospecting for a constituency.The prospective candidate\u2019s enthusiasm however was short-lived for two reasons.",
    "Firstly his discovery of the state of politics in the North. Tamil nationalism had risen to the fore and demanded pandering to that concept by prospective candidates. This narrow nationalism was not to his liking. Second ly  he was unable to even speak Tamil to the extent of making political speeches.",
    "Also despite his ancestry there were no firm roots in Jaffna. It was doubtful that Lakshman could face the hustle and bustle of Jaffna politics let alone win. His Jaffna based cousins gave him their candid views on his political prospects in Jaffna. Lakshman realised that his political chances in the peninsula were slimmer than the Isthmus of Aanai Iravu (Elephant Pass).",
    "He was further discouraged in his political ambition by his elder brothers in Colombo, Sam JC Kadirgamar the lawyer and Rajanathan (Rajan) Kadirgamar the Naval Commander. Both advised him to drop his political ambition and concentrate on his law.",
    "Their father SJC (snr) had established a lucrative practice in Colombo and was also the founder president of the Ceylon Legal Society. Lakshman heeded the advice of his brothers and cousins and began focusing on the law. There are some of Lakshman\u2019s relatives who believe that he would have never entered politics had his two elder brothers been alive. Both Rajan and Sam had passed away before Lakshman entered politics in 1994.",
    "Lakshman Kadirgamar then settled down firmly in Colombo and establishing  a solid practice. He was specialised in commercial, industrial, labour and administrative law. Then came the JVP insurgency of 1971. This had a profound impact on Lakshman. Though not affected directly, the JVP revolt made Lakshman feel that he should go abroad.",
    "He felt that life in Lanka was going to turn worse with the advent of the JVP. How very prophetic! But ironically enough the very same Lakshman who left Sri Lanka due to the JVP found himself on the best of terms with the \u201crathu sahodarayas\u201d 33 years later. The JVP found in Lakshman a sincere friend and guide while Lakshman recognized a \u201clike\u2013mindedness\u201d on some issues. The recent turn of events resulting in the JVP led NPP  ruling Sri Lanka may have delighted him if he were alive today.",
    "Lakshman relocated to Britain . He pursued a legal career from 1971 to 74 during which he showed keen interest in human rights. In 1973 he was the special representative of Amnesty International investigating the Buddhist \u2013 Catholic violence in Vietnam . In 1976 he became consultant to the International Labour Organization (ILO)in Geneva . In 1978 he joined the World Intellectual property organization (WIPO) and served as its director till 1988.He was the virtual adviser on intellectual property to developing nations of Asia \u2013 pacific.",
    "He also travelled widely. In the early eighties he was in an airplane that crashed in  Athens,Greece. Kadirgamar survived miraculously by jumping through the emergency exit. He broke several bones and was bed\u2013ridden for three months.",
    "Lakshman Kadirgamar returned to Colombo  in 1988 and reestablished his legal practice. He concentrated as earlier on industrial,labour and commercial law and of course intellectual property law. Another less known fact was that Kadirgamar was a discreet consultant avoiding limelight in a number of cases affecting Tamil detainees. He also proffered legal advice to some Tamils affected in the violence in procuring compensation.",
    "The \u201csecond coming\u201d of Chandrika Kumaratunga to Sri Lanka in the early nineties of the last century heralded a new dawn for ethno-politics in the country. There were high hopes that a negotiated settlement to the ethnic crisis was in sight. It was a period of idealistic fervour. It was in such a climate that Kadirgamar decided to enter politics in support of Kumaratunga. Lakshman deciding to join the SLFP in 1994 was a significant development ,as his family members  had been staunch UNP loyalists.",
    "Initially the person who persuaded Kadirgamar to join politics was  Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam of the TULF. He was ably supported by the lawyer Manouri Muttetuwegama \u2013 wife of Sarath Muttetuwegama(CP) and daughter of Colvin R de Silva (LSSP) \u2013 in this mission.",
    "Lakshman was placed on the SLFP national list in 1994. The only Tamil candidate of the SLFP with a chance of winning the hustings was lawyer Ketheeswaran in the Wanni. Kethees was the former TULF Urban council chairman in Vavuniya. But he did not win. So Kumaratunga had to appoint one Tamil as national list MP. This naturally was Lakshman.",
    "The new government had a majority of one through Up Country Peoples Front Tamil MP Chandrasekharan\u2019s support. He and Kadirgamar were the two Tamil representatives in the Kumaratunga Govt initially. Kumaratunga offered them both deputy\u2013 minister posts as she wanted to restrict her cabinet to twenty. Chandrasekharan accepted but not Kadir.",
    "Lakshman who rarely projected himself as a Tamil did so then. He pointed out that his community would consider it an insult if he was only to be given a deputy \u2013 ministership. Chandrika agreed. It was a choice of Justice or Foreign Affairs. Lakshman wanted the latter. He felt he  was immensely equipped for it.",
    "Kadirgamar proved subsequently that he was the best man for the job. In the post \u2013 independence years Defence and External affairs portfolios were the preserve of the Prime Minister. It was under JRJ in 1977 that a departure was made and ACS Hameed became foreign minister.",
    "It is broadly acknowledged that Kadirgamar was the best foreign minister the Country ever had. To many people, Kadirgamar was the best foreign minister because he spearheaded an anti\u2013Tiger drive. But the man\u2019s greatness was in cleaning up the Augean stables prevailing in the ministry due mainly to the cronyism of his predecessors.",
    "It was another Tamil, Sir Kandiah Vaithiyanathan as permanent secretary who set up a modern foreign service after Independence. It was Lakshman Kadirgamar who restructured and professionalised the service. Those who worked with him from Permanent secretary to office aide would vouch for this.",
    "Another of his achievements as foreign minister was restoring good relations with India eroded greatly under Jayewardene and Premadasa. Of course Indo \u2013 Lanka relations were always good under the Bandaranaike dynasty but the role of Kadirgamar cannot be discounted lightly in this restoration.",
    "It must be pointed out that Kadirgamar\u2019s affinity towards India and recognition of its pivotal importance in the region was based on enlightened self \u2013 interest with emotional underpinnings. Apart from the political aspects there was the spiritual aspect bordering on the personal.",
    "Lakshman\u2019s father was an  ardent admirer of Mahatma Gandhi.He was the chairman of a reception committee and presided over a meeting attended by the Mahatma in 1927 when Lakshman was yet unborn.",
    "Lakshman\u2019s mother, Parimalam requested Gandhi for his autograph. The Mahatma looking mischievously at the bright silk saree worn by her refused and told her that he would do so only if she wore \u201cghaddar\u201d (homespun cloth). She did not get her autograph then.",
    "Apart from this link with the Mahatma,  one of Lakshman\u2019s close relatives had been a disciple  of the Mahatma at Sabarmathy Ashram and another a student of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s  at Shanti Nikhetan. In that sense Lakshman too continued this historic link with India.",
    "In Lakshman\u2019s intellectual and spiritual journey Indian philosophical thought became heavily influential. Lakshman had evolved into an inter\u2013faith person. He was greatly enamoured of India\u2019s greatest son Gauthama Buddha and this was no pretension caused by contemporary political compulsions.",
    "Many years ago on October 9, 1992 , Lakshman Kadirgamar delivered the Rev. Celestine Fernando Memorial Address. The theme of that address was \u201c The Social Relevance of the Bible for, our times in a non-Christian society.\u201d He observed then \u201cDifferent creeds are the historical formulations of the formless truth. While the treasure is one and inviolable, the earthen vessel that contains it takes the shape and colour of its time and environment.\u201d",
    "The Celestine Fernando lecture caused some controversy in Christian circles because of the glowing references to Lord Buddha. Lakshman observed then: \u201cAmong the inspiring treasures of the human spirit is the memory of Gautama, the Buddha. His hold over the imagination of millions of our fellow beings is immense; his inspiration to braver and nobler living for centuries is incalculable; his contribution to the refining of the spirit of man and the humanising of human relations is immeasurable. And yet, attempts were made by men fighting under other flags, earnest lovers of their kind no doubt, to destroy the memory of that great soul, to terminate his influence. We can only attribute those efforts to prejudice, to ignorance.\u201d",
    "According to someone present at that lecture Kadirgamar\u2019s main thesis was that Christianity shared many common values and teachings with Buddhism and that Jesus had been influenced by the teachings of the Buddha. These views correspond to the thesis in the famous book by the German theologian, Holger Kersten titled Jesus lived In India \u2013 His Unknown Life Before And After The Crucifixion.",
    "So it is possible that Kadirgamar was increasingly attracted to the teachings of Buddha. But this seems more a milepost on an intellectual journey. He was very much a private person in his religious faith.",
    "On the day that Lakshman was sworn in as minister in 1994 in the early hours of the morning, a man was seen praying alone in the Buller\u2019s Road, Anglican Cathedral. The then Bishop, Kenneth Fernando was walking in when he noticed this. That man was Lakshman Kadirgamar.",
    "While his fundamental Christian faith remained he had evolved into one accepting the universality of religion though Christian dogmatists would dispute this",
    "Let me conclude this article with a few excerpts from an interview given by Lakshman Kadirgamar many,many  years ago. The \u201cLanka Academic\u201d website had a question and answer session with Kadirgamar .Some of his observations then revealed his thinking on some crucial issues.  Some of the viewpoints may be outdated in a post-war, post-LTTE context. However there are other views that are very relevant in the current context where \u2013  Kadirgamar\u2019s one time admirers \u2013 the crimson comrades wield power and are advocating a new Constitution.",
    "\u201cThe PA is for a federal-type structure which could give minorities, and particularly the Tamils, ample autonomy in their regional affairs without allowing the disintegration or break up of the Sri Lankan State. Therefore, two principles are important \u2013",
    "(2) to ensure safeguards against any type of disintegration, break away or secession.",
    "We also believe that given current international developments and the challenges that our country is facing we need to have a rather strong system at the centre as well.\u201d",
    "\u201c Therefore, we propose considerable power sharing at the centre in addition to devolution of power to the regions or the periphery. There are several minorities in the country and their geographical spread is such that we need to ensure a full measure of human rights and safeguards and their participation at all levels of government from periphery to the centre. \u201c",
    "\u201cThere is another factor that we have to take into account. There is a system of federalism in India which is not as broad as in many Western countries. What was primarily in the minds of the Indian Constitution makers when they devised a federal form of government for India was to preserve the unity and integrity of that country without allowing for its disintegration.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis principle applies to South Asia in general considering the existence of several secessionist movements in our midst. We also have to take into account our own evolution towards a federal type of system since the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987. We already have in place some extensive measures of devolution of power, of course, with major structural impediments. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. But the whole matter needs further and fuller discussion on a national scale in the light of evolving events on the ground in the North and East which throw doubt on whether the LTTE truly wishes to have a federal form of government, notwithstanding public statements to that effect\u201d",
    "\u201d There was a time when, for instance, the use of Tamil for official purposes was not recognised and there was discrimination against the Tamil-speaking community in respect of education and employment. The Tamils had grievances. That cannot be denied. The situation is much better now.But since independence the ethnic policy of successive governments has been characterised by a lack of foresight, mismanagement and broken promises \u2013 the Bandaranike/Chelvanayakam pact and the Dudley Senanayake/Chelvanayakan pact are examples\u201d.",
    "\u201d As for your question whether the Sri Lankan Tamils would have been better off if the LTTE did not drag the country into a bloody civil war, my personal view is that socio-economic and political questions can never be resolved by war. But one must try to understand why a generation of young Tamils who had witnessed unsuccessful satyagraha campaigns and other peaceful attempts to secure redress for their grievances came to the conclusion that there was no alternative but to resort to arms. \u201c",
    "\u201cHowever, as the armed conflict has progressed it has become increasingly clear that war cannot resolve the problems that led to war in the first place. Many Tamils, even those of a moderate persuasion, hold the view that if the LTTE had not taken up arms the question of a negotiated settlement of the ethnic problem would never have been considered by any government in the South. The same group of moderate Tamils would, I am sure, now say \u201cenough of war\u201d; the armed conflict must end; a solution must be found through negotiations.\u201d",
    "\u201c As for the homeland question I do not think the vast majority of Tamils, whether they presently live in Sri Lanka or abroad, would prefer to live under Mr. Prabhakarn\u2019s rule, rather than in a free, democratic, united Sri Lanka where the rights of minorities are adequately safeguarded\u201d.",
    "Let me conclude  on a personal note. My late father though older than Lakshman was a contemporary of his at Law College in 1954. I was born in 1954 and apparently Lakshman K was at the hospital to see the new babe. He also came for my baptism.",
    "My father lost touch with Lakshman in the sixties but always spoke highly of his brilliance. He also said that Lakshman though inarticulate in Tamil was deeply concerned about Sinhala being made the sole official language, the 1956 and \u201958 violence and the suppression of the Satyagraha campaign in 1961. My father never accepted the Tiger accusation that Kadirgamar was oblivious to the Tamil plight.",
    "I made contact in 1994 with Lakshman Kadirgamar in my professional capacity as a journalist due to the efforts of the late Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam. I was then editing my own Tamil weekly in Toronto. Kadirgamar had become a Cabinet Minister and was taking a keen interest in helping resolve the national problem.",
    "Neelan asked me to speak to Kadirgamar as the new Minister was very keen on gaining an insight into the Tamil national question. I think we spoke about four or five times on the telephone. One call in particular was extremely long extending for about 90 minutes.",
    "I found him very much interested and concerned about the Tamil issue. He was a keen listener and extremely polite even when disagreeing with something. I was then an ardent Tamil nationalist  who believed  in the bona fides of the LTTE. I was one of those Tamils who thought naively then that the LTTE was fighting for the welfare of the Tamil people and not in the interests of its leadership. Like many Tamils of a similar mindset I thought that the LTTE was prepared for a just, equitable and honourable settlement in a united but not necessarily unitary Sri Lanka.",
    "Kadirgamar was extremely receptive and agreed that federalism would be the ideal solution. But he had reservations on two counts. One was that he felt any realistic solution had to be acceptable to the majority of the Sinhala people as otherwise it would not be implementable.",
    "Therefore he opined that the concept federalism should be avoided and the term maximum devolution substituted instead. Secondly he said that any settlement had to be on lines acceptable to India. Therefore powers to be devolved to the periphery should not go too much beyond the Centre-State relationship parameters of India he felt.",
    "Apart from this he too subscribed initially to the school of thought that a settlement was necessary with only the LTTE from the Tamil side. Though the LTTE would have us believe otherwise, the Kadirgamar of 1994 firmly believed in political reconciliation with the LTTE.",
    "Kadirgamar spoke with a lot of Tamils to assess the situation. One person with whom he discussed the issue frankly and deeply was the late CSI Bishop of Jaffna Rt. Rev. D.J. Ambalavanar. I suppose that most Tamils like myself would have told him that the LTTE was keen on a settlement but had to tread the path of transition warily and slowly.",
    "He accepted and firmly pushed that line within the folds of Government in 1994 and early 1995.He was thoroughly shattered in 1995 when the LTTE broke faith and resumed hostilities on 18 April. My last conversation with him was a few days after this. Kadirgamar was agitated despite his customary aplomb. He was critical of me and all those who spoke positively of the LTTE. I remonstrated and when there were signs of a prolonged argument he wound up the conversation abruptly. We never spoke  directly to each other thereafter.",
