Though our economy be bruised, the external economic context and our innate geographic blessings, when bound with sound fiscal policies, shall certainly prevent a repeat of the ills that visited the Lankan economy in 2022

This article attempts an analysis of the eerily similar roads travelled in both Sri Lanka and the Maldives towards a fiscal cliff. Even though, we here in the Maldives, have not slipped off the precipice, the landscape is familiar and the dangers real and tangible.

However, it is important to stress at the outset, that while the terrain is familiar, it is not inevitable that we here in the Maldives too, tumble down the fiscal cliff into тАШwhite watersтАЩ of internal turmoil, collapse of the political system and of an economic meltdown.

Prior to 2015, a massive voice was raised among the people on racism, religion and corruption. If the Ranil -Maithri government came to power in 2015, the country would have improved.

Religious leaders advised Gotabhaya Rajapakse to manage this country to become Hitler. But he was spontaneously stupid. In the end, the country opposed the worst crises.

It was in this context that the people of the country formed the power -led government. Remember that there is no way. The authority is like swing.
