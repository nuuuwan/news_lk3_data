    "In Sri Lanka there is a powerful narrative \u00a0\u2013 often repeated \u2013 that debt repayments will resume in 2028 or 2029, depending on whom people listen to.",
    "Around 2028, Sri Lanka is expected to get market access, which can reduce the repayments as the country has the possibility of rolling over maturing debt.",
    "Many of Sri Lanka\u2019s other bonds, including macro-linked bonds, are amortizing securities.",

    "Monetary stability allows domestically raised rupees \u2013 either from taxes or treasury bills \u2013 to be converted to dollars to repay debt. The government will then be left with rupee securities instead of dollar debt as there is no overall budget surplus.",
    "\u201cAs of the end of June 2025, total government external debt stood at USD 37,138 million, reflecting a nominal reduction of USD 104 million from USD 37,242 million recorded at the end of the first quarter of 2025,\u201d the Debt Management Office said.",

    "Based on the Keynesian mis-understanding of external payments in a country with a reserve collecting bank- of-issue, generally known as the \u2018transfer problem\u2019, Sri Lanka also enacted a active liability management law to borrow heavily abroad instead of settling maturing debt and interest with deflationary policy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Treasury does not buy its own dollars in the market, or collect taxes in dollars due to a legal tender monopoly given to macro-economists, and is therefore hostage to deflationary monetary policy to get dollars.",
    "Countries started to default wholesale in the 1980s after the IMF\u2019s Second Amendment left them without a credible anchor for money and many of them continue to default regardless of fiscal corrections made as the original monetary trouble is not fixed.",
    "Before the IMF, the inflating central bank tended to be closed and the country dollarized, or a central bank based on basic classical economics rules, instead of macro-economics was set up.",
    "The most prominent early example was the setting up of the Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder (BdL) which was under the full control of the hard money Ordoliberals in the political leadership through the Allied occupation authority in West Germany.",
    "It provided provided stability for the German economic miracle, until the Bundesbank proper was set up nearly a decade later on the same principles.",
    "The Reichsbank which created monetary instability through World War I, the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany was shutdown, freeing Germany from its operating framework.",
    "Latin America, which is most exposed to Saltwater post-Keynesian universities in the US, suffered most from monetary troubles after World War II.",
