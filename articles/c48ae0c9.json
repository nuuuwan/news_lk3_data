    "On the occasion of the presentation of my publication to Rienzie Wijetilleke",
    "He was fully aware the bank was operating in a competitive environment and believed in providing a superior customer service and took personal initiative to ensure the bank provides an excellent customer service and introduced various monitoring mechanisms towards compliance. Customer complaints were taken seriously by him and he established an exclusive unit to handle customer complaints which was under his direct purview",
    "There have been many articles and contributions by various personalities on the life and times of Rienzie Wijetilleke, particularly his immense contribution towards the financial sector. In this appreciation of mine, I venture and take the liberty to share and give an insight to Wijetilleke\u2019s human touch, having had the privilege of associating with him during my own assignment with HNB for more than three decades. He was a philanthropist with inimitable human qualities and initiated several CSR projects towards assisting the needy and many charitable organisations.",
    "I came to know Wijetilleke during the 70s on my entry to HNB as a junior member attached to one of HNB\u2019s branches in the metropolitan. It was during that time Wijetilleke was attached to the newly opened Ratnapura branch of the bank as the Manager having left Bank of Ceylon, the premier banking institution of the country to join HNB, which was in its infancy. It was during that time Wijetilleke was a frequent visitor to our branch, since HNB had only six branches at that time and the branch I was attached to was very much in the news.",
    "During those visits he never failed to speak to us young bankers even though his major interactions were with the branch management. I should however, confess during my entire career with HNB, I never had the opportunity to work under his direct purview which of course I consider as a lost opportunity since I feel such an opportunity would have expedited my own career prospects as he was a personality capable of identifying and recognising the resources. Nevertheless, after progressing in my own career, I had several interactions with him and he greatly appreciated my contributions on numerous occasions.",
    "Wijetilleke rose up faster in his career and in 1983 relinquished his position as the Manager of City Office which is considered as the \u201cblood of the bank\u201d in his own words to take up a position at the British Bank of the Middle East in Dubai. It was in 1987, the then Managing Director of HNB Dharmaraja who was personally instrumental in inviting Wijetilleke to succeed him as he was well aware of his capabilities to steer the bank as there were no potential successors within the bank which compelled him to extend an invitation to Wijetilleke which he readily accepted. The rest is history.",
    "It was in 1987, Wijetilleke was named as the successor to Dharmaraja, initially as the General Manager and within a few days he was elevated as the Managing Director of the bank. I vividly remember at the felicitation ceremony of the outgoing Managing Director, Dharmaraja, Wijetilleke, presented a memento with 33 gold crafted coins as a token of appreciation to his predecessor. In his address to the audience while thanking the outgoing MD for his contribution to the bank he stated that the 33 coins depicted on the memento is to indicate their appreciation for handing over a bank with 33 branches, considered as a profitable venture.",
    "Dharmaraja in his reply while thanking the audience for the appreciation stated he could give one advice to his successor and all those present, \u201cRemember you are handling depositors\u2019 money the moment you mishandle you will be out of business.\u201d These words of wisdom still linger in my mind and I always share this at many of my lectures and training programs. Wijetilleke true to his words not only successfully steered the bank to greater heights, he expanded the branch network to close upon 200 at the time of his retirement in 2005.",
    "Wijetilleke, always believed in having a human touch and introduced the concept of \u201cHatna Family\u201d under which he brought in each and every employee of the bank under one umbrella, irrespective of their grade. He eliminated the rigid approval process on staff housing loan facilities which was in existence as he felt each and every employee of the bank should have a permanent roof over their head. I am aware he introduced a stipulation which made it compulsory to obtain his concurrence for any rejection of the staff housing loan application. This stipulation naturally resulted in the expeditious approval of staff housing loans. This was greatly appreciated by the staff.",
    "He always believed in recognising the contributions of all employees past and present and during his tenure all pensioners of the bank were given an annual increment.",
    "Staff facilities were enhanced periodically as he was of the opinion the resources of the bank should be adequately compensated for their contribution. He practiced an open door policy which paved the way for the staff members of the bank to meet him if they had any grievances. Despite his tight schedule he ensured his presence at all funerals connected to the bank staff and never failed to accept an invitation if invited for a wedding or an important function. In addition he ensured his presence at all the major events of the bank, whether it is Wesak Bakthi gee or Christmas carols, he was there and it was a pleasure to witness his charismatic presence. Most of the staff members were known to him by their first name which naturally brought in a human touch. That was the style of his leadership which made him stand taller in the corporate world.",
    "During his tenure there was an internal news Magazine \u201cHatnamag\u201d which highlighted all the news and happenings of the bank and its resources which was issued free to each and every employee of the bank. The quality of this publication was very high. He was instrumental in ensuring this magazine which was a quarterly issue was made available to all the pensioners of the bank and we used to receive our copy direct from him with a note \u201cWith compliments from the Chairman\u201d.",
    "I remember, immediately on the opening of the \u201cHNB Towers\u201d he ensured to appreciate the contributions made by the pensioners of the bank. He was instrumental in organising a special felicitation ceremony for all the pensioners of the bank. All pensioners were invited to the HNB Towers and a multimedia presentation was made at the luxurious auditorium to enlighten the pensioners and give an insight covering every aspect of the HNB Towers. All pensioners were presented with a beautiful replica of the HNB Towers and the event was followed by dinner in appreciation and recognition of their own contribution towards the success of the bank. The pensioners were moved by this thoughtful gesture and were grateful to him as they felt a sense of belonging.",
    "It was during his tenure we formed an association to look after the welfare of the HNB-retired employees and he readily consented to be the patron of this association which gave greater recognition to the association. All the discussions the association had with him were positive. He was very particular the employees\u2019 children were taken care of and was keen in employing the children of the bank staff who were given priority. Many have benefitted and are gainfully employed in the bank.",
    "He was fully aware the bank was operating in a competitive environment and believed in providing a superior customer service and took personal initiative to ensure the bank provides an excellent customer service and introduced various monitoring mechanisms towards compliance. Customer complaints were taken seriously by him and he established an exclusive unit to handle customer complaints which was under his direct purview.",
    "I remember in one of his addresses within the bank he stated, \u201cWe have close upon 5,000 resources. However, some of them are unproductive. I will never send them home. They can come to work sit on a corner, they will get all their perks, annual increment, bonus, etc. I will tolerate incompetency, however, I will not tolerate dishonesty.\u201d These are his words and shows his human aspect.",
    "He was instrumental in successfully negotiating several mergers and acquisitions with other leading financial institutions which brought HNB to greater heights. His visionary leadership was the main pillar of success of HNB which has today emerged as a household name, well accepted and recognised as a reputed and highly respected financial institution with global recognition.",
    "The HNB Towers which is considered as the monument of the success story of HNB, was his brain child and he withstood and overcame many obstacles in undertaking this task. Today, HNB Towers is considered as one of the tallest and luxurious head office buildings of a bank in the country. It will be appropriate to name the auditorium at the HNB Towers as \u2018Rienzie Wijetilleke Auditorium\u2019 in appreciation of his contribution to HNB and for his vision towards building the HNB Towers.",
    "I was privileged to have his presence at the launch of my first publication and thereafter I met him in 2024 to present my latest publications. He was extremely pleased and appreciated my contribution in sharing my knowledge.",
    "The large number of members of the \u201cHatna Family\u201d past and present who were present at his final farewell, even though he was not in power bears testimony to the love and affection they have for him. There were many who shared their own stories and the interactions they had with him. At a time appreciation is a rare commodity it was refreshing to witness such a large crowd at his funeral to say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to a great visionary and charismatic leader.",
    "Needless to state leadership is a quality, not a designation. Wijetilleke possessed this quality which was in built in him. May his legacy of excellence and notably the leadership qualities with human touch which are unparalleled be an inspiration to all and the future generation.",
    "(The writer is the Past President of the HNB \u2013 Retired Employees Association.)"
