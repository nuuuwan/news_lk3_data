### CEB unions launch ‘critical’ protest campaign phase this Sunday

*2025-09-19 23:53:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/CEB-unions-launch-critical-protest-campaign-phase-this-Sunday/56-781950) · `en`

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) trade unions are set to begin the third stage of their industrial action against the proposed restructuring of the utility from midnight tomorrow, to run until 24 September.

Union leaders described the forthcoming phase as critical, saying its outcome will shape the direction of future protests and have implications for the energy sector.

The decision was announced by CEB Technicians’ Association Chairman Kosala Abeysinghe.

He said the move comes in response to what unions describe as the Government’s refusal to address their concerns.

“We have warned this Government to listen. This is a response to the arrogance of the Minister and the Director General in particular. But if the President continues to respond in the same way, we will be compelled to escalate matters further,” Abeysinghe said.

The union campaign started on 4 September with a work-to-rule action, followed by a sick-leave protest on 17 and 18 September.

### Wordy end of a vociferous parley in Qatar

Empty resolutions and threats are not going to save dying Palestinians

“Every people in the world lives in a place. For Palestinians the place lives in them” (Danny Rubinstein – an Israeli writer)

“We were herders of animals until we received the revelation, and then we became herders of other societies. We gave up the revelation and had become herds of other societies” (Allama Iqbal)

The extraordinary Arab-Islamic Summit held in Doha to counter Israel’s bombing of a government residential complex in the Leqtaifiya District of Qatar, where negotiations over a US initiated ceasefire proposal were in progress with representatives from Hamas, ended as usual in chest-thumping threats, condemnations and declarations against Israel, but without any concrete agenda of action to stop the genocide and expulsion of Palestinians from their homes before annexing Gaza and the West Bank to create Eretz Israel.
