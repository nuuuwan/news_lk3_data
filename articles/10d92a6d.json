    "Speaking during a press briefing held today, Jayasundara acknowledged that there are over 3,000 primary schools in Sri Lanka and that the academic year 2025 is slated to begin on January 27, 2025, emphasizing that an immediate decision will be communicated as soon as possible considering the fact that the children in question have to enter the Grade 06 based on the cut-off marks of this examination.",
    "He stated that the process of evaluation of answer sheets of the examination will be expedited for the prompt release of cut-off marks once the department reaches a final decision regarding the issue.",

    "Commenting further, he added: \u201cI received the Supreme Court decision today, a 68-page verdict. The court has ordered to choose the most appropriate recommendation and to implement it. This is being studied at length. I cannot immediately say which of the 3 options is the most appropriate. We need to study it.\u201d",
