  "original_body_lines": [
    "Airing candid views on the state of Sri Lanka\u2019s ailing economy, SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva told the media recently that he would rather go home having told the truth to the people than tell fancy lies to grab political power and push the economy and the people\u2019s lives into a greater abyss.",
    "Making comments that would serve more or less as public opinion guidance, the SJB economist went on to say,\u201d Today we are in a very grave situation. On the one hand, the policy action the government has taken to increase its revenue has put enormous pressure on the people. On the other hand, if the country doesn\u2019t increase its tax revenue, the EFF programme Sri Lanka has agreed with IMF to achieve fiscal sustainability over time may collapse. In such an event, when we can\u2019t manage on our own, who would step in to lend a hand and pull us through?\u201d",
    "\u201cSome people say that we can get the issues resolved through the help of \u2018Country A\u2019 or \u2018Country B\u2019. But it is justifiable to ask whether that \u2018Country A\u2019 or \u2018Country B\u2019 would step in to help us if we fall into an economic abyss that we dig for ourselves\u201d.",
    "\u201cNow an election is looming over us and the people may like to hear exciting legends. They would be hearing some sections say that \u2018we don\u2019t need help from the IMF because there is another way to raise revenue without imposing taxes. Or they may say they can bring in stolen public wealth worth USD 50-60 billion hidden by politicians in overseas safe havens, and use those funds to resuscitate the economy.",
    "Or they would say that national assets are a treasured legacy of the nation and they needn\u2019t be restructured for productivity. Further they would say any international trade and economic collaboration agreements would take the people\u2019s jobs away and the country would be deprived of its economic potential. They may say that they have a programme through which they can create a better future for the people. I think those stories would only be believable to people who don\u2019t understand any ground realities at all.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo what we need to decide at this point is; as different political parties, do we speak the truth to the people so that we can all unite and overcome the crisis or do we tell lies to the people again and show magic only to win the election and put the country in greater abyss? In such an eventuality, the country would be smashed to smithereens within 3-months leading to murder and mayhem on the roads. Or do we unite and work together like the tiny birds that shed the cruel hunter\u2019s net by taking flight together as one?\u201d",
    "Concluding his more pragmatic narrative as the election year is just about to dawn, he noted, \u201cAt a moment the country must act in a highly responsible manner, are the alternative political forces doing the right thing? That\u2019s an open question for all of us to ponder over. As a member of the SJB\u2019s economic committee, I am not prepared to relate far-fetched fancy stories to the people.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t say to the people that there is a way out of this crisis without economic reforms, without restructuring or without modernizing the outdated ways of our handling the economy. For me, it would be better to go home having told the truth to the people instead of deceiving and making the life even more miserable for millions of people putting them in their death throes.\u201d",
