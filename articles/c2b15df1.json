  "original_body_lines": [
    "People have long yearned for national development, but instead, they have experienced total economic collapse due to corrupt governance. As a result, the new government of the NPP, which is attempting to pull the country out of this abyss, faces serious challenges such as indebtedness, economic restrictions imposed by international financial institutions, and the loss of national sovereignty.",
    "For these reasons, the present government is compelled to pursue a type of development that is primarily profit- and growth-oriented. The benefits of such development do not trickle down to ordinary people, even though the World Bank claims the country is on the right path.",
    "This reality is evident in the lives of workers in foreign investment zones, who do not earn a living wage. Free healthcare and education are now being undermined. Since the benefits of growth are not equitably distributed, the gap between the haves and have-nots continues to widen.",
    "The dominant development model is largely urban-centered and has not expanded into rural areas. As a result, young men and women from rural communities are compelled to migrate in their thousands to investment zones in search of employment opportunities. Consequently, the population density in the Western Province continues to rise.",
    "Successive governments have failed to provide adequate services to these migrants. Despite high demand, governments have lacked the capacity to meet it. According to the dominant development model, people must purchase such services from the market. Hence, the current state of affairs has intensified the burden on low-income groups.",
    "The housing problem in Gampaha District clearly illustrates the social impact of current development processes. No government has had a plan or appointed an authority to look after the welfare of thousands of migrant workers in investment zones. During floods, relief was given to boarding-house owners but not to workers, with the argument that workers were outsiders and not residents.",
    "Many migrants, having left their homes for years, no longer have claims in their villages, nor do they own anything where they now live. This is especially true for young people from the plantation sector.",
    "Shelter is the most pressing issue they face upon arrival. They are expected to rent boarding rooms, which are often built without proper standards for ventilation or sanitation. Typically, 5\u20136 people share a single room.",
    "This situation has persisted in Gampaha since the 1980s and has steadily worsened. In places like Wattala, people have reclaimed marshy lands at their own expense to build houses. During floods, these homes are inundated because the ancient irrigation system in Muthurajawela has fallen into disrepair. Another complaint is that residents still have not received legal land titles.",
    "In some cases, 5\u20136 families live in a single house, creating constant quarrels. Privacy\u2014an essential requirement of family life\u2014is virtually nonexistent.",
    "Families who have lived in rented houses for 30\u201340 years share harrowing stories. A large portion of their income goes toward rent, leaving little for food, education, or other essentials.",
    "Because rental agreements last only one or two years, families are forced to move frequently and lack a permanent address. This creates difficulties when admitting children to schools or applying for jobs.",
    "They are not allowed to hold weddings or funerals in rented houses. Nor are they entitled to welfare benefits such as Samurdhi or Aswesuma. They are always treated as outsiders.",
    "If rent payments are delayed, they are threatened with eviction. Parents often skip meals in order to pay rent, leaving children without proper nutrition or school supplies.",
    "Housing is a basic human right. When it is not respected, several other rights are violated, including those related to privacy, health, environment, education, water, sanitation, security, dignity, life, and social inclusion.",
    "The UN\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) recognizes the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living:",
    "\u201cEveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one\u2019s family, including food, clothing, housing, medical care, and necessary social services.\u201d",
    "Similarly, Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights affirms the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living\u2014including food, clothing, and housing\u2014and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.",
    "Yet, in our country, thousands suffer from the lack of housing and shelter, particularly in Negombo, Wattala, Jaela, Katana, and Attanagalla in the Gampaha District.",
    "This is largely due to reductions in government welfare allocations as prescribed by international development agencies. Nevertheless, international institutions insist that governments are obliged to provide housing and essential services such as schools, healthcare, water, and sanitation. Today, even low-income groups must purchase all such services from the market.",
    "It has become clear that although current development processes generate economic growth, the benefits do not reach the poor. As a result, a large portion of the population is exposed to unbearable hardship.",
    "The policy statement of the NPP government has already declared its housing policy, which aims to provide comfortable housing facilities to all who need them.",
    "Proposed solutions include housing complexes, legal reforms to resolve land rights issues, and housing loan systems. Importantly, the NPP government has shown sensitivity to the housing needs of the people, giving them hope that solutions may finally be found.",
    "For years, people were told by authorities that land was \u201cavailable but not for you\u2014it is reserved for investors.\u201d Such statements deeply frustrated those seeking government intervention. It is now up to the NPP government to restore confidence by prioritizing the needs of the poor.",
    "The housing issue\u2014and other negative effects of development\u2014cannot be resolved without active participation from the people themselves.",
    "The poor and their elected representatives must sit together in dialogue. They must discuss problems, explore solutions, and clarify the contributions expected from both the people and the government. It is obvious that the government alone cannot provide houses to every family. People must therefore contribute toward solutions, though this is hindered by a dependence mentality that discourages action.",
    "Those affected by development often lack experience in advocacy or negotiation with leaders. They are accustomed instead to living in a \u201cculture of silence.\u201d As a result, housing and other problems remain unresolved unless public pressure is applied on the government.",
    "The people of Negombo, Wattala, Katana, Jaela, and Attanagalla propose that the government allocate land specifically for low-income housing needs in Gampaha District.",
    "Although the government\u2019s plan to construct flats is commendable, it does not suit the needs of this group of people. However, proposed legal reforms concerning land are welcome. Furthermore, appointing a district-level technical committee would expedite solutions to land issues.",
    "Low-income groups would also welcome government support in establishing housing cooperatives to obtain building materials at affordable prices."
