    "\u201cI have no doubt that this alliance between CIMA, and CA Sri Lanka will not only influence the prospects of our members, but it will also help strengthen the accounting and finance profession in Sri Lanka. I am certain today\u2019s agreement will be the beginning of a successful partnership,\u201d Bandara said.",
    "Melanie Janine Kanaka, the 89th CIMA President and Co-Chair of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, said, \u201cAICPA & CIMA and CA Sri Lanka have been working together for seven years and we are pleased to continue our collaboration. We know that the accounting and finance profession has significantly changed over the past decade. Through this enhanced agreement aspiring and existing accounting and finance professionals in Sri Lanka will be able to acquire the knowledge and competencies they need to build successful careers.\u201d",
