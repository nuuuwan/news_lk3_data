    "The talented Australian playmaker, who is set to play for Argentina after failing to make any impression with the Matildas (Jaz\u2019s mum is from Argentina), enjoyed three outstanding seasons in Scotland.",
    "She posted an emotional, heartfelt message to Celtic supporters last week, after her departure from the two time Scottish Cup winners was confirmed, as reported on\u00a0The Celtic Star.",
    "\u201cTo my Celtic family, where do I begin\u2026I can\u2019t thank you all enough, from my teammates, fans, staff and the whole club. I have been on an incredible journey with you all, and I will forever cherish all the memories I\u2019ve made at Celtic.",

    "With\u00a0Pam Tajonar\u00a0returning to play her football in her homeland of Mexico and\u00a0Tash Flint\u00a0deciding against a stay in Glasgow to instead sign for Liverpool the loss of fans favourite Jacynta was a further blow for the Celtic support after the thrilling end to the season resulting in that emphatic Scottish cup final win over\u00a0theRangers\u00a0at Hampden at the end of May.",
    "Both Glasgow City and\u00a0theRangers\u00a0have also been losing their top players as the higher profile achieved by the SWPL in the post split stage of the season, coupled by the matches being shown live on Sky Sports, has resulted in players getting very decent moves to bigger leagues.",
    "We certainly wish Jacynta all the best for her time in Sporting \u00a0it was always a pleasure to speak to her over the past few seasons and she certainly leaves us as a better player than when she arrived.",
    "But alas to Portugual she had to go\u2026and we now know where her boyfriend Carl Starfelt will be going his holidays!"
