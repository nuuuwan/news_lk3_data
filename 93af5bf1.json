    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s consumer affairs authority (CAA) will take \u201cnecessary action\u201d about the shortages of keeri samba in the market, minister of trade, commerce and food security Nalin Fernando said.",
    "Complaints that keeri samba, a premium domestic rice, had disappeared from supermarket shelves have been circulating for months.",
    "Fernando accused rice mill owners of not releasing rice stocks to the market.",
    "\u201cThere is an issue with keeri samba. For about a month and a half keeri samba has not been issued to the market. Three major rice mill owners are trying to artificially hike prices to exorbitant levels.\u201d",
    "If the shortage persists \u201cwe will take a decision to import the quantities needed\u201d Fernando told reporters.",
    "Goods usually go off the shelf and black markets are created due to government price controls, which prevents a market clearing price from being established.",
    "The CAA had earlier made eggs, tinned fish, dhaal, wheat flour, disappear from shelves with its price controls, and bankrupted layer chicken farmers. (Colombo/Nov20/2023)"
