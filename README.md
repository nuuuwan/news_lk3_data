### Sri Lanka central bank buys US$781mn less to August 2025 than last year

*2025-09-15 05:30:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-buys-us781mn-less-to-august-2025-than-last-year-240490/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank bought 142.5 million US dollars from commercial banks in August 2025, taking the total so far this year to 1,238.6 million US dollars so far this year, official data show.

In 2024, the central bank bought 2020.4 million US dollars in the same period with stronger deflationary policy and lower private credit.

In late 2024 the central bank re-started inflationary policy through aggressive open market operations to mis-target the interbank rate, as private credit picked up, leading to sharply reduced collections in November and December.

However, in 2025, there was no inflationary policy per se, other than dollar-rupee buy-sell swaps. Dollar purchases were also unsterilized under the latest phase of the IMF program no longer requiring a sell down of CB held g-secs, which analysts say is a mistake.

நாடு என்ற ரீதியில் நாம் 2028ஆம் ஆண்டு முதல் ஆண்டுதோறும் 5.6 பில்லியன் டொலர் கடனை மீள செலுத்த வேண்டும். அதற்கு பொருளாதார வளர்ச்சியை 5 சதவீதமாக பேணிச் செல்ல வேண்டும். எனினும் இதுவரை நாம் அந்த இலக்கை எட்டவில்லை. இந்தப் பிரச்சினைகளுக்கு குறுகிய காலத்துக்குள் பதில்களை தேட வேண்டியது அவசியமாகும் என எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவர் சஜித் பிரேமதாச தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

அனுராதபுரம், விலச்சிய பிரதேச செயலாளர் பிரிவில் ஞாயிற்றுக்கிழமை (14) இடம்பெற்ற நிகழ்வொன்றில் கலந்து கொண்டு உரையாற்றிய போது இதனைத் தெரிவித்த அவர் மேலும் குறிப்பிடுகையில்,

இன்று நாட்டில் விவசாயம் செய்வது கடினமானதொன்றாக மாறிவிட்டது. உயர்தர உரமோ அல்லது உர மானியங்களோ கிடைத்தபாடில்லை. மலிவு விலையில் வேளாண்மைக்கான இரசாயன பொருட்கள் கிடைத்தபாடில்லை. உபகரணங்களின் விலை அதிகரிப்பிற்கு மத்தியில், உற்பத்திச் செலவுகளும் அதிகரித்துள்ளன. இவற்றோடு யானை-மனித மோதல் போன்ற காரணங்களால் கடுமையான பிரச்சினைகளை எதிர்கொண்டு சிரமங்களுக்கு மத்தியில் விவசாயம் இடம்பெற்று வருகிறது. ஆனாலும் இன்று நெல் அறுவடைக்கு உத்தரவாத  விலை கூட கிடைக்காத நிலையே காணப்படுகின்றது.

மாகாண சபைத் தேர்தலை விரைவாக நடத்த வேண்டும் என்ற நிலைப்பாட்டில் உறுதியாகவுள்ளோம்.மாகாண சபைகள் மக்கள் பிரதிநிதிகள் இல்லாமல், அரச அதிகாரிகளால் நிர்வகிக்கப்படுவது ஜனநாயக அம்சங்களுககு அப்பாற்பட்டது என்பதையும் ஏற்றுக்கொள்கிறோம்.

மாகாண சபைத் தேர்தலை பழைய தேர்தல் முறையில் நடத்துவதா அல்லது புதிய தேர்தல் முறையில் நடத்துவதா என்பது பாரியதொரு பிரச்சினையாக காணப்படுகிறது.இந்த பிரச்சினைக்கு பாராளுமன்றத்தின் ஊடாக தீர்வு காண வேண்டும் என்று உயர்நீதிமன்றம் பலமுறை அறிவுறுத்தியுள்ளது.மாகாண சபைத் தேர்தலை நடத்துவதற்கு உரிய நடவடிக்கைகளை மேற்கொள்வோம். இருப்பினும் தேர்தலை நடத்தும் திகதியை நிச்சயமாக குறிப்பிட முடியாது.

### Repeal of Presidents’ Entitlements Act: Reform or retrospective punishment?

In considering the repeal of the Presidents’ Entitlements Act, the nation must weigh the difference between cutting extravagance and eroding respect. Historical judgment is unforgiving, and societies are often remembered not just for their policies but for their treatment of those who served them at great personal cost. Stripping entitlements retroactively, however well-intentioned, risks leaving a record of pettiness rather than prudence

In recent months, the repeal of Sri Lanka’s Presidents’ Entitlements Act has sparked intense debate across political and social circles. At first glance, the move seems a demonstration of fiscal prudence—a government taking decisive steps to curb what many perceive as excessive privileges.

### Independent central bank is for citizens and not for politicians

Three years ago, in 2022, inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index or CCPI was running on average at about 63% and the official exchange rate was unstable with a lucrative black market for foreign currencies. All indications were that Sri Lanka, unless proper policies would be adopted, would descend to a basket case like Lebanon. This did not happen because the central bank’s management, with financial as well as policy support of the International Monetary Fund or IMF, was able to tame the rising inflation and keep the exchange rate at a stable level

In a recent talk show titled ‘Modern Talk’ hosted by Channel 7 television, successor to the former YA Television, the young talk show hostess Nimna Perera asked me whether the current central bank management had been doing its job properly in managing the economy.1

Both students in Bangla and youth in Nepal were ultimately represented by small groups the military accepted and were projected as instruments of change

In Bangladesh and in Nepal, though with commonalities in the initial “leaderless” single issue protests, establishing a new rule was different to Sri Lanka and remains unconstitutional too. From nowhere a few youth in Bangladesh claiming to represent the university student protest and accepted as such by the military usurped the right to nominate Muhammud Yunus, the former head of the Grameen Bank as interim PM. He was in self-exile in France, and there were no indications of any discussions and dialogue among students and protesting groups, on who should head the interim government and how it should be constituted

However, the Sri Lanka Small and Medium Scale Paddy Mill Owners’ Association is requesting that no steps be taken to remove the maximum retail price of rice as they claim that large-scale rice mill owners are trying to create an artificial shortage of rice and gain profits.

Meanwhile, the National Farmers’ Union says that the government should intervene immediately and provide solutions to this issue.

In answering her question, I summarily told her that the central bank is an independent organisation as mandated by the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act or CBA and, under the mandate given to it by the new legislation, it is doing perfectly well in taming inflation and restoring the stability of the exchange rate. However, it requires further elaboration.

*2025-09-14 20:21:49* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/importance-of-sri-lankan-studies-in-school-university-curricula-a-justice-oriented-civic-transformation/) · `en`

The Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka has announced a national education reform initiative scheduled for implementation in 2026. Within this context, this paper argues for the integration of Sri Lankan Studies as a compulsory subject at both secondary and tertiary levels of education. The rationale derives from comparative international experiences where structured national studies such as American Studies, Chinese Studies, and Russian Studies are institutionalized to cultivate civic consciousness, strengthen national identity, and enhance democratic participation. Sri Lanka, despite its complex postcolonial trajectory and protracted ethnic conflict, lacks a coherent academic framework that synthesizes its history, cultural plurality, political institutions, and developmental challenges. Existing subjects such as Civic Education remain fragmented, outdated, and inadequate in fostering justice-oriented citizenship.

### ADB’s water brings life to Vavuniya, but affordability crisis looms for the poor

For the women of Vavuniya’s rural outskirts, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) didn’t just lay pipes; it gifted them time. It returned to them the hours once spent in a daily, desperate pilgrimage for water.

Before 2009, their lives were defined by the walk to the well – a journey that often ended in disappointment, with dry pumps and empty pots. Their children, parched, sometimes missed school. Their husbands, daily-wage labourers earning a median of Rs. 2,000 a day, left for work with anxiety weighing as heavy as the tropical sun.

Today, the turn of a tap brings a clean, steady flow, a miracle made possible by the ADB’s $40 million investment under the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project. This ambitious scheme replaced a defunct system, constructing a new dam and a modern treatment plant that now delivers safe, potable water to 80,000 people. The physical transformation is undeniable; a feat of engineering that ended a decades-long water crisis.

### Bond standoff: Banks swim in cash but shun government debt

*2025-09-14 17:34:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/bond-standoff-banks-swim-in-cash-but-shun-government-debt/) · `en`

A standoff is brewing between Sri Lanka’s monetary authority and bond market participants, as cash-rich banks show a reluctant appetite for government securities. This was evident in the September 11, 2025 Treasury bond auction, where the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raised only a portion of its targeted funds, with a significant shortfall in a key maturity.

This caution exists alongside signs of economic resilience. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew 6.4% year-on-year in July 2025, driven by surges in petroleum refining (166.7%), apparel manufacturing (16.2%), and non-metallic mineral products (15.9%).

Amid this growth, the banking sector is flush with cash. Total outstanding market liquidity swelled to a surplus of Rs. 178.58 billion by September 12, 2025. However, this liquidity is not flowing aggressively into government bonds.
