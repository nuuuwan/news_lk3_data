    "Veterinarians had prepared to airlift the Asian elephant from Sri Lanka back to its home country of Thailand this weekend after it spent more than two decades at a Buddhist temple.",
    "The Thai royal family gave the elephant as a gift in 2001 to Sri Lanka\u2019s government, which in turn gifted it to the temple where it was named Muthu Raja and given honored roles in religious processions.",
    "However, the activist group Rally for Animal Rights and Environment, or RARE, raised allegations it was being mistreated, including that it had a stiff leg from a long-neglected injury.",

    "Visit Arsaithamkul, a visiting Thai veterinarian, said the treatment in Thailand could include hydrotherapy, laser treatment and acupuncture.",
    "At the zoo, Muthu Raja\u2019s morning routine had included veterinarian check-ups, bathing in a small pond and practice getting into the container that will carry him on the nearly six-hour flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand.",
    "The container is cushioned and has windows for feeding \u2014 which will include bananas, pumpkin and sugar cane. Zoo officials have hoisted the 9-foot-tall, 4-ton creature in trial lifts to test the container\u2019s strength.",
    "Muthu Raja \u2014 also known back in its birthplace as Sak Surin \u2014 will be sedated if needed, and two vets will monitor him during the journey. Three Thai and one Sri Lanka elephant tenders also will be on the plane.",
    "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told Parliament earlier this month that he expressed his regret to the Thai prime minister over the treatment of the elephant during trip to Thailand in May."
