    "\u201cDo not earn your living by harming others \u2026. Do not seek happiness by making others unhappy.\u201d",
    "The Virtue of a Good Buddhist is not that difficult to understand as it is plain simplicity and what we must try to achieve is a state of mind that is open all the time with the capacity to understand and adjust it to accept, as such can start reasons that shall be capable of creating pain that would be the cause for suffering.Needless to say that no one likes pain.In order to have such qualities, one can never be selfish as the happiness that may come to one can be creating enough pain to others.Any person with normal capacity to understand the impact that would have been created with selfish intentions would cause pain. It is the result of a person who may develop aspirations.It starts with one\u2019s thinking only. If one can understand the negative impact, it shall not be done.",
    "So, we must be conscious because, in the same manner we ,may suffer due to selfish actions of others, others may suffer due to selfish actions of ours.As all the negative things that may happen, we are in a position to avoid such.",
    "Looking around, not as a mindless \u2018robot\u2019 but a normal human being who is not physically handicapped or not shall never miss anything but instead would note, understand and grasp, if there is something that calls for one\u2019s attention, and would start wondering if there is something expected of him or her to be concerned, because he or she is gifted with an ability to be observant and can always be developing \u2018Life Skills\u2019 that can be classified as the following \u2013",
    "Being able to have the right view that shall be linked to right thinking giving the ability to express correctly and thereby being able to do the right things when taking action and that in turn would fashion the right kind of living to form the base to make him or her to be of right efforts and they become the eight main principles that would create the character of an ideal person. They are the factors of awakening. Our Lord Buddha simplified the total responsibility of a Human Being and it consisted of the cardinal ways of life.",

    "The Five Precepts: Ethical guidelines for lay practitioners, including refraining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxicants.",
    "All those are the natural realities that act as laws that guide us by making us to always remember that we have recognise and respect the reality that we have to be conscious about our duty to ensure that we must that our obligations are not forgotten . In the same manner , we must understand that what we commit to ourselves and also to others must also be fulfilled. There, we have to be aware about the priorities and that they must be achieved effectively .",
    "At the same time, we have to win over the trust of others and that can happen only by proving it ourselves.",
    "All the time, we have to do things and be exemplary and that way we shall be recognised for what we are, and we shall be examples for what we do and what we are.",
    "The impression we leave in the minds of others shall always be the symbols for quality when it comes to what we do professionally for the work we do and that way as the persons.",
    "We shall be accountable for whatever we may undertake so that those who support us shall have no doubts or worries thinking about us and when all those qualities decorate us, we shall always have futures about which we can be more confident.",
    "Having being cultivating such qualities about our characters, we should be free to reflect about what we have done in the past so that we shall not miss the successes and failures we had achieved or completed and all those will be Teachers reminding us about our successes as well as the failures. Such practices shall not be difficult as",
    "We have gone through all those very casually and without taking those as burdens. The experience we have gained shall be very pleasant and shall give more confidence.",
    "That way, we shall integrate with the others , and our seriousness in our work would have served as examples for others too. See how lightly we have taken our lives and the work we had to do to make that life a pleasant experience",

    "In both the verses, the First Line says \u2018Everything happens as the Mind Causes 02nd Line in the First Verse means all the Negative things that will happen will be like the heavy burden like the loaded cart that goes behind the Ox while the Second line in the First Verse says is that shall have a heavy and a painful end while the soft and light weightless load will be like like a silhouette ending with happen the Second line in the Second Verse",
    "Those two verses describe a very crucial point in Buddhism. Before everything is that mind is at the forefront and that all the actions of people are the results of what they had thought. If the thinking had been negative, then, definitely, the result would be lime in the first Verse that is equaled to the Loaded Cart that is following the Ox. If the Actions are the results of benevolent thinking, then , it shall be like soothing silhouette.",
    "Anything can happen as something spoken or done and depending on whether one speaks (bh\u0101sati) and acts (kar\u014dti) may result as something spoken or an act of ill-feelings (padu\u1e6d\u1e6dha) or a as the results of a pleasant (pasanna) mind. The Nature of those\u00a0happenings that are generated by the mind lead to (tat\u014d nam) suffering (dukkhamanv\u0113ti), or happiness (sukhamanv\u0113ti), depending on the manner the actions took place.",
    "It is a very interesting our Lord Buddha had explained a very serious situation and the example given is still valid.",
    "In the case of a sick and confused minds acting with\u00a0desires l\u014dbha leading to erroneous acts \u2013 \u2018d\u014dsa\u2019 , and to be mentally confused -\u2019m\u014dha\u2019 , shall bring in \u2018 suffering \u2019 that shall follow just as the wheels of a cart that follow the way the ox would be pulling it (cakkamva vahat\u014d padam).",
    "But in the case of a pleasant, a peaceful and a moral mind that shall be free of desires l\u014dbha leading to erroneous acts \u2013 \u2018d\u014dsa\u2019 , and to be mentally confused -\u2019m\u014dha\u2019 , shall bring in \u2018 suffering \u2019 shall follow one just as one\u2019s own shadow that follows \u2013 ch\u0101y\u0101va anap\u0101yani.",
    "It is very natural that all the human beings being exposed to develop their liking towards various things that may be physical as well as things not physical..In order to have a better capacity to understand the principles, we can have two main categories of human beings who lean towards the paths shown in Buddhism, we can easily note two main types. One type is those who take things very very seriously, and they want things sorted out things in more detail. The other type is made up of the majority who are more concerned about the practicalities in real life. The First Type is made up of devotees who want to reach real salvation- The Nirwana of Nibbana.",
    "As a person who belongs to the First category, I have committed myself to be an exemplary ascetic. At the same time, I cannot avoid noting the realities in trying to grasp the serious matters raised. While not trying to escape the rigors that can be anticipated in becoming an exemplary monk, I can see the importance in convincing more to be embraced in Buddhism. It is going to be highly complicated in a World that has now become more sophisticated than before. In principles , life the foundation for the base to understand has not changed,even with the most advanced aspects that come connected to the discoveries made by the Great Scientists.",
    "It begins with the \u2018Mind\u2019 that is the energizer and we have to be more broad minded to be fitting.It id a world that has become a confusion. The economies that have become the nurturing bases cannot be changed just like that.",
    "What the lay people have to understand is the fact that it is the core principles that form and fashion our lives that matter. In a practical world we cannot force upon the ways and means and the ages old traditions have kept in encroaching in to the most sensitive aspects in life, touching in even the details.",
    "Coming back to the very principles, we must understand that it has to become more exemplary than by chasing compulsion. We can easily change our habits and they shall never make drastic changes.Especially when we take food habits, we can see that we can make ourselves more confident in changing our routine practices.",
    "Before we start on the need to become good practising Buddhists, we can concentrate on the \u2018Morals\u2019 that are actually more symbolic and are aspects that can be easily controlled by our minds.",
    "There are possibilities to get away from most of the Non Buddhist ways without our feeling.",
    "Let us adjust our ways to prove the point that Buddhists are never extremists.The main theme is to be tolerant.Let us learn to enjoy the sentiments to respect others.",
    "Let the Laws of the Nation worry about maintaining the Law and Order and we can support such by our becoming law abiding.",
    "Can we have differences among ourselves, if we can respect and believe in a Buddhist Teaching, like the one below ?",
