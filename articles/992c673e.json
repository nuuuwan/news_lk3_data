    "A spectacular celestial event is set to light up the skies on September 7, as the Moon undergoes a total lunar eclipse, turning an eerie, deep red for 82 minutes.",
    "Known as a Blood Moon, this will be the last total lunar eclipse of the year and is expected to be visible to nearly 77% of the global population. Unlike many eclipses confined to specific regions, this phenomenon will be observable across much of Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa, with Sri Lanka offering some of the clearest views.",
    "Stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts across Sri Lanka have been advised to prepare for a breathtaking celestial event as a total lunar eclipse graces the night sky on September 7.",
    "This spectacular event will be entirely visible from all parts of the island, offering a rare opportunity to witness the full splendour of a \u201cblood moon\u201d said Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, the Head of the Department of Physics and Director, Astronomy and Space Science Unit of the University of Colombo and the Chairman of the Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies, Katubedda.",
    "Lunar eclipses happen when Earth is between the sun and a full moon.\u00a0 This celestial phenomenon will see the full moon pass directly behind the Earth and into its shadow, gradually transforming its silvery glow into a striking reddish hue. The entire eclipse, from the initial penumbral phase to the final moments, will be observable across the country if the sky is without clouds.",
    "The key timings for the total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025, for Sri Lanka are as follows:"
