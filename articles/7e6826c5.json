  "original_title": "Two more opposition MPs quit COPE",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "MPs Prof. Charitha Herath and S.M. Marikkar have also decided to resign from the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), bringing the total number of opposition members to quit the parliamentary committee thus far to four.",
    "In a post on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter), former COPE chairman Prof. Herath said he has officially communicated his decision to the Speaker of Parliament today (19).",
    "SJB parliamentarian Marikkar also announced his decision to step down today (19).",
    "Their resignation comes after SJB parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne and MP Dayasiri Jayasekara also decided to quit the committee.",
    "Wickramaratne announced his decision to resign yesterday and in his letter of resignation explained that no credible action had been taken on those who were found to have been complicit in corrupt practices or mismanagement despite the COPE reports submitted to the parliament time and time again.",
    "He also took issue with the appointment of Rohitha Abeygunawardena, a ruling party MP, as the COPE chairman despite the previous government adopting a practice of appointing an Opposition member to chair the committee to strengthen the principle that the legislature must be a check and balance on the executive arm of government.",
    "In addition, Wickramaratne highlighted that it is dissatisfying that members who have been appointed to COPE have allegations against their personal conduct, particularly on financial transactions and that this also contributes to the citizen\u2019s loss of confidence in Parliament."
