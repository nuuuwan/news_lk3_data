### Poverty of CBSLтАЩs monetary policies: Part II

*2024-11-27 06:09:04* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Poverty-of-CBSL-s-monetary-policies-Part-II/4-769738) ┬╖ `en`

High domestic interest rates on Government debt, combined with the absence of Central Bank intervention to purchase newly issued debt, will escalate the domestic debt servicing burden

The present article expands on the loss of control by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) of interest rates that we developed in Part I. In Part I the focus was money market or short-term interest rates. In the present article the focus is long-term interest rates, particularly interest rates on long-term Government debt.

The article makes two key points in this regard. Firstly, the CBSL has not only lost control over money market or short-term interest rates, as argued in Part I, but also over long-term interest rates, specifically those on long-term Government debt i.e., on Government debt exceeding one year. Secondly, this loss of control stems partly from the CBSLтАЩs inability to regulate short-term money market rates and partly from the provisions of the new Central Bank Act (CBA) passed in 2023.

### Blunder by new Government: No fertiliser to paddy farmers

The current GovernmentтАЩs biggest blunder is the neglect of fertiliser to paddy farmers

Over the past few weeks, TV channel тАШDeranaтАЩ reported on a number of occasions, the plight of the paddy farmers in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Amparai districts due to non-availability of fertiliser for their paddy cultivation. But the Government TV channels were silent over the issue.

Maha rainy season started in early October as usual and will continue until early January. Rains start in early October during the evenings and intensity will increase reaching a maximum in December and rains will end in early January, allowing the farmers to harvest from late January onwards.

The paddy farmers prepare fields after first rains having softened the grounds, mostly with tractors. With increase in rains, fields become muddy and are prepared for sowing of seed paddy generally in early November.

The symbolic exclusion signalled by the missing Muslim at the highest level of governance is significant and no amount of patronising rhetoric about our collective Sri Lankanness is going to address this sense of exclusion

The change that the new election has brought to the country is unprecedented.

Historically, since independence, we have only had 5% representation at any given moment. Now we have close to 10%. And that too through elections and only one through the national list.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the formulation of an Interim Budget to cover the GovernmentтАЩs expenses during the first four months of 2025.

It will focus on relevant expenses for Government recurrent and capital expenses, public debt servicing, and loan restructuring.

The move comes as the new Parliament which convened on 21 November lacked sufficient time to complete the constitutional steps required for passing the full Appropriation Bill for 2025.

Therefore, as stipulated in sub-section 23(1) of the Public Finance Management Act No 44 of 2024, an interim Budget should be submitted to Parliament to allocate provisions for the continuation of currently implemented projects and public services for the first 4 months of 2025.

The proposal to this effect presented by the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs central bank will announce a single overnight policy rate from November 27, instead of the current policy corridor involving standing deposit facilities, the monetary authority said.

The standing lending and deposit facilities, will remain as a margin to the announced overnight policy rate.

The central bank will continue to target an average call money rate with liquidity operations.

Critics have warned that the denial monetary stability, especially from 2015, which led to serial currency crises, borrowing to repay debt, borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum for current transactions, was a consequence of excess money printed to target a mid-corridor rate (a de facto single policy rate).

Sri Lanka has been running broadly deflationary policy from around September 2022, withdrawing liquidity through outright transactions, but concerns have been raised at initial inflationary policy through its overnight and term operations.
