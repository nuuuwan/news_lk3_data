The garden's worker and his assistants were shocked by the fact that the plantation manager and his assistants attacked the garden.

### Growing disconnect of political elite and the President’s shrinking political options

*2024-05-21 02:44:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Growing-disconnect-of-political-elite-and-the-President-s-shrinking-political-options/4-762049) · `en`

The present moment in Sri Lankan politics is one where the campaign strategies of the major political parties appear to be shifting to a new phase. As the possibility of elections gets higher, encounters among different political factions are entering a more intensified phase of confrontation. With the gears shifting, there appears to be little political movement and considerable ambiguity, which translates into voter confusion.

However, a deeper scrutiny of recent political events are indicative of three main tectonic shifts in the political landscape: excessive exercise of power by the establishment elite, the President’s increasingly shrinking political options with the Rajapaksas signalling possible departure, and the National People’s Power’s (NPP) mobilising a series of trade union strikes.

Mr Editor, please give me a little space in your esteemed newspaper to enlighten a man who deliberately misled the readers by covering up the many vain deeds of Mahinda Rajapaksa (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Restructure-SriLankan-Airlines-but-no-mandate-for-sale/4-761891).

One of the most unpardonable deeds was to destroy a profit-making SriLankan Airline with a track record of accident-free flying. True it was CBK who successfully negotiated and brought in Emirates as a partner. The airline was running profitably with a foreign national as its head when MR assumed office as President.

### One more in the long line of rejections

The Sunday Times on 19 May carried the Foreign Ministry’s reactions on the OHCHR report on ‘enforced disappearances’ in Sri Lanka (https://www.sundaytimes.lk/240519/news/lanka-strongly-rejects-un-report-questions-its-mandate-and-timing-557860.html). It says Sri Lanka is rejecting the report.

This may be one more in the long line of rejections since the days of Gotabaya Presidency.

Interestingly, questions have been raised about the authority or mandate of the High Commissioner to issue such a report. But in their heady rush to reject the report, they may not have consulted important resolutions including the UNGA resolution establishing the post of High Commissioner.

These resolutions particularly stress the importance of the role of the High Commissioner as the voice of humanity on gross or grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, how the High Commissioner should express that voice and what format or method should be followed is left open.

Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and Hamas’s leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has applied for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes.

Karim Khan KC said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October onwards.

Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with the group’s military chief Mohammed Deif, are also wanted for arrest.

ICC judges will now decide whether they believe the evidence is sufficient to issue arrest warrants - something which could take weeks or months.

Netanyahu said in a statement that he rejected “with disgust The Hague prosecutor’s comparison between democratic Israel and the mass murderers of Hamas”.

### Social media comes to the fore in Indian elections

Chiefly YouTube, has emerged as the main mode of political communication overshadowing the traditional or “mainstream” electronic media

The 2024 Indian parliamentary elections will be remembered for many reasons. They are the longest to date, stretching from April 19 to June 1.

They are taking place in the midst of acute unemployment, skyrocketing prices and lack of demand in the market.

An unprecedented amount of money is being spent amidst corruption charges.  Divisive issues of caste, religion and region are being racked up. Sex scandals are sullying the reputations of some of the high and mighty.

But in the midst of the darkness, there is a silver lining. Social media platforms, chiefly YouTube, have emerged as the main mode of political communication, overshadowing the traditional or “mainstream” electronic media.

### Elections must be decided only by law - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-21 01:48:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Elections-must-be-decided-only-by-law-EDITORIAL/172-282991) · `en`

The elections in Sri Lanka are said to be conducted in a free and fair manner and according to the law. However, some laws have been promulgated in a manner that ruling parties can manipulate the law in their favour.

The Sri Lankan Constitution states “The President of the Republic shall be elected by the people and shall hold office for a term of five years.” It again says “The poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.”

Accordingly, the Election Commission (EC) on May 9 announced that the Presidential polls will be held between September 17 and October 16, this year. The Commission’s announcement was based on the country’s law and hence election could not be held before that period or postponed for a date after it.

### ICC chief prosecutor seeks Netanyahu, Hamas leaders’ arrest

(AP) — The chief prosecutor of the world’s top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war.

While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened Israel’s isolation over the war in Gaza.

The court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders — Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas.

### Share market dogged by dullness as parliament dissolution worries persist

The stock market yesterday indicated some selling pressure, due to the absence of micro and macro- economic factors to boost it. These factors accounted for the market remaining dull the whole day, market analysts explained.

Apparently, worries mainly over the dissolution of Parliament for the conduct of an election soon compounded the market’s selling pressure.

Amid those developments both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 75.73 points while S and P SL 20 declined by 24.54 points. Turnover stood at Rs 1 billion with one crossing. The crossing was reported in Sampath Bank, which crossed 1 million shares to the tune of Rs 78 million; its shares traded at Rs 78.

### The Beautiful Terrible Signs: The Ongoing Saga Of Rheumatic Heart Disease

Every physician likely recalls an unforgettable moment from his or her clinical rotation as a medical student that profoundly impacted him or her, leaving an indelible mark. For me it was the encounter with a patient suffering from Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis in India. In fact, it was the presence of my larger-than-life clinical professor that made the moment even more memorable. His mesmerizing descriptions of the clinical signs, such as “opening snap,” “rumbling mid-diastolic murmur,” and “presystolic accentuation,” along with precise timing between the second heart sound and the opening snap, had elevated the experience to another level. However, amidst my fascination, I must confess, I had failed to recognize the true gravity of these signs—their reflection of extreme suffering on the part of the patient. It never even once occurred to me then that these captivating signs were, in fact, manifestations of medical failure, the root cause behind them.

“The market was down, possibly a consolidation phase after last week’s run on penny stocks,” market participants said. “It’s also a short week.”

“Additionally, there is the monetary policy review due next Tuesday so not a lot of buying interest overall.”

However, bluechip stocks were holding their value, they said. “This is mainly because the earnings that are being posted are very good.”

John Keells Holdings Plc was up at 206.00, Sampath Bank Plc was up at 78.00, and Hayleys Plc was up at 92.70.

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and seven others have been further remanded until June 03 by the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court.

They are facing charges related to the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail.
