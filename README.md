### සූර්ය ආලෝකය පතිතවීම සදහටම නතර වුවහොත් කුමක් සිදු වෙයිද ?

*2024-04-09 21:14:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/195485) · `si`

මහ පොළොවට සූර්ය ආලෝකය පතිතවීම සදහටම නතර වුවහොත් කුමක් සිදුවේද ? යන්න බොහෝ කලක සිට නැඟුණු ප්‍රශ්නයකි.

ඊට සුප්‍රකට තාරකා විද්‍යාඥයෙකු වූ කාල් සාගන් මෙවැනි පිළිතුරක් ලබාදී තිබුණි.

දිනක් තුළ ගස්වැල් සියල්ල මැරීයාම ආරම්භ වනවා වගේම මහපොළොවේ සියලු ස්වභාවික ජෛව විවිධත්වයන් නැතිවී යාම අපේක්ෂා කළ හැකිය.

හිරුඑළිය නැතිවීමත් සමග ප්‍රභාසංස්ලේෂණය වහා නතර වුවත් ශක්තිය ගබඩා කර ඇති දැවැන්ත ශාකවලට වසර කිහිපයක් පැවතිය හැකි වෙයි.

සතියක් තුළ පෘථිවියේ උෂ්ණත්වය සෙල්සියස් අංශක 0 දක්වා පහත වැටීමත්, හිරුඑළිය නොමැති නිසා තාපය මුදාහැරීමෙන් පොළව ශීත වීමත් අත්දැකිය හැකිවේවි.

වසරක් තුළ පෘථිවියේ උෂ්ණත්වය සෙල්සියස් අංශක ඍණ 73 දක්වා පහත වැටීමත්, වසර තුනක් තුළ සාගර සියල්ල අයිස් බවට පත්වීමත් අපේක්ෂා කළ හැකිය.

කෙසේ නමුත් වායුගෝලයේ ගබඩා වී ඇති ඔක්සිජන් හේතුවෙන් මිනිසාට තවත් වසර දහස් ගණනක් ජීවය පවත්වා ගැනීමට හැකියාව පවතින බව කාල් සාගන්ගේ අදහසය.

එහෙත් හිරුඑළිය ගස්වැල් ජල ධාරා නොමැති ලෝකයක් ගැන අපට මනෝ චිත්‍රයක් මවාගැනීම අපහසුය.

පෘථිවිවාසීන් හිරු මුළුමණින්ම මුවා වූ පූර්ණ සූර්යග්‍රහණයක අත්දැකීමක් ඊයේ විඳ ගත්තේය.

### International court rules Switzerland violated human rights in landmark climate case brought by 2,000 women

An international court in France on Tuesday ruled Switzerland’s failure to adequately tackle the climate crisis was in violation of human rights, in a landmark climate judgment that could have a ripple effect across the globe.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, France delivered its ruling in a case brought by more than 2,000 Swiss women, the majority of whom are in their 70s, against Switzerland’s government. They argued that climate change-fueled heat waves undermined their health and quality of life, and put them at risk of dying.

The court ruled that the Swiss government had violated some of the women’s human rights due to “critical gaps” in its national legislation to reduce planet-heating emissions, as well as a failure to meet past climate targets.

This amounted to a breach of the women’s rights to effective protection from the “the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives, health, well-being and quality of life,” the court said in a statement.
