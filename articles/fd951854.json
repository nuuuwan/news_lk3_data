    "2023 was an incredibly tough year, we have experienced quite a number of challenges faced by our members and BOI companies due to recessive trends globally, compounded by the crippling local financial crisis. The looming economic slowdown in Europe and the USA, our major export destinations, poses a severe threat to our exports. In addition, the increase in corporate and personal taxes, unfavourable forex rates, and the abnormal increase in the cost of commodities, particularly energy, have caused our production costs to skyrocket, eroding our global competitiveness.",
    "As a result, our export figures have taken a hit, and many major industrial exporters are downsizing, shutting down operations, or relocating. The SME sector has been particularly hard-hit, with the withdrawal of loan moratoriums and the contraction of large-scale enterprises having a cascading effect.",
    "Association always ensured that all BOI enterprises were maintaining a sustainable business and being resilient especially during the economic crisis by minimising their exposure to risks and finding new ways in which they can maintain the sustainability of their business. The crisis which prevailed in the 1st half of the year had challenged many organisations; however we were able to find solutions ensuring the continuous operation of the companies by taking collective decisions with officials of the BOI and all other stakeholders.",
    "Our relationship with BOI over the past years influenced us to overcome new challenges and leverage complementary assets to address Investors\u2019 problems. As a result, FTZMA has become a member of the Industry Advisory Council of BOI.",
    "Besides with BOI, we maintain cordial relationships with other statutory bodies such as Customs, Central Bank, Ports authority, Airport and non-State sector organisations as well.

We also value the cooperation of EFC, CCC, NCC, NGJA, SLSC and all other sister trade chambers and our affiliated associations.",
    "I would like to express my gratitude to the member enterprises, who are the strength of our association, for their steadfast support, and to the Executive Committee colleagues and our dynamic Chairman for their unwavering dedication. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of our secretariat staff for their exceptional efforts in supporting the increase of membership and the smooth functioning of our office.",
    "FTZMA strongly believes that our country will be able recover from the current difficult economic situation faced by our members and if the Government would formulate investor friendly policies and take action in the right direction to foster the socio-economic progress of Sri Lanka and will bring back confidence of all investors,\u201d and the Association ensures that continuous and smooth operation of the activities and most importantly sustain the industry by satisfying the investor.
