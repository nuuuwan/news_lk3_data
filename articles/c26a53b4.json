    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s gross foreign reserves grew to 6,166 million dollars in August 2025, rising 19 million US dollars, official data showed, amid concerns over the pace of reserve collections and rate cuts.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves is down 306 million dollars from October 2024, when the central bank began running inflationary policy operating an abundant reserve regime (single policy rate), injecting vast amounts of liquidity to target a short-term rate.",
    "As a result, by December the agency barely collect 12 million dollars from markets.",
    "The central bank in the first quarter withdrew some of the liquidity, as credit slowed and it was able to buy dollars, but concerns have been raised about the lack of active deflationary policy to collect more reserves.",
    "The central bank gets interest on its bond portfolio, which is a legacy of securities acquisitions it did from 2019-2022 to keep rates down and trigger the worst external crisis in its history and an external default.",
    "The coupons which are paid into the central bank in cash, are deflationary and allows it to buy some dollars but not return the same amount to stop the exchange rate from falling.",
    "In the first half of 2025 year the agency also gave 770 million US dollars to the government, in two-way unsterilized transactions.",
    "There have been warnings that as private credit picks up, unless central bank rings active deflationary policy (selling down its bond stock), it will lose the ability to collect reserves faster and give to the government.",
    "Analysts have also urged the Treasury to buy its own dollars (central bank dollar purchases are inflationary at the first instance, Treasury purchases are neutral if it is from rupees raised from the market or taxes), to prevent a second default and raised dollars to repay maturing debt.",
    "The central bank is operating a scarce reserve regime by avoiding inflationary open market operations to reward over trading banks at the moment, though the IMF has given technical assistance to make government liquidity forecasts and operate an abundant reserve regime and a single policy rate has been gazetted.",
    "It is not clear when the IMF technical assistance will kick in and inflationary policy will resume.",
    "However concerns have been expressed over the rate cuts which are now enforced mostly with \u2018signalling\u2019 and some inflationary dollar rupee (buy-sell) swaps.",
    "Sri Lanka cut rates with inflationary policy after the end of a civil war including to boost growth (potential output) and high levels of inflation (flexible inflation targeting) and depreciated the currency instead of correcting rates (exchange rate as the first line of defence) triggering a series of currency crisis, heavy foreign borrowings as long as rating space permitted, and eventual sovereign default.",
    "Technical assistance to calculate potential output was also given by the IMF.",
    "Amid the stability provided by deflationary policy and stable exchange rates (which is a result of monetary policy), Sri Lanka is now growing above the \u2018potential output\u2019 believed to be around 3.0 percent and there is no social unrest.",
    "Though potential output is mentioned in the new controversial central bank law, and is also mentioned in monetary policy statements, the number has not been revealed to the public or parliament so far. (Colombo/Sept05/2025)"
