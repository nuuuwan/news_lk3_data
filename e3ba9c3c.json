  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) says it has formally lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in Sri Lanka against former Sports Minister MP Roshan Ranasinghe.",
    "The complaint has been filed over the alleged misuse of funds provided by SLC to the National Sports Fund for the development of various other sports in Sri Lanka, the SLC said in a statement.",
    "The SLC said the decision to file this complaint stems from the concern that MP Roshan Ranasinghe has \u201cnot appropriately disclosed the utilization of funds allocated by SLC for the intended purposes\u201d.",
    "This move comes in the wake of a discernible disparity between the information disclosed to the media by Mr. Ranasinghe and the response received by SLC under a Right to Information (RTI) application, outlining the specifics of the expenditures made, SLC further claimed.",
    "\u201cSLC wishes to emphasize the importance of maintaining the integrity of financial transactions and ensuring that funds are utilized for their designated purposes and the said formal complaint filed with the Bribery Commission underscores SLC\u2019s dedication to upholding the highest standards of governance and ethics within the realm of sports administration.\u201d",
    "SLC says it trusts that the Bribery Commission will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter to ascertain the facts and take appropriate action as necessary and that Sri Lanka Cricket will continue to collaborate with relevant authorities to ensure a fair and just resolution to this issue, as part of its ongoing commitment to the promotion and advancement of sports in Sri Lanka."
