  "original_body_lines": [
    "The National Movement for Social Justice (NMS) in a statement urged all political parties to uphold people\u2019s expectations.",
    "We believe that in three days, the new Parliament, made up of representatives elected by the people, will take on a greater responsibility than ever before in history.",
    "This is especially important given the irresponsible behaviour we have seen in Parliament in recent years. Both the incoming Government and the Opposition will have a huge responsibility. Their first task should be to strengthen democracy by helping the country recover from the financial crisis we are facing. Additionally, the new Parliament must reflect the political culture that the people expect, with both the ruling party and the Opposition playing their part.",
    "We are paying close attention to this matter because we have witnessed some troubling incidents during the election process in recent days. It is disappointing to see that the generally positive political climate maintained during the last Presidential Election is being marred by some candidates during this Parliamentary (General) Election campaign.",
    "Therefore, it is the duty of all political parties and candidates to establish a good political culture that meets the people\u2019s expectations\u2014not only in these final days before the election, but also after the election. For this reason, the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ), calls on all parties to uphold the responsibilities expected by the people and promote a healthy political culture."
