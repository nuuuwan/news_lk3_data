    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Sifaan Zavahir (left) and Henning Graner of Germany celebrate the adoption of the resolution by the International Democratic Education Conference (IDEC) in October 2023 in Nepal",
    "The 30th International Democratic Education Conference (IDEC) 2023 in Nepal has called on the United Nations\u2019 Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) to clarify that \u201ccompulsory education\u201d means a guarantee of universal access to education and does not mean forcing a child to attend school.",
    "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948 was the first international recognition of Education as a Right, and it expressed the importance of this Right in Article 26 as \u201celementary education shall be compulsory\u201d.",
    "While it has become common practice to translate and paraphrase this as \u2018compulsory school attendance for children\u2019, this is not in line with the original intent of the wording, says IDEC.",
    "The minutes of the meetings of the UDHR drafting committee chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt record extensive discussions about this word and clearly show that nobody on the drafting committee at any point intended the word \u2018compulsory\u2019 to be interpreted as coercion of the child.",
    "This is confirmed by General Comment No.11 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) \u201cThe element of compulsion serves to highlight the fact that neither parents, nor guardians, nor the State are entitled to treat as optional the decision as to whether the child should have access to primary education.\u201d",
    "The IDEC Resolution 2023 insists that the principle of the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 must be fully respected, rather than being compromised for political and administrative expediency. The Resolution was collaboratively drafted by international democratic education advocates led by Richard Fransham (Canada), Sifaan Zavahir (Sri Lanka), Henning Graner (Germany) and Je\u2019anna Clements (South Africa) with input from several other participants from around the world.",
    "It was adopted at the IDEC General Meeting on Thursday 19 October 2023 and was sent to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in commemoration of the anniversary of the United Nations\u2019 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is on 20 November 2023.",
    "No, it means that children should be supported to have a choice of schools, homeschool, or be able to explore their education in other ways that they and their families prefer.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0Are you changing the meaning of the word \u2018compulsory\u2019 for education?",
    "No, we are asking the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) to make it clear what this word has always meant, because in many places in the world there is confusion.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean my country cannot make laws that force \u2018compulsory attendance\u2019 at a school?",
    "Countries sometimes do make laws that violate human rights. In our opinion, \u2018Compulsory attendance\u2019 is not supported by the original intent of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and is not an expression of the child\u2019s right to education.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean parents can just keep their children at home or just send them to work?",
    "No. Parents must support their child to fulfill their right to education, whether this is at home, using a school, or in other ways that the child and family prefer.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0Where can the full text of the IDEC Resolution be downloaded?",
    "The full text of the IDEC Resolution could be viewed at https://www.idecnepal.org/PDFs/resolution-idec2023.pdf 2 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1 Universal Declaration of Human Rights"
