  "original_body_lines": [
    "Devoting the first  Saturday article in each month to a film, film personality or film-related topic is a practice  being followed by this column.  As such this  week\u2019s column focuses  on a  Sri Lankan actor who made a name for himself in radio plays, stage dramas and movies. The  actor known popularly as \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas was a household name in Tamil speaking homes of the island during the last quarter of the 20th century.",
    "Sathyavaageeswara Iyer Ramdas was a Hindu Brahmin. Yet he was widely known as \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas. This was because his most famous and popular role as an actor was that of a Muslim named Marikkar. Ramdas excellently  portrayed the Muslim character, speaking perfectly the dialect of Colombo Muslims.",
    "Ramdas first acted as Marikkar in a radio drama serial which was later made into a successful movie. He also performed as Marikkar in many skits and concerts. Due to the performance-related transformation of the Hindu Brahmin into a Muslim, Ramdas became known as \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas. The description \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas was in a sense an award bestowed upon the artiste by an appreciative public.",
    "\u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas  loved acting and took to the stage in school concerts at a very young age and then went on to act in radio plays as well. He also began writing scripts. Later on Ramdas acted in Tamil films and TV dramas. He wrote the screenplay and dialogues for some films and TV dramas too. Though comedy was his forte, Ramdas was also a very good character actor.",
    "I became slightly acquainted with Ramdas when I was working as a Journalist on the Tamil newspaper \u201cVirakesari\u201d. Those were the days when a few Tamil films were being produced in Sri Lanka by Sri Lankans. As a cinema aficionado and a  reporter of a Tamil newspaper I was excited about it and used to interact with artistes and filmmakers involved in such ventures.",
    "Ramdas, who worked for many years at Colonial Motors in Union Place, used to live in Polhengoda then. He rode a scooter and used to  give  me a few rides those days. We have enjoyed each other\u2019s company at gatherings hosted by members of the Sri Lankan film fraternity.",
    "I lost touch with Ramdas after I left Sri Lanka in 1988. Ramdas himself became less active as an actor in later years and relocated to India. He passed away in India on 13 July 2016. I wrote an article about him then. If he  were alive now Marikkar Ramdas would have celebrated his 76th birthday on 5 May 2023. It is against this backdrop that I write about him now  relying on my earlier writings.",
    "Ramdas was born on 5 May 1947 in Sivagangai, in the Tamil Nadu state of India.  Earlier it was a tiny principality ruled by a feudal chieftain. Currently Sivagangai is the capital of a newly created district also known as Sivagangai.",
    "Ramdas\u2019s parents Sathyavaageeswara Iyer and Nagalaxmi moved to Colombo from India before Ramdas was one year old. Ramdas was the eldest son in a family of five childen. The other four were all girls. The family lived in Wellawatte, Pamankade and Thimbirigasaya.",
    "Ramdas was an old boy of Isipathana College in Havelock Town. The college was founded in 1952 and known initially as Greenlands College. Ramdas belonged to the first batch of Kindergarten students enrolled at Greenlands College in 1952.",
    "The Principal then was B. A. Kuruppu, who encouraged student activities such as music, singing and drama. Ramdas began acting in classroom plays and school concerts. It was through school dramas that he first acted on stage. Ramdas completed his GCE (OL) at Isipathana but did not proceed further to do his \u201cA\u201d levels.",
    "Nagalaxmi Sathyavaageeswara was a vocalist in Carnatic music. So too were two of her daughters. They used to do programs at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) known then as \u2018Radio Ceylon\u2019. Ramdas used to escort his mother and sisters to Radio Ceylon and back regularly. It was then that he met Saravanamuttu, known as \u201cVaanoli Maamaa\u201d (Radio Uncle), who was in charge of the weekly children\u2019s program in Tamil, \u2018Siruvar Malar\u2019. Young Ramdas plucked up courage to ask Saravanamuttu for a chance to participate in the program. Vaanoli Maamaa auditioned Ramdas and selected him as an actor.",
    "Ramdas began acting in several dramas for children on radio. As he grew older Ramdas caught the ear of the famous broadcaster, actor and playwright and actor Shanmuganathan known as \u201cSaanaa\u201d. It was Shanmuganathan who gave Ramdas his first break as a professional actor in radio. Ramdas  later recalled  with pride that his first payment as an actor was the Rs. 45 paid by SLBC for Shanmuganathan\u2019s radio play.",
    "Saana also produced a humorous program called \u2018Mathaappoo\u2019 over radio. Ramdas became a regular in that program and began gaining popularity. It must be remembered that TV had not been introduced in Sri Lanka at that time and radio was the cherished medium then.",
    "The popular radio actor soon made his entry onto the Tamil stage in a big way. Ramdas began acting in a number of dramas that were staged in different parts of the country. Some of these plays were \u2018Kaadhal Jaakiradhai,\u2019 \u2018Vaadagai Veedu,\u2019 \u2018Broker Kanthiah,\u2019 \u2018Kalaattaa Kadhal,\u2019 \u2018Nadigargal\u2019 and \u2018Thideer Vedi\u2019.",
    "Ramdas also acted in \u2018Sumathi,\u2019 which won the first prize at the Tamil drama festival conducted by the \u2018Thinakaran\u2019 Tamil  newspaper published by Lake House. Ramdas won the Best Comedian Award. While acting on stage, Ramdas never forsook his first love radio. He continued to act over radio too.",
    "Production of original Tamil films began in Sri Lanka from 1962 onwards. The process  proceeded in fits and starts till the \u201970s of the last century. The setting up of a Film Corporation and the restrictions placed on the import and screening of Indian Hindi and Tamil language films provided a boost to the nascent Sri Lankan Tamil film industry. With more Tamil films being made in Sri Lanka, actors such as Ramdas began getting opportunities to act on screen.",
    "\u2018Kuthu Vilakku\u2019 was a film produced by the well-known architect V. S. Thurairajah. Ramdas made his film debut in that film. Thereafter he got chances in more films.",
    "V. P. Ganesan, the father of Colombo District MP and TPA leader Mano Ganesan, was a well-known trade unionist. He produced and acted as the hero in three Tamil films. They were \u2018Puthiya Kaatru,\u2019 \u2018Naan Ungal Thozhan\u2019 and \u2018Naadu Patra Vaazhga\u2019. Ganesan was a close friend of Ramdas and gave him comedian  roles in all three films.",
    "Other Tamil films in which Ramdas acted were \u2018Koamaligal,\u2019 \u2018Aemaaligal,\u2019 \u2018Maamiyaar Veedu\u2019 and \u2018Sharmilaavin Idhaya Ragam\u2019. He also acted in the Sinhala film \u2018Nomiyena Minisun\u2019 directed  by Gamini Fonseka  who also starred in it..",
    "The film \u2018Maamiyaar Veedu\u2019 (Mother-in-Law\u2019s House) was an Indo-Lanka joint production. Indian actors like the veteran S.V. Subbiah and actresses Jeya and Meera and several Sri Lankan actors starred in the film. Most of the shooting was done in Sri Lanka.",
    "Ramdas too acted as a comic villain in the film. It was an ambiguous role in which the character had to shift back and forth from villainy to comedy rapidly. Moreover, the script required much sparring with the great thespian Subbiah in several  scenes. S.V. Subbiah, a great character actor, was impressed by Ramdas and compared him to \u201cNadigaverl\u201d M.R. Radha, who excelled in such types of  villai-comedian roles in Tamil cinema.",
    "However  Ramdas\u2019s  magnum opus in movies was \u2018Koamaaligal,\u2019 in which he acted as \u201cMarikkar\u201d. The roots of the film was radio. The well-known artiste \u201cSillaiyoor\u201d Selvarajan was then in charge of producing a radio program sponsored by People\u2019s Bank. Selvarajan saw a 30-minute comedy staged by Ramdas in 1974 at D.S. Senanayake College in Colombo. He requested Ramdas to develop the play into a lengthy drama for broadcasting as a serial over radio. Ramdas happily agreed.",
    "Ramdas then wrote a lengthy radio play titled \u2018Koamaaligalin Kummaalam\u2019 (Hilarious Antics of Clowns/Jokers). The play was broadcast every Sunday at 4 p.m. over radio continuously for 90 weeks. Ramdas wrote the script and acted in the principal part. It was immensely popular. I too remember listening to it regularly in those days.",
    "Subsequently the play was produced as a film by businessman M. Mohammed under the banner of Amarjothy Movies. Ramdas was entrusted the duties of writing the screenplay and dialogues for the film in addition to acting as Marikkar. He also served as Assistant Director for the film.",
    "\u2018Koamaaligal\u2019 was a comedy with the message of national unity. It was about families belonging to different ethnicities and religions living in separate parts of a huge mansion. Ramdas once told me that the inspiration for Koamaaligal came from the Indian Tamil film \u2018Bharatha Vilaas\u2019 directed by A. C. Trilokchander. In that film starring Sivaji Ganesan and K.R. Vijaya, families from different Indian ethnic groups  lived  in a common house named Bharatha Vilaas. The film emphasised national unity under the aegis of Bharat or India.",
    "Ramdas however did not push the national theme blatantly  in his film. He presented it as a comedy full of laughs in which the problems among different people living under one roof were highlighted humorously. The overall message however was that despite differences people of one country had to learn to coexist peacefully. Ethnic amity and unity in diversity were the underlying themes though superficially it was a boisterously comic film. I am subject to correction but as far as I am aware no Sinhala film has been made on similar lines so far.",
    "The most remarkable feature of the film were the four major protagonists who belonged to the four major ethnicities of Sri Lanka. They were Upali \u2013 Sinhala, Appukkutti \u2013 Sri Lankan Tamil, Marikkar \u2013 Muslim and Iyer \u2013 Indian Tamil. The parts of Marikkar, Iyer, Upali and Appukkutti were played by S. Ramdas, B. H. Abdul Hameed, S. Selvasekaran and T. Rajagopal respectively. A most welcome pleasant irony was that of Ramdas, a Brahmin, acting as Marikkar the Muslim; and a Muslim, Abdul Hameed, acting as Iyer the Brahmin.",
    "Koamaaligal released on 22 October 1976 was well-received and a commercial success. It ran for 76 days at a stretch in Sellamahaal theatre and 55 days at the Plaza theatre in Colombo. (Both theatres are no more.) The film also ran successfully in different areas of the country such as Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kandy, Badulla and Bandarawela. It ran for 51 days when screened at the Ranee cinema in Jaffna.",
    "Encouraged and emboldened by the success of Koamaaligal, Ramdas ventured out to make a sequel. It was titled \u2018Aemaaligal,\u2019 meaning suckers or the deceived ones. The word \u2018Aemaaligal\u2019 rhymed with \u201cKoamaaligal\u201d when pronounced in Tamil. The businessman A. M. Mowjood stepped in and produced the film under the Bakeer Films banner.",
    "Ramdas wrote the screenplay, dialogues and also re-enacted his Marikkar role. In addition he functioned as Assistant Director and Executive Producer. Apart from \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas, \u201cUpali\u201d Selvasekaran and \u201cAppullutti\u201d Rajagopal also acted in the film. Only the radio announcer B. H. Abdul Hameed who acted earlier as Iyer was missing. Aemaaligal turned out to be a reasonable commercial success but was not quite up to Koamaaligal.",
    "Ramdas however was now firmly established as \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas. His body language as well as pronunciation was that of a Muslim hailing from Colombo. Moreover, the song \u2018Ennadi Sithi Beebee\u2019 written and sung by Ramdas was a terrific hit. It was modelled on the popular \u2018Ennadi Raakkammaa\u2019 sung by T. M. Soundararajan in the silver jubilee film \u2018Pattikkaada Pattanamaa\u2019. Ramdas had written and sung the words in parody form in the dialect of Colombo Muslims (different regions have different dialects).",
    "This then is the story of S. Ramdas the Brahmin who excelled as an actor portraying a Muslim and was rewarded for his efforts by acquiring the name \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas. The artiste passed away at the age of 69  on 13 July 2016 at Besant Nagar in Chennai(Tamil Nadu) where his daughter Priya was  residing.",
    "Sadness spread among numerous fans of Sri Lankan origin scattered widely in different parts of the globe as news of the demise of the popular artiste reached them.  Though inactive as an artiste for many years , he  was not forgotten by the public which he entertained once. One could recognise genuine grief and a heartfelt sense of loss as people came to know that the man known to them as \u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas had passed away.\u201cMarikkar\u201d Ramdas will always be remembered by his numerous fans in Sri Lanka and all over the world.",
