    "\u201cUnfortunately yesterday was not our day. I would like to thank all Indians for supporting our team and me throughout the tournament. Thankful to PM Narendra Modi for specially coming to the dressing room and raising our spirits. We will bounce back!\u201d wrote Shami, who nabbed 24 wickets from just seven outings and also became India\u2019s top wicket taker in ODI World Cup history during the process.",
    "\u201cWe had a great tournament but we ended up short yesterday. We are all heartbroken but the support of our people is keeping us going. PM Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the dressing room yesterday was special and very motivating,\u201d shared Jadeja.",
