    "Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka is not yet aware of the nature of hazardous materials in the Singapore cargo ship Dali chartered by Maersk, which crashed into the Baltimore, US bridge on March 26, carrying 764 tons of hazardous materials as reported by the US media, an official said.",
    "According to information available, there are 57 containers with such toxic materials that can be categorized under the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code.",
    "The waste included mostly corrosives, flammables, miscellaneous hazardous materials, and Class-9 hazardous materials, including explosives & lithium-ion batteries \u2013 in 56 containers. So says the US National Transportation Safety Board, still \u2018analyzing the ship\u2019s manifest to determine what was onboard\u2019 in its other 4,644 containers.",
    "Prior to Baltimore, the Dali called at New York and Norfolk, Virginia, which has the world\u2019s largest naval base. Colombo was to be its next scheduled call, going around South Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope, taking 27 days, scheduled to land just after our New Year. The US National Transportation Safety Board has reported that the ship had been carrying 764 tons of hazardous materials including explosives to SL in 56 containers.",
    "Asked for a comment in this regard, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Chairman Keith Bernard said the ship should declare the contents of containers only 72 hours before the time of arrival into the Colombo Port.",
    "\u201cThe ship is supposed to arrive here on April 21, 2024. It means they are supposed to inform us by April 17 or so. There is enough time. If there are containers with hazardous items as declared by them, we will isolate such containers in accordance with protocols. As a major transshipment hub, we have a procedure set in place to deal with such containers. Most likely, these containers are meant for transshipment,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked about the procedure if the containers are meant to be allowed into the country, he said the clearance of the Defence Ministry and others would be sought.",
    "However, Deputy Director of the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Ajith Wijesundara said it is not yet clear whether the ship was carrying containers with hazardous wastes or toxic substances. According to the Basel Convention, he said such wastes would not be allowed into the country.",
    "The text of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on March 22, 1989 and entered into force on the ninetieth day after the date of deposit of the twentieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, formal confirmation, approval or accession, on May 5, 1992. The text has been subject to various amendments since its adoption.",
    "He added that toxic substances are imported as raw materials and guidelines are applied."
