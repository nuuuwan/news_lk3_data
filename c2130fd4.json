    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is in discussion with firms from India and Pakistan to import cement cheaper than the current market prices after a meeting with key construction industry stakeholders,\u00a0Urban Development and Housing Minister\u00a0 Prasanna Ranatunga said.",
    "Price of a 50 kg cement dropped by 150 rupees or 5.4 percent last month despite a 20 percent appreciation in the rupee currency in the last two months. However, Minister Ranatunga says the local prices could be further reduced.",
    "\u201cWe are in discussion through BMC (Building Materials Corporation) with India and Pakistan to bring cement for 300-400 rupee less than the current price, Ranatunga told a media briefing on Friday (23) at the Presidential Media Center (PMC).",
    "The price escalation has hit the construction industry and Ranatunga said around 100,000 construction workers are directly hit by the move.",
    "The construction sector fell 21 percent last year and declined 19.8 percent in the first quarter this year. Most constructors have stopped their constructions after the borrowing cost sharply rose and construction material cost became expensive.",
    "\u201cThere should be some regulations with regard to today\u2019s prices. When we had a meeting with condominium stakeholders, they told us we could reduce the prices (of cement) if we buy from certain firms. So now we have started discussion to look into bringing it down at a lower price,\u201d Ranatunga said.",
    "\u201cAccording to the information I get we can bring cement prices down by 400-500 rupees. When we bring, we will only give to those who are working with us (under Urban Development Authority) including those who are working on condominiums.\u201d (Colombo/June 23/2023)"
