  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Court of Appeal has decided to defer further consideration of the case filed against the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee until December 13.",
    "When the case was called before the Appeals Court this morning, the attorney-at-law representing the new Sports Minister Harin Fernando sought more time for his client to deliberate on the matter and convey his stance to the bench.",
    "Accordingly, the case was fixed for December 13 for further consideration.",
    "Further, Sports Minister Fernando gave an undertaking before the Appeals Court, pledging that no further action would be taken in respect of the gazette notification issued by his predecessor Roshan Ranasinghe.",
    "On Nov.06, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by the then-Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe. It was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga and consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen.",
    "The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging Ranasinghe\u2019s move.",
    "Later, on Nov.13, Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order.",
    "Nevertheless, on Nov.27, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation.",
    "Harin Fernando, who was serving as the Minister of Tourism, was thus sworn in as the new Minister of Sports to replace Ranasinghe."
