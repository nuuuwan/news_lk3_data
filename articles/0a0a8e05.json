    "Making submissions before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Peiris said it was a wrongful and arbitrary act to propose the name of Deshabandu Thennakoon to the Constitutional Council, citing multiple charges against him and court findings of guilt in cases of torture. Peiris further argued that appointing Thennakoon as the IGP without proper approval from the Constitutional Council was unconstitutional as well.",
