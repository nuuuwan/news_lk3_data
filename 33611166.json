    "ECONOMYNEXT  \u2013 Sri Lanka has posted a current account surplus of 639 million US dollars in the third quarter of 2023, central bank data showed, maintaining a trend seen since the fourth quarter of 2022, after monetary stability was restored.",
    "Sri Lanka has repaid multilateral debt, the central bank has collected reserves and also settled some dollars borrowed through swaps in 2023, while private banks also built-up dollar balances or repaid credit lines.",
    "In the second quarter the current account surplus was calculated at 49 million US dollars and in the first quarter of 2023, as 543 million US dollars, according to central bank data.",
    "A country with a reserve collecting central bank which prints money to suppress rates loses the ability to make external payments as forex shortages emerge with the newly minted money being spent.",
    "As a result, a country can barely make current payments, let alone making capital payments.",
    "Sri Lanka and other countries with bad-money central banks with high inflation targets of 5 percent or higher, yearn after current account surpluses, as domestic capital is destroyed through depreciation forcing the country to borrow abroad for investments.",
    "A central bank that maintains monetary stability however allows the country to make external payments, which reduces domestic spending or investments triggering a current account surplus.",
    "That a trade surplus (now current) was needed to make external payments and not the other way around was one of the spurious monetary ideologies that emerged in the 1920s.",
    "The ideas called the \u2018transfer problem\u2019 was promoted in particular by J M Keynes in relation to Weimar Germany which was printing money was unable to make reparations payments but was borrowing externally and running trade deficits.",
    "Other economists including Bertil Ohlin, Jacques Reuff and Ludwig von Mises disputed the claim, saying the problem was inflation (injection of money).",
    "\u201cThe truth is that the maintenance of monetary stability and of a sound currency system has nothing whatever to do with the balance of payments or of trade,\u201d explained Mises.",
    "\u201cThere is only one thing that endangers monetary stability\u2014inflation. If a country neither issues additional quantities of paper money nor expands credit, it will not have any monetary troubles.",
    "\u201cAn excess of exports is not a prerequisite for the payment of reparations. The causation, rather, is the other way round. The fact that a nation makes such payments has the tendency to create such an excess of exports. There is no such thing as a \u201ctransfer\u201d problem.\u201d",
    "Ohlin in vain tried to explain the link between central bank inflationism, external borrowings and their effects on imports and the trade balance.",
    "\u201cIn a country, which neither borrows from nor lends to other countries and which maintains equilibrium on its capital market, \u201cbuying power\u201d is identical with \u201caggregate of money earnings,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cForeign borrowing, however, increases and loans (to foreigners) reduce buying power. Similarly, inflationary credit policy (central bank open market operations to inject money) increases and deflationary policy (CB-held securities sales) reduces it.",
    "\u201cIn the former case new buying power is created by the banks; in the latter, money which is earned and save is not lent by the banks to others, \u2013 it vanishes (is sterilized) and buying power falls off.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the former case new buying power is created by the banks (when the injected money is loaned to customers); in the latter, money is which is earned and saved is not lent by the banks to others, \u2013 it vanishes and buying power falls off.\u201d",
    "Related Sri Lanka debt crisis trapped in spurious Keynesian \u2018transfer problem\u2019 and MMT: Bellwether",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has appreciated the currency from 360 to 330 after Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe allowed market rates to go up from April 2022 and removed a surrender rule in March 2023.",
    "Since then the central bank has maintained the rupee has been maintained around 322 to 330 to the US dollar. Maintaining a stable or fixed exchange rate is the most easiest monetary regime imaginable as long as laws can be brought to restrain liquidity injections.",
    "Reserve collecting monetary authorities that do not try to aggressively suppress rates end up with low interest rates near developed nations, free trade and free flow of capital. (Colombo/Jan04/2023)"
