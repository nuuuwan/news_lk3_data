By September 2024, the net foreign assets of the central bank were negative by only 175 million dollars from a peak of negative 4.6 billion US dollars at the height of the last currency crisis in August 2024, which ended in external sovereign default.

The central bank‚Äôs foreign reserves were a negative 4.0 billion dollars in March 2022 when the central bank hiked rates to contain domestic credit.
