Responding to a question by SJB MP Hesha Vithanage, the Minister said Air India was sold out to Tata due to losses and added that Emirates was provided some USD 2 to 3 billion by the government every year.

He said a small country like Sri Lanka is not in a position to maintain an airline in that manner.

### Australia raises minimum savings for student visa, warns on fake recruitment

SYDNEY, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

The SLPP believes in adhering to the constitution, which schedules the next parliamentary election for 2025, but acknowledges the president's power to dissolve parliament and call an election earlier. Rajapaksa advises MPs to prepare for any election, while SLPP MPs in government are expected to prioritize the presidential election.
