    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, addressing the UN General Assembly on Thursday, called for a concerted global effort to eliminate the evil of corruption. He rightly described corruption as a destructive force that undermined development, democracy and social wellbeing while perpetuating poverty. He noted that Sri Lanka had already embarked on a difficult but essential campaign to eliminate corruption for the sake of future generations and urged all countries to do so. He flaunted his government\u2019s anti-corruption drive as a success story. Whether other nations will heed his call and join forces to launch a global-scale war on corruption remains to be seen. However, one cannot but agree with President Dissanayake on the need to do everything possible to rid Sri Lanka of the twin evils of bribery and corruption to achieve economic recovery and national progress.",
    "Close on the heels of President Dissanayake\u2019s clarion call, in New York, for battling corruption with might and main to make the world a better place, Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Neil Iddewela, in Colombo, shed light on public perception of state sector corruption in this country. Speaking at a seminar\u2013\u2013\u201cIntegrity, Transparency, and Good Governance for National Development\u201d\u2013\u2013jointly organised by the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association and the Sri Lanka Institute of Administrative Professionals, Iddawela made public some findings of a countrywide survey his institution had conducted to ascertain public perception of corruption, as part of its national anti-corruption action plan.",
    "He said the police were considered the most corruption-prone state institution, followed by the political class, the Customs, Ministries, the Department of Immigration and Emigration, the Land Registry, the Provincial Councils, the Foreign Employment Bureau, Divisional Secretariats, Department of Registrar General and the judiciary. However, he added that going by public complaints and investigations, the CIABOC had found that corruption in five state institutions had a far worse impact on the national economy than others. They are the Customs, the Inland Revenue Department and provincial revenue offices, The Excise Department, the Department of Immigration and Emigration, and the Department of Motor Vehicles. He revealed that some regulatory bodies such as the National Gem and Jewellery Authority and the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) facilitated financial misconduct and money laundering. The GSMB has allegedly enabled foreign companies to obtain exploration licences fraudulently at the expense of the national interest. We suggest that a special presidential commission of inquiry be appointed to probe the GSMB, which has become a metaphor for corruption.",
    "Meanwhile, staggering losses that the country suffers due to politicians\u2019 corrupt practices are believed to be incalculable, for they have taken a heavy toll on foreign investment and led to massive cost overruns in development projects. There have also been instances where some foreign-funded projects came to a halt allegedly due to politicians\u2019 demand for bribes. These allegations have gone uninvestigated. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to five years in jail for a criminal conspiracy to raise campaign funds from Libya in 2007. That some Sri Lankan politicians and political parties receive funds from foreign sources is public knowledge. There is said to be no such thing as a free lunch, and campaign funds come with strings attached. But no Sri Lankan politician has been prosecuted for undisclosed campaign financing.",
    "Meanwhile, the JVP leaders ought to practise what they preach and lead by example. Their asset declarations have created quite a stir as they claimed to be dependent on their party for financial support. The fact that they have acquired assets while living off others has given rise to a moral issue. Shouldn\u2019t they have used their private funds to look after their families without being a burden on their party, its members and others? There is another issue as well. Citizens must account for their assets and pay taxes thereon.",
    "So, the JVP bigwigs ought to heed their political rivals\u2019 demand that they reveal whether they have paid income tax on their assets. They also have a right to ask the Opposition politicians to account for the latter\u2019s assets and demand to know whether income tax has been paid thereon.",
