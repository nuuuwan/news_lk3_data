  "original_body_lines": [
    "Stresses SL could bring in revenue and even foreign exchange through development of fisheries industry",
    "Claims Govt. has allocated a mere Rs. 5 per fisherman while allocating Rs. 110 million for maintenance of Ex-Presidents",
    "Says fault lies not with Minister but with Govt\u2019s flawed policies",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath criticised the Government yesterday expressing dissatisfaction with the allocation of a mere Rs. 5 per fisherman in the 2024 Budget.",
    "Speaking in Parliament, the MP highlighted that Sri Lanka possesses a bountiful ocean area of 517,000 km\u00b2, suggesting that the country has the potential to generate substantial revenue through fisheries. \u201cIt could even bring in significant foreign exchange,\u201d he noted.",
    "However, the MP expressed regret that the fisheries industry is deteriorating continuously. \u201cAn industry that once contributed 2.5% to the GDP has now fallen to 1%. The cause, Herath alleged, is the incorrect policies of the current Government.",
    "\u201cEven this Budget will adversely affect their livelihoods. To foster industry development, essential support and incentives must be provided. However, with the current Budget allocation divided among the number of fishers in the country, it is clear that only Rs. 5 has been allocated per fisherman,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable to observe that, at the same time, the Government has allocated a substantial Rs. 110 million for the upkeep of former Presidents who have been accused of contributing to the country\u2019s bankruptcy, as confirmed by a court decision,\u201d Herath added.",
    "The MP deemed this unjust and raised concerns about how the industry can be revived under these circumstances. \u201cNot even a rupee has been allocated for 2024 to develop fisheries-related infrastructure,\u201d he noted. Herath emphasised that the failure is not attributed to the subject Minister but is instead a consequence of the Government\u2019s flawed policies."
