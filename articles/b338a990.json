    "Sampath Bank registered a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs 18.5 Bn and a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 11.1 Bn for 1H 2024 reflecting growth rates of 40% and 45% respectively compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The Sampath Group also reported PBT and PAT figures of Rs 19.7 Bn and Rs 11.9 Bn respectively, reflecting growth rates of 47% and 55%.",
    "Decrease in net fee and commission income by10.9% due to a decline in income from trade- related operations.",
    "Anex change loss of Rs.2.7Bn due to the appreciation of the LKR against the USD by Rs.17.85.",
    "Strong growth in the LKR deposit portfolio, amounting to Rs.115Bn.",
    "Tier 1 and Total Capital Adequacy Ratios at 16.98% and 19.96% respectively, comfortably exceeding regulatory minimum requirements.",
    "During the first half of 2024, the Bank reported a total interest income of Rs 95 Bn, a 5.7% decline from the same period of the previous year, primarily attributable to a decreasing AWPLR. The continuous decline in market interest rates resulted in the interest expense for the period decreasing from Rs 67 Bn in 1H 2023 to Rs 54 Bn in 1H 2024. This substantial decrease in interest expense, outpacing the decline in interest income, resulted in a notable 20.3% increase in Net Interest Income (NII), reaching Rs 41 Bn for 1H 2024.",
    "The Bank\u2019s strategic management of assets and liabilities significantly contributed to the impressive growth in Net Interest Income (NII), particularly in the context of declining interest rates. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) experienced a slight increase, rising from 5.16% as of 31st December 2023, to 5.18% as of the reporting date.",
    "In 1H 2024, the Bank\u2019s Net fee and commission income amounted to Rs 8.7 Bn, reflecting a 11% decline compared to the previous period, primarily due to reduced income from trade-related activities. The decrease in trade-related income is mainly attributed to reduced commission rates on import transactions and the impact of LKR appreciation. However, fees generated from other channels, including credit, electronic, cards and remittance-related activities, showed growth compared to the same period of the previous year.",
