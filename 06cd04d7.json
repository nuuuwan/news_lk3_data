    "Govt. not in a position to reconstruct narrow bridges such as Kotaleeya: Minister",
    "Reckless driving of buses continues to claim the\u00a0 lives of innocent passengers and such recklessness had led to the\u00a0 tragedy of the loss of lives of at least 13 persons in accidents in\u00a0 Manampitiya and Ambanpola areas within a few hours,investigations revealed.",
    "At least 11 passengers lost their lives on Sunday\u00a0 evening and caused injuries to more than 40 persons after a bus from\u00a0 Polonnaruwa to Kaththankudi collided on the Kotaleeya Bridge at\u00a0 Manampitiya and toppled into the river.",
    "Police fear that the death toll in the tragedy could claim\u00a0 more lives because some of the passengers undergoing treatment at the hospital are in critical condition and search operations are underway in\u00a0 the Kotaleeya Lake of the Mahaweli River to find if there were more\u00a0 bodies of passengers lying in the river.",
    "Police said the driver of the bus involved in the accident\u00a0 had been arrested by the Polonnaruwa Police, and initial investigations\u00a0 revealed that the driver had been penalized for reckless driving on a\u00a0 previous occasion.",
    "Although there was no indication that the driver was drunk,\u00a0 Police are awaiting a toxicology report to determine if the driver had\u00a0 consumed dangerous drugs, Police Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa said.",
    "\u201cInitial investigations revealed that the accident took\u00a0 place not due to a technical fault in the bus. If the investigations\u00a0 rule that the accident took place due to the recklessness of the driver,\u00a0 police will file a case under the criminal law,\u201d he said.",
    "Police are yet to ascertain how many passengers were travelling on the bus at the time of the accident.",
    "\u201cThe Kotaleeya Bridge is a narrow bridge and two buses\u00a0 cannot cross the bridge at the same time. The driver of the bus involved\u00a0 in the accident has knowledge about the danger in the bridge as he\u00a0 usually travels on the route,\u201d the spokesman said.",
    "The spokesman said however police are still investigating\u00a0 to determine the cause of the accident and statements will also be\u00a0 recorded from the injured passengers after they recover.",
    "Meanwhile, it is reported that the passenger bus involved\u00a0 in the accident does not have a permit from the National Transport\u00a0 Commission.",
    "Speaking to the media, the Chairman of the National\u00a0 Transport Commission Shashi Welgama, said that investigations are\u00a0 currently being carried out to see if any license has been granted by a\u00a0 provincial authority.",
    "Meanwhile, another bus accident was reported yesterday morning\u00a0 in the Ambanpola Police area, injuring 29 passengers and resulting in\u00a0 two deaths.",
    "The bus was carrying pilgrims and travelling from Padeniya\u00a0 to Anuradhapura. The bus crashed into a container truck parked on the\u00a0 side of the road. Two people, aged 32 and 71, residents of the Thalawa\u00a0 area, died, and 29 were injured.",
    "SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that according to the investigations, the accident took place as the driver fell asleep at the wheel.",
    "He said driving a vehicle and falling asleep is reckless driving and the drivers could avert such tragedy.",
    "Meanwhile, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that\u00a0 the Kotaleeya Bridge is a narrow bridge and the Road Development\u00a0 Authority had submitted a proposal to reconstruct the bridge five years\u00a0 ago with an estimated cost of Rs. 300 million.",
    "\u201cHowever, under the current debt restructuring process, the\u00a0 government is not in a position to spend such an amount for the construction of a bridge. Not only this particular bridge involved in the\u00a0 accident but there are more similar narrow bridges across the country\u00a0 that need to be reconstructed,\u201d the minister said at the cabinet\u00a0 briefing yesterday."
