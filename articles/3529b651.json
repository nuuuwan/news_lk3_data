    "\"Those who died in churches on April 21, 2019\u00a0 sacrificed their lives for what they believed. They came to church on that day because they believed in Christ. They sacrificed their lives because they loved Christ like other saints,\" he said.",
    "\"A person can be named a saint only after the completion of five years since his\u00a0 sacrifice. Therefore, we will move towards declaring Easter Sunday victims as saints on April 21 this year,\" he added.",
