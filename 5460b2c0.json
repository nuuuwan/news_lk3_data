I fail to comprehend the necessity of acquiring an additional $30 billion for the remaining six months of this year,\u201d Marikkar said.",
    "The MP said while the Appropriation Draft Bill indicated the Government's expenditure as Rs. 4222 billion, however, it is now attempting to escalate it to Rs. 13 222 billion through the acquisition of these loans. \u201cThey are trying to increase expenditure by 322%,\u201d he alleged.",
    "Marikkar said that the opposition is unaware of the intended purpose behind the Government's increase in expenditure.",
    "\u201cWe are left in the dark regarding the purpose of this expenditure. Is it for infrastructure, social welfare, or education? It is puzzling that the government is attempting to increase expenditure while refusing to release the allocated funds for the local government polls, claiming a lack of financial resources. They are seeking to raise expenditure by Rs. 9,000 billion, but they couldn't find Rs. 10 billion for the elections,\u201dhe emphasised.",
    "\u201cDespite the parliament having fiscal powers, the Government keeps its plans hidden from us. They seem determined to undermine the country. Reckless economic measures, loans and money printing and the eventual inability to service debts led to this crisis. Throughout this process, the opposition is kept completely in the dark, unaware of their actions,\u201d he alleged."
