More than 1,300 faithful died during the Hajj pilgrimage, which took place amid intense heat, and most of the deceased did not have official permits, Saudi Arabia said on Sunday.

“Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83% being unauthorized to perform Hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

Based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries’ responses, an AFP tally last week put the toll at more than 1,100.

The dead came from more than 10 countries stretching from the United States to Indonesia, and some governments are continuing to update their totals.

Arab diplomats said last week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths — 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.

The diplomats said the cause of death in most cases was heat-related.

### World first epilepsy device fitted in UK boy’s skull

A boy with severe epilepsy has become the first patient in the world to trial a new device fitted in their skull to control seizures.

The neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals deep into his brain, has reduced Oran Knowlson’s daytime seizures by 80%.

His mother, Justine, told the BBC he was happier and had a “much better quality of life”.

The surgery was carried out in October as part of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London when Oran - who is now 13 - was 12.

Oran, from Somerset, has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy which he developed at the age of three.

Since then he has suffered several daily seizures ranging from two dozen to hundreds.

When we first spoke to Oran’s mum last autumn, prior to surgery, she explained how Oran’s epilepsy dominated his life: "It has robbed him of all of his childhood."

She told us Oran had a range of different seizures, including those where he fell to the ground, shook violently, and lost consciousness.

### The Economic Transformation Bill: For Whom & For What ?

Finance Minister Semasinghe)  of how to prevent future economic collapse and not based on any IMF prescriptions.

### Central bank swaps symptomatic of Sri Lanka’s IMF return tickets and default

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has been playing with swaps for some time and the agency’s 778 billion rupee forex loss in 2022 was directly related to swaps and other borrowings, which allows it to maintain an artificial policy rate.

Central bank swaps along with other doctrines like portfolio balance channels, are the foundation of modern age-of-inflation forex crises, default, outmigration and sudden soaring poverty.

As part of steps to prevent the next sovereign default by macro-economic policy, outlawing forex swaps will be a key measure that legislators can take.

The Nick Leeson style losses came not only from swaps but also IMF borrowings taken during an earlier flexible inflation targeting crisis and borrowings from India through the Asian Clearing Union, which have since been converted to a term facility.

With the large number of companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) across multiple sectors which are operating on different business models, deciding where to invest one’s money can be overwhelming.Most ‘growth investors’ determine a stock’s potential over the long run; nevertheless they want to catch the stock on an upswing instead of hoping for one in the future.

In this context, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) by Maharaja Foods Ltd which will open on 4th July 2024 may be in alignment with the strategy of many first time investors as well as portfolio investors. It could be an opportunity for them to pursue growth by taking a path of less volatility and more predictability because it involves a food manufacturing business that is least affected by inflation.

This decision was made in response to the case Arumugam and Others vs. the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry has applauded the United Kingdom’s decision to uphold the proscription of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist organisation.

In a statement posted on the social media platform X, Sabry highlighted the LTTE’s international network’s strategy to influence foreign governments into lifting the ban. “The LTTE’s international network’s approach and strategy is to get foreign Governments to de-proscribe the LTTE so that they could revive the LTTE,” Sabry wrote.

The UK Proscribed Organisations Appeals Commission, an independent court headed by a high court judge and supported by two retired senior diplomats, ruled against the de-proscription of the LTTE. The decision was made on 21 June confirming that the UK will continue to maintain the LTTE on its list of banned organisations.
