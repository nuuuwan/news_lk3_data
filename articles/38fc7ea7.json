    "During a recent visit to the pearl of the Indian Ocean, I was keen for my grandsons to visit my old school by the Beira. They had heard so much from me about the college chapel with its soaring dome shaped ceiling with the solar monstrance at the top, which they dismissed as a figment of seeya\u2019s imagination.",
    "Many facts and figures such as architect Booth, of Booth, Edward, and Reid, claiming it was the most beautiful chapel in Ceylon, or that it was modelled on the arch-basilica of St John Lateran in Rome, did not cut any ice with them. I had fond memories of 1,500 boys raising the roof with their lusty rendition of \u201cWe stand for God\u201d, and I insisted on a visit.",
    "I left it to my daughter to do some fast talking to get past the security personnel at the gate, while I embarked on a walking tour of my old haunts around the streets, then named after long forgotten colonials, like Darley Road and Forbes Lane. Back then there were plenty of little eating houses, where the pocket money of 25 cents stretched much more than at the school tuck shop. One could get a bunis and tea for that price.",
    "One such place was a seedy little tea boutique with the imposing owner, Santiago, who was present morning, noon, and possibly night. He was behind the counter making endless cups of tea which were frothed by expertly transferring from one cup to another. The buns and other goodies were in an open glass cabinet in front of him. No one dared to take more than what was paid for, under his watchful gaze.",
    "Only the flies had a free feed. A bunch of bananas hung from the roof, and for an extra five cents, an overripe banana could be picked. We rarely had any excess cash. It was saved up to buy comics, (strip cartoon books), sold in little booths outside the Maradana railway station. Cowboy comics like Roy Rogers and Lone Ranger were my favorites. McCallum road bookshops came later.",
    "Santiago at the eatery was an imposing figure with\u201d Do or Die\u201d in big letters tattooed on his bare chest. In our imagination we thought it meant, do pay up or face the consequences. As result no one dared to run away without paying. There was a bench along the wall and a small wooden table. It was an era before plastic chairs invaded the world. There was a brightly colored picture, from an old calendar on the wall. The radio was on all the time playing songs from Hindi movies. Most ate standing up. This was a brilliant strategy to ensure fast turnover. When a customer complained of not having a place to sit, Santiago barked, \u201cBe like a man and do it standing up\u201d. In the vernacular, this had an effect which is lost in translation.",
    "A curtain of some sorts separated a back room that we dared not enter Occasionally, a man would go through with a nod from Santiago. We later found that this inner sanctum was used for gambling, illicit liquor, and who knows what. On looking back Santiago was ahead of his time and in modern parlance would be classed as an entrepreneur and would be running a casino. I later discovered another enterprising Santiago, who was a waiter and made his way to London in the 1880\u2019s. He wrote a cookbook of curries. This book is now a collector\u2019s item among book lovers, and collectors of kitchenalia.",
    "I went looking for Santiago\u2019s place, with not much hope of finding it among the three- and four-story buildings that now line the streets. Oh, what luck: it was there in the same place now tarted up and called a caf\u00e9. The picture on the wall was now replaced by a modernistic monochromatic print with some meaningless drivel written on it, in the style of an artist of Belgian origin. There were tables with flowery plastic table covers. The chairs were imitation Thonet bentwood chairs.",
    "The man at the counter was not as imposing as Santiago but was his son. He was happy that I remembered his father. In the spirit of truly Sri Lankan hospitality, he offered me a seeni bunis. I ordered a cup of tea for old times\u2019 sake. The cup of tea came with a dead fly in it. After much thought I brought it to the man\u2019s attention. His prompt response was \u201cSir, for the price paid, did you expect a chicken \u201c, The spirit of Santiago was well and truly alive. I slunk away with my tail between my legs, to write this tale for my grandsons.",
