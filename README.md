### How important was India’s help to Sri Lanka in 2022?

*2024-10-18 23:42:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-important-was-India-s-help-to-Sri-Lanka-in-2022/4-768162) · `en`

India’s help was significant at a crucial time as Sri Lanka was going through a nightmarish

The IMF program is to give Sri Lanka $ 3 billion over four years with conditions. India gave $ 4 billion in one year to Sri Lanka with no conditions. Also, the timing is important to note. The IMF program came in 2023 when Sri Lanka had stabilised to a large extent under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also, most of the toughest policies that were needed for Sri Lanka to achieve macroeconomic stability were already put in place by the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe when the IMF program was approved. But India came to Sri Lanka’s aid when Sri Lanka was staring at the abyss with a Government that was behaving very irrationally in January 2022 with the country facing macroeconomic instability. This point should not be forgotten by the Sri Lankan public

### Towards a climate-smart tourism sector: Building resilience through financial instruments

*2024-10-18 23:33:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Towards-a-climate-smart-tourism-sector-Building-resilience-through-financial-instruments/4-768154) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector holds great economic and social importance, but it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change

The tourism sector is an important pillar of Sri Lanka’s economy, providing income and employment for more than 400,000 people directly and indirectly across areas such as hospitality, transportation, and retail. However, like many other sectors, it is facing serious challenges and risks connected to climate change, necessitating a transformation towards sustainability and resilience.

Innovative financial instruments and risk transfer solutions could play an important part in enhancing the sector’s capacity to withstand climate-related shocks, recover from losses and damages, and adapt to long-term climatic changes. If Sri Lanka can pioneer new business models and creative risk management tools, it could help communities, entrepreneurs, tourism companies, and other stakeholders to turn the country into a more vibrant, resilient, and prosperous destination.

### In appreciation of Professor Kumar David

Professor Kumar David, once an academic in the Engineering Faculty, Peradeniya University, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in the UK and Hong Kong has left for eternal rest, last Monday while in Los Angeles, USA. We believe the “left” leaning English reader would miss Kumar’s forays into political controversies, with his own reading of issues that often provided dissenting, but populist perspectives, he developed over the decades since leaving the NSSP in 1980 July. Politically, he was advocating for “unity in the scattered left”.

Professionally too, he stood out as an exceptional, pragmatic thinker and was accepted for that. We believe he still remains the youngest to be appointed to the Director Board of the CEB way back in 1970, perhaps after the change of government in July. Kumar would not have been 30 years then. He was also a strong critic of the Mahaweli Development power generation scheme in 1979, when the blueprint was out for academic observation.

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah meanwhile vowed to escalate fighting against Israel and its backer Iran said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict.

Netanyahu called Sinwar’s killing a milestone late on Thursday but vowed to keep up the war, which in recent weeks expanded from fighting against Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza into an invasion of southern Lebanon and the bombardment of large swathes of the country.

Sri Lanka has chosen not to be a signatory for a letter signed by 105 countries, including European and African countries, as well as much of the Global South that “condemned” Israel for banning United Nations Secretary General (UNSG) entering into the country.

The move comes amid continuous UN pressure for a ceasefire in the conflict-hit Middle East.

Sri Lanka has been with the Global South on a number of resolutions that are critical of Israel and backing Palestine, but has decided not to sign the letter circulated by Chile, and supported by Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Uganda, Indonesia, Spain, Guyana and Mexico.

### Russia tests readiness of nuclear missile unit

*2024-10-18 16:45:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102783/russia-tests-readiness-of-nuclear-missile-unit) · `en`

Russia is testing the combat readiness of a unit equipped with Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles in a region northwest of Moscow, news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying on Friday.

The Yars, which can be deployed in silos or mounted on mobile launchers, has a range of up to 11,000 km (6,835 miles) and is capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads.

Russia has carried out a series of nuclear drills this year in what security analysts say are signals intended to deter the West from intervening more deeply in the war in Ukraine.

The latest one is taking place in the same week that NATO conducted its annual nuclear exercise and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy unveiled his “victory plan“.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that Moscow had extended the list of scenarios that could prompt it to use nuclear weapons, effectively lowering the threshold for their use. Ukraine accused Moscow of nuclear blackmail.

### Even though Yahya Sinwar is killed, our war against Israel will continue - the Palestinian people

*2024-10-18 15:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/196595) · `ta`

Palestinians vow continued resistance against Israel after Yahya Sinwar's death, citing broader conflict spanning over a century.

🟩

The Palestinian people have pledged that the war against Israel will continue, despite the killing of Yahya Sinwar.

The Palestinians in Khan Unis, who have been destroyed by the destruction war, are sure to continue the war, but the BBC reports that the war will continue.

The BBC has obtained the opinion of the Palestinians using independent journalists (it is noteworthy that Israel does not allow the BBC into Palestine.)

Dr. Ramadan Paris said the Palestinian people did not carry out this war with confidence in any leader or officer.

He said that this is much greater than Yahya Sinwar, the destruction war and the issue against the Palestinian people.

Israel is not just destroying us, he wants to destroy the entire Middle East.

He said the war between us and the Jews has been going on since 1919 for over 100 years.

I do not think that Sinwar's death will affect Hamas.

### CEB clarified about fueling thermal power plants

*2024-10-18 15:32:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202314) · `si`

Here's a 200-character summary:



CEB clarifies fuel supply for thermal power plants. Uses HFO (5.8%), naphtha (1.9%), diesel (1.1%) for electricity generation. Diesel purchase via CPC at fixed price due to lack of competitive bids. CEB considers diesel uneconomical but uses temporarily to meet demand until other power plants restored.

🟩

The Ceylon Electricity Board has issued a special announcement on supplying fuel to thermal power plants.

It states that some recent newsletters are expected to explain the word 'fuel'.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (Ceylon Electricity Board) is also used to generate three types of fuel to generate electricity.

* Receipt oil (HFO) - 715.3 GWh (5.8% of total electricity production) in 2024

* Napatha (Naphatha) - 235.5 GWH (1.9% of the total electric production) in 2024

* Diesel (Diesel) - 133.1 GWH (1.1% of total electric production) in 2024

Both credits (HFO) and Naupta (Naphatha) are bypace on the oil refinery.

Since there is no other supplier, the Ceylon Electricity Board is purchased by CPC from an anciently agreed price.

Competitive bidding is diesel, and some of them have recently commenced their business for diesel.

However, even under the management of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Diesel has not purchased competitive bids for electricity generation.

### Sri Lanka’s Kotagala Plantations downgraded three steps to CCC(lka) after wage hike

*2024-10-18 11:38:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-kotagala-plantations-downgraded-three-steps-to-ccclka-after-wage-hike-184121/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka’s Kotagala Plantations by three levels to ‘CCC(lka)’ from ‘B+(lka)’ and its listed unsecured debentures four steps to CCC-(lka) after a state driven wage hike.

“We expect the statutory increase in labour costs effective September 2024 to dampen free cash flow (FCF), leading to a high likelihood that Kotagala will amend or extend the terms of its debt facilities as they fall due over the next two years,” Fitch Ratings said.

“We are likely to consider such transactions to be distressed debt-exchanges under our rating criteria, as they would significantly reduce the contract terms and allow the issuer to avoid a probable default.

“This would lead to a downgrade of the National Long-Term Rating to ‘C(lka)’ or ‘RD(lka)’ (restricted default).”

Margins will be hit by depressed plantation yields, due to labour shortages and ageing crops, Fitch said.
