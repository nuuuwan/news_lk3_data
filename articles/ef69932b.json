    "Never a dull day in Sri Lanka! Hardly a day passes without some controversy or another making headlines and even leading to protests. Issues crop up at such a rapid pace that it is not possible to keep track of them, much less understand them.",
    "The latest controversy is about the education sector, which is no stranger to protests and strikes. A government decision to introduce education reforms has caused quite a stir, with school teachers, their trade unions and university dons letting out howls of protests. The protesters are hauling Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, who is also the Minister of Education, and the Education Ministry officials over the coals for what they describe as a move, inter alia, to sideline history as a school subject. The reforms, in their opinion, are ill-conceived. The Premier has sought to clear the air, but her voice has been drowned in the din of angry protests.",
    "There has been no extensive debate on the proposed education reforms, which have entered the public domain in dribs and drabs, and therefore look ad hoc. The Education Ministry may have striven to make them known to the public, but its efforts do not seem to have yielded the desired results. There is a need for a wider public discussion on the issue.",
    "Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya has experience as a seasoned campaigner for education reforms and protecting free education. She actively participated in protest marches in defence of free education under previous governments, demanding more funds for the education sector and better salaries for university teachers, when she was in the groves of academe. Ironically, most of the critics of her education reform package, as it were, are her former university colleagues, who strongly backed the NPP, enabling it to gain a great deal of legitimacy and win elections impressively. Today, some of them are accusing her of following in the footsteps of Ranil Wickremesinghe, who once got into hot water as a Minister of Education over a controversial White Paper. So, the task before the Prime Minister is to sell her education reforms to her former colleagues and secure their support for her mission. She should be able to engage them as well as other stakeholders including school teachers, their trade unions, students, professional associations, and opinion leaders in discussions on the reform package in question.",
    "The incumbent government has a stock excuse for its failure to achieve progress in key sectors; it says it has been in power only for a few months, and Rome was not built in a day. This argument is not wholly untenable in that a government cannot perform miracles, but the question is how the NPP administration has managed to handle a complex, formidable task like introducing education reforms, albeit not far-reaching, so quickly. Its selective efficiency is amazing.",
    "The NPP government declared in its election manifestos its intention to introduce education reforms, which are in fact long overdue. So, it is duty bound to fulfil that pledge. One of the main criticisms of Sri Lanka\u2019s education system is that it has failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing world and placed excessive emphasis on examinations, thereby taking the fun out of learning. Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya was heard saying, at a public function, the other day, that it was difficult to make some students attend school regularly.",
    "However, reforming an education system is an extremely complex task that must be handled cautiously however urgent it may be. There are various schools of thought about education reforms besides global trends which keep changing, with various new theories being expounded about education and its goals. Basically, the purpose of an education system is not solely to produce skilled workers for industries to achieve economic development and bring down unemployment rate but nurture citizens who are intellectually well-rounded, civically informed and engaged, adaptable in employment, equipped to face present and future challenges and capable of contributing to national progress.",
    "Some of the key components of a strategy to bring about reforms in any key sector successfully are engaging stakeholders and aligning political and institutional support for them. Those who have undertaken the unenviable task of reforming Sri Lanka\u2019s education system, which is crying out for change, should heed the oxymoronic, classical adage\u2014Festina lente (\u2018make haste slowly\u2019).",
    "The best course of action available to the government, in our opinion, is to put its education reforms on hold, and initiate a comprehensive discussion with the key stakeholders who claim that their views have not been ascertained.",
