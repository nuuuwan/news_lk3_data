On behalf of the Sri Lanka-Maldives Business Council, I extend our heartfelt congratulations on your appointment as President of Sri Lanka. Your leadership comes at a pivotal time for both Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and we are eager to explore the opportunities that lie ahead. We look forward to collaborating closely with you to strengthen the ties between our countries and promote mutual growth.

While our export revenue has grown to $ 163 million in 2023, it has not kept pace with overall market growth, resulting in a decline in our market share in the Maldives, which now stands at 4.65%, down from approximately 7.02% eight years ago. This decline highlights the need for concerted efforts to enhance our presence in this vital market.

### The power of the cross and a crossover in power styles

*2024-09-27 23:41:16* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-power-of-the-cross-and-a-crossover-in-power-styles/4-767255) · `en`

The power of that cross must slowly but surely transform the nature, principles and practice of power in the land. Else it would be only a transactional double-cross fit for the dustbin of history – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In the run-up to the Presidential election of 2024, the then emerging aspirant for executive office Anura Kumara Dissanayake once waxed eloquent about “the power of the cross” (‘kathiraya’).

He intimated that it was not simply, deceptively, one person’s expressed preference for a particular individual; but rather, a powerful exercise of the franchise which could reap a wide-ranging harvest of repercussions.

Rest assured that those ramifications are being felt in nation, state, country, bureaucracy and beyond today. For better or for worse, only time will tell.

U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged New York City Mayor Eric Adams with accepting illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel from Turkish nationals seeking to influence him, capping an investigation that has sent the largest U.S. city’s government into turmoil.

In a 57-page indictment, prosecutors laid out an alleged scheme stretching back to 2014 that helped to underwrite Adams’ 2021 mayoral campaign and showered him with free rooms at opulent hotels and meals at high-end restaurants.

In return, Adams pressured city officials to allow the country’s new 36-story consulate to open despite safety concerns, prosecutors said.

The Democrat faces five criminal charges and could face decades in prison if found guilty.

Adams, 64, denied wrongdoing and said he would fight the charges in court. He said he would not step down.

“I will continue to do my job as mayor,” he said at a news conference, where some onlookers called on him to resign.
