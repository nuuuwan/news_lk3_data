Sri Lanka SLPP calls for suspension of diplomatic ties with MP over fake degree claims

🟩

The Sri Lanka PA (SLPP) Jaffna District Organizer Geetanath Kasilingam has said that the diplomatic community should temporarily suspend his contacts amid increasing allegations of the credibility of the educational qualifications of Parliament Ashoka Sabumal Ranwala.

During the recently concluded parliamentary elections, Ranwala had misrepresented his credentials by using the title "Doctor".

There have been accusations that the Speaker should not graduate from doctorate, which raises questions about his honesty and accountability.

"It is unacceptable to be a Speaker who portrayed fake qualifications," Kasilingam said. "The public should be interpreted on this obvious scam."

Kasilingam asked President Dissanayake to begin an immediate inquiry into the matter. He emphasized the importance of transparency and urged the authorities to quickly solve these issues to maintain the credibility of the parliamentary organization of Sri Lanka.
