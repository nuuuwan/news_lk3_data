    "In recent times, journalist Uvindu Kurukulasuriya has become a subject of intense public debate, primarily due to his vocal criticisms of the current government and the President\u2019s certain policies on social media. Many have accused him of being politically biased or aligned with the National People\u2019s Power (NPP). As someone who has followed Uvindu\u2019s work for years, I felt compelled to reflect on this discourse \u2014 not to defend or attack, but to explore the deeper implications for media responsibility and national dialogue.",
    "Before the last election, I too found myself questioning Uvindu\u2019s apparent transformation. For a long time, he maintained a reputation as a media professional who observed political developments from a distance, seemingly without any allegiance or influence. His sudden shift toward strong political commentary in favor of NPP was difficult to reconcile with the personaI had come to recognize.",
    "What stood out was not just his critique, but the way he communicated it \u2014 directly, clearly, and, more importantly, with a sense of responsibility. He continues to highlight systemic shortcomings, not as partisan attacks, but as necessary interventions in a democratic society. This kind of scrutiny should not be feared or vilified; it should be welcomed by any government that values accountability.",
    "Today, more than ever, Sri Lanka needs constructive criticism \u2014 particularly when it concerns key national issues. One such issue that has received insufficient attention in the broader political discourse is the development of our ocean economy.",
    "Despite repeated mentions of the Blue Economy and Ocean Economy in policy documents and government statements, there is little clarity about the actual strategies in place. As a nation surrounded by ocean, the potential for maritime-based economic growth \u2014 from fisheries and shipping to marine biodiversity and tourism \u2014 is enormous. Yet the current narrative around this sector remains vague, fragmented, and often lost amid political noise.",
    "This is why I am calling on public intellectuals, journalists, and especially those like Uvindu \u2014 who have the platform and reach \u2014 to bring this issue into sharper focus. We need more than surface-level discussions. We need deep, evidence-based journalism that questions the status quo, demands transparency from policymakers, and sparks informed public debate about the future of Sri Lanka\u2019s maritime resources.",
    "At a time when the world is rapidly moving toward sustainable and ocean-centric development models, Sri Lanka cannot afford to lag behind due to a lack of strategic vision or communication. Media voices play a vital role in shaping that vision \u2014 not by aligning with political forces, but by holding them accountable, regardless of their affiliations.",
    "Constructive criticism is not a threat to governance; it is a cornerstone of democracy. And when it comes to the ocean economy, it is time we stop floating in ambiguity and start steering toward clarity."
