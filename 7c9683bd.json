    "The Sri Lankan Government has reportedly refused to grant a visa to Canadian MP Gary Anandasangaree.",
    "Anandasangaree, also Parliamentary Secretary to a Cabinet minister had once called Sri Lanka \u201ca failed and bankrupt state\u201d when Sri Lanka received an IMF bailout.",
    "MP Anandasangaree tweeted alleging that he has been refused a visa because of the work he does.",
    "\u201cFree speech apparently is allowed when it suits the government. Burning effigies will not correct the failures of consecutive GOSLs. Regrettably, Sri Lanka has refused my visa out right. It\u2019s reprisal for the work we do. We will not be silenced,\u201d he tweeted."
