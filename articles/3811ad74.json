    "(Reuters) -The main U.N. aid agency operating in Gaza said on Saturday that acute malnutrition was accelerating in the north of the Palestinian enclave as Israel prepared to send a delegation to Qatar for new ceasefire talks on a hostage deal with Hamas.",
    "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said one in three children under the age of two in northern Gaza is now acutely malnourished, putting more pressure on Israel over the looming famine.",
    "On Friday, Israel said it would send a delegation to Qatar for more talks with mediators after its enemy Hamas presented a new proposal for a ceasefire with an exchange of hostages and prisoners.",
    "The delegation will be led by the head of Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea, a source familiar with the talks said, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeking to convene the security cabinet to discuss the proposal before the talks start. Netanyahu\u2019s office has said the Hamas offer was still based on \u201cunrealistic demands.\u201d",
    "Efforts failed repeatedly to secure a temporary ceasefire before Islam\u2019s holy month of Ramadan started a week ago, with Israel saying it plans to launch a new offensive in Rafah, the last relatively safe city in tiny, crowded Gaza after five months of war.",
    "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, starting a two-day visit to the region, voiced concern about an assault on Rafah, saying there was a danger it would result \u201cin many terrible civilian casualties\u201d.",
    "On Friday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said he had approved an attack plan on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million residents are sheltering, and that the civilian population would be evacuated. It gave no time frame and there was no immediate evidence of extra preparations on the ground.",
    "The Hamas offer, reviewed by Reuters, foresees dozens of Israeli hostages freed in return for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, during a weeks-long ceasefire that would let more aid into Gaza. Hamas also called for talks in a later stage on ending the war, but Israel has said it is only willing to negotiate a temporary truce.",
    "Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Arabic broadcaster Al Jazeera the group\u2019s proposal is so realistic that \u201cno one can object to it\u201d and claimed that mediators had reacted positively.",
    "He said it consists of two stages, with a complete \u201ccessation of aggression\u201d at the start of the second one - something Israel has rejected, vowing to resume its goal of destroying Hamas once any temporary truce expires.",
    "Families of Israeli hostages and their supporters again gathered in Tel Aviv, urging a deal for their release.",
    "At the same time, anti-government protesters, estimated by Israeli media at a few thousand, called for new elections and blocked streets in Tel Aviv.",
    "The war began on Oct. 7 when Hamas sent fighters into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",
    "Israel\u2019s ground and air campaign has killed more than 31,500 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Israel says it has killed at least 13,000 Hamas members in the Gaza fighting.",
    "The assault has also devastated the enclave, forcing nearly all the inhabitants from their homes, leaving much of the territory in rubble and triggering a massive hunger crisis.",
    "\u201cChildren\u2019s malnutrition is spreading fast and reaching unprecedented levels in Gaza,\u201d UNRWA said in a social media post. Hospitals in Gaza have reported some children dying of malnutrition and dehydration.",
    "Western countries have called on Israel to do more to allow in aid, with the U.N. saying it faced \u201coverwhelming obstacles\u201d including crossing closures, onerous vetting, restrictions on movement and unrest inside Gaza.",
    "Israel says it puts no limit on humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and blames slow aid delivery on incapacity or inefficiency among U.N. agencies.",
    "A first delivery into Gaza by the World Central Kitchen, pioneering a new sea route via Cyprus, arrived on Friday and was off-loaded, the charity said.",
    "On Saturday, a second cargo of food aid was ready to depart by sea from Cyprus, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said, while the U.S. and Jordan said they carried out an air drop of humanitarian aid.",
    "Queen Rania of Jordan, in a CNN interview, called the airdrops \u201cliterally just drops in the ocean of unmet needs\u201d and accused Israel of \u201ccutting off everything that is required to sustain a human life: food, fuel, medicine, water.\u201d"
