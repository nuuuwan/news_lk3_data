    "We have little say about restrictions being imposed on us from abroad. Somehow, we have to stand on our feet. In the distant past we did have programs that tackled poverty and enabled people to produce what we need. However today no attempt is being made to help people to become entrepreneurs, to produce what Sri Lanka requires, and in that process earn foreign exchange and also help reduce imports.",
    "This economic demise has been a process that commenced after 1977, when we started following the Structural Adjustment Program of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A condition insisted upon was that all development programmes had to be curtailed or abolished. There should be no new programs of development. Truly from 1977 there has not been a single new development program.",
    "All that has been approved are of the Samurdhi and Aswesuma type of making donations to the poor. Departments that dealt with economic development were either abolished or sidelined.",
    "During Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake\u2019s tenure we were self-sufficient in rice. I too played a part in that cultivation programme and have first-hand experience as I served as the Additional Government Agent in Kegalle in 1968 and 1969.",
    "Paddy production is of crucial importance because we have had to import very large quantities of rice almost every year recently, spending a great deal of foreign exchange. Paddy production was handled by the Department of Agriculture for long. They had a full staff at district level, an agricultural instructor with two years training at the divisional level, and at the village level, an agricultural overseer with a year\u2019s training.",
    "That effort was strengthened with the implementation of the Paddy Lands Act by the Agrarian Services Department, which for the first time brought about an elected body of cultivators and land owners that planned paddy production.",
    "In Anuradhapura, we had 296 cultivation committees and there was a staff of three Assistant Commissioners, 10 Divisional Officers and 50 Field Assistants. I can remember meetings of cultivators going on till late in the night and we decided on using certified high yielding seed paddy and the appropriate use of fertilizer. This effort was well organized.",
    "Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake (1965-1970) took over the implementation of paddy production and brought in the Government Agents to lead the programme in each district. The production of paddy had been assessed by the Department of Agriculture. Dudley was not satisfied with that systems and decided that the yield of paddy be estimated by staff officers of departments other than the Department of Agriculture, and also done on a plot identified by random sampling. Thus, the production was correctly estimated. As a result of this effort, we achieved self-sufficiency in rice.",
    "After 1970 the Government Agents were to concentrate on the new programme \u2013 the Divisional Development Councils Programme (DDCP) and paddy production was given less emphasis. The system of crop cuttings done by staff officers of department other than the Department of Agriculture was stopped.",
    "The government had from the fifties a paddy purchasing programme where a high price was given to genuine cultivators. This was discontinued. Two more changes took place and the Department of Agrarian Services was more or less abolished and the Agriculture Department paddy production programme was scaled down by President Premadasa promoting all agricultural overseers \u2013 numbering some 2,300 \u2013 to become Grama Niladharis in 1997.",
    "The work done by agricultural overseers ceased and a few years later a cadre of untrained Yaya Palakas were appointed. Thus, today the paddy production effort is totally unorganized. Many seed farms were privatized and thus no certified seed paddy is available. It is no wonder that we have had to import rice and unless a definite plan to bolster paddy production is built from scratch, Sri Lanka will have to import very large quantities of rice every year.",
    "The introduction of Provincial Councils and devolving agriculture to them has also eaten into efficiency. Earlier a circular by me, when I worked in the Agrarian Services Department, sent by post to all overseers had to be acted upon the next day, after devolving agriculture to the provincial councils the instructions had to be sent via Divisional Ministers of Agriculture.",
    "The production of vegetables and fruit is also unorganized because the Department of Agriculture does not have a field officer \u2013 the agricultural overseer \u2013 at the village level which it had till 1997.",
    "From the days of World War II, a Marketing Department \u2013 a Department for the Development of Agricultural Marketing \u2013 was established to help the marketing of agricultural produce. This department was abolished in 1977, with the country implementing the Structural Adjustment Programme of the IMF.",
    "Today all producers are at the mercy of traders. When the Marketing Department functioned producers could hand over vegetables and fruit to the Marketing Department. Then vegetables and fruit were purchased and sent to Tripoli Market , the headquarters of the program, where goods were sent to some 50 outlets in Colombo for sale at low prices.",
    "This made traders too to sell at low prices if they were to be in business. The aim of the Marketing Department was to offer high prices to producers as well as sell at low prices to city dwellers. The abolition of the Marketing Department happened in 1981. It may be a good idea to reestablish the department",
    "Aswesuma, the poverty alleviation programme of today that gives money to the poor and deprived people, is only a continuation of the Samurdhi and the Janasaviya Programmes of public assistance. Janasaviya included training of beneficiaries to become productive as an integral part. This programme unfortunately folded with the demise of President Premadasa. Samurdhi too made an attempt at training people but the attempt was a failure. If Aswesuma is to be a success it should include a program to train the recipients to become entrepreneurs \u2013 thus producing what the country needs.",
    "Sri Lanka is a country blessed with fertile soil and ample regular rainfall, which enables the production of paddy and other crops. We had the organization for handling production, which has been dismantled by reducing the staff of the Department of Agriculture, the almost total abolition of the Department of Agrarian Services and the abolition of the Marketing Department.",
    "For instance, the Marketing Department established a canning factory in 1955 and in three years by 1958, we became self-sufficient in all fruit drinks and fruit produce Today, unfortunately we depend on imported fruit and fruit drinks imported from countries ranging from India, Cyprus and the USA. There goes our foreign exchange In dairy produce too we depend on imports. We do not have a real program to develop animal husbandry. We must expand the number of veterinary surgeons and implement a program for people to rear cattle.",
    "In industry too, we were till 1977 having a well-developed programme of handlooms and power looms that enabled us to be self-sufficient in manufacturing textiles. In 1977 we abolished this programme and the Department of Small Industries was totally eliminated. Until 1977, we met all our textile requirements.",
    "Sri Lankans who had migrated to the UK when they visited Sri Lanka on holiday came searching for suiting produced by the Hakmana Powerloom. When they could not find Hakmana suiting in the shops they came to the Hakmana Powerloom and when they found that too difficult, approached me \u2013 as the Government Agent who controlled the Powerlooms.",
    "In 1958 I was working in Ambalantota and my duties took me often to Weerawila where during the cropping season the air was full of cotton pollen wafting in the air. Sadly, we gave up cultivating cotton. Three large stores built for collecting cotton were taken over by me for storing paddy. Cotton can be grown in Hambantota and Mannar/Vavuniya areas.",
    "Under the Divisional Development Councils Programme of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike (1970-1976) we established many small industries all over the island. Special mention is due of the paper making at Kotmale ,and the boat making industry at Matara where we made seagoing boats and sold them to fisheries cooperatives,",
    "At Matara on our own, we established a crayon factory . It took three months for my Planning Officer, Vetus Fernando, a chemistry honours graduate to master the art of making a crayon of a standard equal to Reeves, the best of the day. It took two weeks for Sumanapala Dahanayake, the member of parliament for Deniyaya, in his capacity as the President of the Co-op Union to establish a crayon factory under my immediate direction. Within a month crayons made by the Morawaka Cooperative Union were sold islandwide.",
    "Therein lies the path if our Government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is interested in developing industries in Sri Lanka. It is a task that can be easily achieved. We can establish many industries to manufacture some of what we import today.",
    "I can state that Sri Lanka can produce all the rice, maize, fruit and vegetables it requires \u2013 all items that can be cultivated and harvested within one year. When I served as Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services in Anuradhapura, I asked for approval to produce all the maize Sri Lanka required in one season. We had vibrant cultivation committees to handle that task. Fruits like oranges will require a longer program. Let us not forget that we have a fertile land with ample regular rain.",
    "Let me end with a bit of what I achieved in Bangladesh in creating entrepreneurs. I served there as the Commonwealth Fund Advisor on Youth Development. When General Ershard took over the country it was widely feared that the youth development activities would be abolished. At the final meeting the minister asked for my recommendation. I urged that instead of abolishing the Ministry, the Government should establish a youth employment program.",
    "The Secretary to the Treasury, the highest officer in Bangladesh, said that he would not release any funds because the ILO had failed to do that task at Tangail in the earlier three years. I argued with him \u2013 a one to one battle for two hours. The minister stopped us arguing and approved my establishing an employment creation program. This was done in 19 months and that was in 1983.",
    "It is a programme that has by now made over three million youth entrepreneurs. It has been documented in eight pages in the Five-Year Programme of Bangladesh and is continuing.",
    "In 2011,when Milinda Moragoda, who was our High Commissioner in Delhi made a bid for the Mayoralty of Colombo, in his manifesto stated that if elected, he would seek to implement the Youth Self Employment Program of Bangladesh which incidentally was am amazingly successful scheme introduced to that country by a distinguished son of Sri Lanka, Dr Garvin Karunaratne, who served in Bangladesh as an international consultant.\u201d(The Nation:  11/9/2011)",
    "I hope I have had the opportunity to awaken our new Government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. (The writer is former Government Agent for Matara)",
