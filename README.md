### Welcome, Comrade Anura!

*2024-09-23 16:18:39* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/welcome-comrade-anura/) · `en`

It’s official – Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the ninth Executive President of Sri Lanka.

For those who don’t know, between 1948 – when it obtained independence from the British Empire – and 1977, the highest elected political official in Sri Lanka was the Prime Minister. He or she – Sri Lanka has the distinction of electing the world’s first woman Prime Minister – was invested with a tremendous array of powers, while the President served a more ceremonial role.

In 1978, the government of JR Jayewardene enacted a new Constitution which transformed the office of the Prime Minister into that of an all-powerful, almost omniscient Executive President. The then Prime Minister’s rationale was that the parliamentary system which had prevailed until then had become a hindrance to the head of state and that the country required a new political arrangement which would shield its leaders from the vagaries of parliamentary politics.

### Trump’s second “apparent” assassination attempt

*2024-09-23 16:06:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/trumps-second-apparent-assassination-attempt/) · `en`

In view of this weekend’s elections in Sri Lanka, I had decided to take the week off, as few would have any interest in American politics. In spite of the strangest “apparent” assassination attempt on former president and current Republican candidate for the 2024 presidency, Donald J. Trump.

However, some news items this Friday morning from the US bemused me so much that I decided to pen a few lines in an attempt to beat the deadline, especially, as they required little creativity and less controversy.

The assassination attempt was made on the morning of last Sunday, September 15, when Trump was playing an unscheduled round of golf on his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida.

I used the word “strangest” because plans for this round of golf was not on the official schedule given the previous day to the secret service detail responsible for the security of a former president of the United States. The decision to play golf was made by Trump on the morning of that Sunday.

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

In early 1972, the US government extended an invitation to me and to the Public Trustee, Mr. Barnes Ratwatte, to visit America under one of their leadership grants. The period was to be close upon a month. I was reluctant to ask the PM time off for such a long program. But she had heard about it, and wanted me to go. She was convinced that I needed a break, and said “At this rate you will fall ill.” This was both unselfish and gracious of her.

With a presidential election due on 21 September amid widespread economic misery, 2024 is a pivotal year for Sri Lanka. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has enjoyed some success carrying out International Monetary Fund (IMF) reforms, but millions of Sri Lankans mired in poverty and debt have yet to feel much relief. Wickremesinghe came to power in July 2022 after his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to resign following waves of mass protest; but he owes his appointment to the Rajapaksa clan’s political party, and he has relied on it for his majority in parliament.

It is totally unnecessary to explain the choice of subject of my article today – the day after the presidential election.

After all, our Sunday newspapers are printed on the Saturday night, some even on Friday. Most unlikely a stop press announcement will be made in the print media.

The definition of a statesman is: “A skilled, experienced, and respected political leader or figure.” Are any of Sri Lanka’s 39 contenders for the presidency such? A definite no is the answer I get from myself.

*2024-09-23 15:40:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/194580) · `ta`

Challenges in new government: Election delays, potential dissolution, Tamil parliamentary election complexities, party divisions, diaspora involvement, state occupation issues, accountability concerns, international pressure needed for solutions.

🟩

The presidential election results will be fully arrived in the evening of the 22nd. However, if the 2nd and 3rd preferential votes are counted, it may be delayed.

Probably a situation where parliament can be dissolved following the election. If so, the parliamentary election will come before the end of this year.

As far as Tamil politics is concerned, the parliamentary election will be a big challenge. It is not possible to say that how many teams will compete from the Tamil nationality. Three or four teams have the opportunity to compete.

The Tamil National Party can contest alone, the Tamil National People's Front and the Democratic Tamil National Alliance alone.

May try to put pressure on them to go to the coalition. At least the Tamil state party and the Democratic Tamil National Alliance may be forced to act as the Old Tamil National Alliance.

The Tamil state party is now clearly divided and many difficulties in making decisions.

### JVP’s hidden ideology and post-election risk: Interview with Dayan Jayatilleka

Sri Lanka stands at a historic crossroads as it approaches its ninth presidential election, scheduled for September 21. This moment carries profound implications for the nation’s political and social fabric. The election arrives in the wake of a tumultuous period where public outcry led to the ousting of the sitting president and the emergence of a new leader through constitutional maneuvering. Out of the 39 candidates, one has passed away, while those remaining vie for the top seat. Despite the previous elections being effectively two-horse races, three main contenders have emerged this time. In this climate of uncertainty and transformation, I met with one of the country’s leading political scientist, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka—a scholar, diplomat, and thinker of considerable depth—to explore not only the intricate state of Sri Lankan politics but also the shifting tectonic plates of the global order.

*2024-09-23 15:04:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102214/chinas-president-says-hopes-to-deepen-ties-with-sri-lankas-new-leader) · `en`

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday said he hoped to broaden cooperation with Sri Lanka under his Belt and Road infrastructure initiative (BRI) as he congratulated the island nation’s new leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.

Dissanayaka took his oath at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on Monday, vowing to restore public faith in politics.

The country is emerging from a years-long economic collapse blamed partly on struggling high-debt Chinese mega-projects coordinated through the BRI, the massive infrastructure project that is a central pillar of Xi’s bid to expand his country’s clout overseas.

“I attach great importance to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations and am willing to work with Mr. President to continue our traditional friendship (and) enhance mutual political trust,” Xi said in a message to Dissanayaka, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

Xi said he hoped bilateral cooperation under his flagship BRI would “bear more fruit”, CCTV added.

Saturday’s election of the country’s first leftist president, Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, had given the family “a renewed sense of hope” of justice, Wickrematunge’s daughter Ahimsa said.

“We are hopeful that this leadership will bring a fresh perspective into finally addressing the atrocities that have taken place in Sri Lanka’s recent human rights history,” she said in a statement.

Wickrematunge had accused then defence ministry secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa of taking kickbacks in arms procurements, including the purchase of second-hand MiG jet fighters from Ukraine.

🟩

Dissanayake, also known as AKD, has a very common family b;

This election result is a testament to the pain experienced by Sri Lankans who are impoverished during the economic crisis.

For Aadi's struggle against corruption;His requests to provide more welfare services to the people have a widespread support.

The weakness of the election winner is that his coalition managed a complex government like Sri Lanka.

The implementation of many of their promises in the most challenging economic environment may be a very challenging issue.

During his election campaign, AK India extended its allies to the West.

This is an election that has no significance in Sri Lanka's election campaign, chauvinism and racism.

Many Western countries can learn lessons from the silence of this election and the defeat of Sajit Preadasa and Ranilwickramasinghe, who lost the election.
