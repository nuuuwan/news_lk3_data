    "At an \u201cInvest Maldives\u201d forum in a southern Chinese port city, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu shook hands and exchanged words with smiling local officials on a China visit set to deepen bilateral ties as the archipelagic nation pirouettes away from India.",
    "After the forum in Fuzhou on Tuesday, Muizzu and his delegation will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang in Beijing during his week-long visit, where pacts from infrastructure to tourism are expected to be signed.",
    "Muizzu became president of the Indian Ocean nation in November after winning on his \u201cIndia Out\u201d campaign platform under which he called New Delhi\u2019s huge influence a threat to sovereignty. His government has since asked dozens of locally based Indian military personnel to leave. And in an apparent snub to India, Muizzu is in China this week, before any visit to his country\u2019s giant neighbour.",
    "In Fuzhou, the Chinese city designated as the start of China\u2019s maritime \u201cSilk Road\u201d, Muizzu said China remained one of his country\u2019s \u201cclosest allies and developmental partners\u201d, according to a statement released by his office.",
    "Increasing export of fish products to China under the two countries\u2019 free trade agreement will be a key priority, Muizzu added.",
    "Fishing is the largest source of employment in the Maldives, where 99% of its territory comprises the sea. Aquatic products account for over 98% of exports by volume and value.",
    "Muizzu also said his government was keen to explore partnerships under Xi\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, including the expansion of the country\u2019s central airport and commercial port.",
    "Under the Belt and Road Initiative aimed at building a global trade and infrastructure network, China has already helped expand the Velana International Airport in Male and built the cross-sea China-Maldives Friendship Bridge.",
    "Chinese firms have invested $1.37 billion in the Maldives since its decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative in 2014, data from the American Enterprise Institute think tank shows.",
    "In 2019, Chinese tourists represented 19.7% of foreign visitors, making them the biggest tourist group, but slipped to third position by 2022 during the pandemic.",
    "The Maldives is also a popular destination among Indian nationals, whose presence has grown more prominent when China\u2019s pandemic restrictions kept Chinese visitors away.",
    "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was snorkelling last week in Lakshadweep, an archipelago of atolls and reefs off the coast of Kerala, a visit that some viewed as an attempt to draw tourists away from the nearby Maldivian islands.",
    "Modi\u2019s Lakshadweep visit prompted three Maldivian government officials to call him names including \u201ca clown\u201d, leading some Indian tourists to share screenshots of cancelled bookings of Maldivian holidays. #ExploreIndianIslands became a trending hashtag in India on X.",
    "One of India\u2019s largest travel platforms suspended flight bookings to the tourism-dependent Maldives on Monday .",
    "\u201cIndia\u2019s strained relations with certain countries in South Asia can be attributed to its perception of being the regional boss,\u201d China\u2019s Global Times reported on Monday, citing analysts.",
    "And, the newspaper added, quoting a Chinese academic, India\u2019s current \u201cnervousness\u201d about Muizzu\u2019s visit to China showed its \u201clack of confidence\u201d.",
    "But the World Bank, in a report in October, warned further cosying up to China could spell trouble in the Maldives, since the $1.37 billion it already owes the Asian giant represents around 20% of its public debt.",
    "China is the Maldives\u2019 biggest bilateral creditor, ahead of Saudi Arabia and India, which it owes $124 million and $123 million, respectively.",
    "Former president Mohamed Nasheed in 2018 called Beijing\u2019s lending \u201ca debt trap.\u201d Beijing rejects accusations its lending practices in developing economies are predatory.",
    "Male spent $162.3 million on interest payments between January to August 2023, the World Bank report said, up 15% from a year earlier and \u201cfar exceeding\u201d the annual average between 2014-2019 of $85 million.",
    "The World Bank cautioned a \u201cbuild-up of sovereign exposure\u201d had taken place during the pandemic and that there was a \u201clack of domestic investment opportunities,\u201d despite Muizzu\u2019s appeal for fresh Chinese funding.",
    "The \u201cInvest Maldives\u201d website lists \u201copportunities\u201d across 10 sectors, including tourism, renewable energy, banking and finance, and agriculture."
