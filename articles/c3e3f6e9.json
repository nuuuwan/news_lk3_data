    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe was expected to make a special statement, during his address to the nation on Wednesday, announcing his presidential candidacy. There was no such statement, but he made it abundantly clear that he would enter the fray. He did so by asking the public some rhetorical questions, followed by a warning. Having outlined how he had helped bring about economic stability and raise the country from the depths of despair, he posed these queries: \u201cWill you move forward with me, who comprehended the problem from its inception, offered practical solutions, and delivered results? Or, will you align with those grappling in the dark, still struggling to grasp the issues? Will you stay the course towards a brighter future for yourself and the nation? Or, will you opt for a different path?\u201d Then came his warning, \u201cWe are all aware of the perils of veering off course or choosing the wrong path. Therefore, make the right decision. You have the full right and freedom to make that choice.\u201d Pointing out that he had brought the country out of bankruptcy and economic turmoil in just two years although his party, the UNP, had only a single seat in Parliament, he indicated that he would be able to do much more for the nation if he was elected President with the UNP being voted into office.",
    "President Wickremesinghe did not forget to take swipes at the other presidential hopefuls, Sajith Premadasa (SJB) and Anura Kumara Dissanayake (NPP). He said, \u201cThey traverse Sri Lanka seeking power, visiting schools and travelling the world in relentless pursuit of authority.\u201d His reference was obviously to Premadasa, who is seen at schools, making political speeches, and Dissanayake, who has caught the travel bug. The President used Premadasa and Dissanayake as a foil in a bid to highlight his brand of patriotism and service to the nation. \u201cI dedicate my days and nights to serving the country, addressing the needs of our people, and launching economic strengthening programmes. I engage globally to garner international support for our nation\u2019s development.\u201d",
    "On listening to President Wickremesinghe, on Wednesday, one was reminded of Bertolt Brecht, not because of his references to characters and imagery in the Brechtian play, The Caucasian Chalk Circle, to drive his points home. Brecht\u2019s poem, \u2018A worker reads history\u2019, came to mind when the President made claims such as \u2018I have safely guided the child named Mother Sri Lanka through treacherous waters\u2019. Brecht says in his poem, among other things: Who built the seven gates of Thebes? /The books are filled with names of kings. /Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone? \u2026 Young Alexander conquered India. /He alone? /Caesar beat the Gauls. /Was there not even a cook in his army?",
    "When the LTTE was defeated militarily in 2009, the UNP insisted that the credit for the war victory had to go to the then army Commander Gen. Sarath Fonseka, and not President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who, as the Commander-in-Chief and Minister of Defence, provided unwavering political leadership for the war; it together with its allies fielded Fonseka as a presidential candidate in 2010. But today it says the credit for what has so far been achieved on the economic front should go to its leader, President Wickremesinghe! After the defeat of the LTTE, the UNP argued that Mahinda should not be allowed to have himself re-elected by claiming that he had won the war, but the UNP now claims that President Wickremesinghe should be elected President because of the semblance of economic stability that has been achieved on his watch during the past two years. The UNP finds itself in a contradiction, a huge one at that. Duplicity is the thief of credibility.",
    "The war-winning President Rajapaksa failed during his second term because his administration became a haven for crooks. It is not fair to deny President Wickremesinghe the credit for his political leadership for saving the economy; but for his bold decisions and decisive action, violent mobs would have plunged the country into anarchy by setting Parliament on fire in 2022, and making economic recovery well-nigh impossible. But we see the crooks who ruined the country during the UNP-led Yahapalana government and brought about the UNP\u2019s downfall in 2020, crawling out of the woodwork. They include various racketeers who have defaulted on bank loans to the tune of billions of rupees, got involved in the Treasury bond scandals and sullied their reputations by cutting numerous corrupt deals and having their palms greased. If President Wickremesinghe is seen to be carrying these characters also across the dilapidated vine bridge, he will lose whatever popular support he has been able to rally by steering the economy through the present crisis. He may be able to prevail over his political enemies, but it is doubtful whether even the millions of deities who are believed to have made this country their home will be able to save him from his \u2018friends\u2019 under a cloud.",
