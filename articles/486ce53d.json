  "original_body_lines": [
    "(AP) \u2014 The chief prosecutor of the world\u2019s top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war.",
    "While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened Israel\u2019s isolation over the war in Gaza.",
    "The court\u2019s prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders \u2014 Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh \u2014 of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.",
    "Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas.",
    "A panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions.",
    "Israel is not a member of the court, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate risk of prosecution. But the threat of arrest could make it difficult for the Israeli leaders to travel abroad.",
    "Netanyahu called the prosecutor\u2019s accusations against him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and attack on the Israeli military and all of Israel. He vowed to press ahead with Israel\u2019s war against Hamas militants.",
    "President Biden said the ICC prosecutor\u2019s desire to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant was \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding \u201cwhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2014 none \u2014 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d",
    "Hamas also denounced the ICC prosecutor\u2019s request to arrest its leaders, saying it \u201cequates the victim with the executioner.\u201d",
    "Netanyahu has come under heavy pressure at home to end the war sooner than later. Thousands of Israelis have joined weekly demonstrations calling on the government to reach a deal to bring home Israeli hostages in Hamas captivity, fearing that time is running out.",
    "In recent days, the two other members of his war Cabinet, Gallant and Benny Gantz, have threatened to resign if Netanyahu does not spell out a clear postwar vision for Gaza.",
    "But on Monday, Netanyahu received wall-to-wall support as politicians across the spectrum condemned the ICC prosecutor\u2019s move. They included Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, and his two main political rivals, Gantz and opposition leader Yair Lapid.",
    "It is unclear what effect Khan\u2019s move will have on Netanyahu\u2019s public standing. The possibility of an arrest warrant against Netanyahu, whose popularity has dropped during the war, could give him a boost as Israelis rally behind the flag. But his opponents could also blame him for bringing a diplomatic catastrophe on the country.",
    "Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at Hebrew University and the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, said it was far more certain that Netanyahu\u2019s already troubled international standing could be further weakened.",
    "\u201cThis is going to make Netanyahu an outcast, and his ability to move around the world will be seriously compromised,\u201d said Shany. Even if the ICC does not issue the arrest warrant, other countries may now be more reluctant to provide support and assistance, he said.",
    "Hamas is already considered an international terrorist group by the West. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. But Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar, like Israel, is not a member of the ICC.",
    "The latest war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, when militants from Gaza crossed into Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage.",
    "Since then, Israel has waged a brutal campaign to dismantle Hamas in Gaza. More than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, at least half of them women and children, according to the latest estimates by Gaza health officials.",
    "The war has triggered a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, displacing roughly 80% of the population and leaving hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of starvation, according to U.N. officials.",
    "Speaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said \u201cthe effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known. \u2026 They include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women.\u201d",
    "The United Nations and other aid agencies have repeatedly accused Israel of hindering aid deliveries throughout the war. Israel denies this, saying there are no restrictions on aid entering Gaza and accusing the U.N. of failing to distribute aid.",
    "Of the Hamas actions on Oct. 7, Khan, who visited the region in December, said that he saw for himself \u201cthe devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today.\u201d",
    "In their rampage, Hamas militants gunned down scores of revelers at a dance party and killed entire families as they huddled in their homes. \u201cThese acts demand accountability,\u201d Khan said.",
    "Israel is also facing a South African case in the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s top court, accusing Israel of genocide. Israel denies those charges.",
    "The ICC was established in 2002 as the permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the world\u2019s most heinous atrocities \u2014 war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression.",
    "The U.N. General Assembly endorsed the ICC, but the court is independent.",
    "Dozens of countries don\u2019t accept the court\u2019s jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and other crimes. They include Israel, the United States, Russia and China.",
    "The ICC becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory. Israel argues it has a functioning court system.",
    "The ICC accepted \u201cThe State of Palestine\u201d as a member in 2015, a year after the Palestinians accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
    "The court\u2019s chief prosecutor at the time announced in 2021 she was opening an investigation into possible crimes on Palestinian territory. Israel often levies accusations of bias at U.N. and international bodies, and Netanyahu condemned the decision as hypocritical and antisemitic.",
    "In 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump authorized economic and travel sanctions on the ICC prosecutor and another senior prosecutor. The ICC staff were looking into U.S. and allies\u2019 troops for possible war crimes in Afghanistan.",
    "Last year, the court issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. Russia responded by issuing its own arrest warrants for Khan and ICC judges."
