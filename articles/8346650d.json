    "Protesters took to the streets of Dhaka on Monday demanding the Bangladesh caretaker government to increase the age limit from 31 to 35 for government jobs. The fresh protest in the capital city came as the crisis-hit nation is still recovering from the political turmoil that erupted in August, leading to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.",
    "On Monday morning, the protesters gathered in front of the National Museum in the city\u2019s Shahbagh. From there, they started their march to Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus\u2019s official residence, Jamuna in Minto Road.",
