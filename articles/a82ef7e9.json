    "Russian authorities arrested the four men suspected of carrying out the attack on a suburban Moscow concert hall that killed at least 133 people and believe they were headed to Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said Saturday during an address to the nation.",
    "Kyiv, meanwhile, strongly denied any involvement in Friday\u2019s attack on the Crocus City Hall music venue in Krasnogorsk, which the Islamic State group\u2019s affiliate in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for in a statement posted in social media channels linked to the group. Kyiv accused Putin and other Russian politicians of falsely linking Ukraine to the assault in order to stoke fervor in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which recently entered its third year.",
    "A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that U.S. agencies had confirmed that IS was responsible for the assault and had previously warned Moscow that an attack could be imminent.",
    "Putin said authorities have detained a total of 11 people in the attack, which also injured scores of concertgoers and left the venue a smoldering ruin. He called it \u201ca bloody, barbaric terrorist act\u201d and said Russian authorities captured the four suspected gunmen as they were trying to escape to Ukraine through a \u201cwindow\u201d prepared for them on the Ukrainian side of the border.",
    "Putin also said that additional security measures have been imposed throughout Russia, and he declared Sunday a day of mourning.",
    "The attack, the deadliest in Russia in years, is a major embarrassment to the Russian leader and happened just days after he cemented his grip on the country for another six years in a vote that followed the harshest crackdown on dissent since the Soviet times.",
    "Some commentators on Russian social media questioned how authorities, who have relentlessly suppressed any opposition activities and muzzled independent media, failed to prevent the attack despite the U.S. warnings.",
    "The attack came two weeks after the U.S. embassy in Moscow issued a notice urging Americans to avoid crowded places in view of \u201cimminent\u201d plans by extremists to target large Moscow gatherings, including concerts. The warning was repeated by several other Western embassies.",
    "Investigators on Saturday were combing through the charred wreckage of the hall for more victims, and authorities said the death toll could still rise. Hundreds of people stood in line in Moscow early Saturday to donate blood and plasma, Russia\u2019s health ministry said.",
    "\u201cWe faced not just a thoroughly and cynically prepared terror attack, but a well-prepared and organized mass murder of peaceful innocent people,\u201d Putin said.",
    "His claim that the attackers tried to flee to Ukraine followed comments by Russian lawmakers who pointed the finger at Ukraine immediately after the attack. But Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied any involvement.",
    "\u201cUkraine has never resorted to the use of terrorist methods,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cEverything in this war will be decided only on the battlefield.\u201d",
    "Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry accused Moscow of using the attack to try to stoke fervor for its war efforts.",
    "\u201cWe consider such accusations to be a planned provocation by the Kremlin to further fuel anti-Ukrainian hysteria in Russian society, create conditions for increased mobilization of Russian citizens to participate in the criminal aggression against our country and discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
    "Images shared by Russian state media Saturday showed emergency vehicles still gathered outside the ruins of Crocus City Hall, which could hold more than 6,000 people and has hosted many big events, including the 2013 Miss Universe beauty pageant that featured Donald Trump and others.",
    "On Friday, crowds had gathered for a concert by the Russian rock band Picnic.",
    "Videos posted online showed gunmen in the venue shooting civilians at point-blank range. Russian news reports cited authorities and witnesses as saying the attackers threw explosive devices that started the fire, which eventually consumed the building and caused its roof to collapse.",
    "Dave Primov, who survived the attack, described the chaos to the AP as concertgoers rushed to leave the building: \u201cPeople began to panic, started to run and collided with each other. Some fell down and others trampled on them.\u201d",
    "Messages of outrage, shock and support for the victims and their families have streamed in from around the world.",
    "On Friday, the U.N. Security Council condemned \u201cthe heinous and cowardly terrorist attack\u201d and underlined the need for the perpetrators to be held accountable. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the terrorist attack \u201cin the strongest possible terms,\u201d his spokesman said.",
    "IS, which lost much of its ground after Russia\u2019s military action in Syria, has long targeted Russia. In a statement posted by the group\u2019s Aamaq news agency, IS\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate said it had attacked a large gathering of \u201cChristians\u201d in Krasnogorsk.",
    "In October 2015, a bomb planted by IS downed a Russian passenger plane over Sinai, killing all 224 people on board, most of them Russian vacation-goers returning from Egypt.",
    "The group, which operates mainly in Syria and Iraq but also in Afghanistan and Africa, also has claimed several attacks in Russia\u2019s volatile Caucasus and other regions in the past years. It recruited fighters from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.",
    "On March 7, just hours before the U.S. embassy warned about imminent attacks, Russia\u2019s top security agency said it had thwarted an attack on a synagogue in Moscow by an IS cell, killing several of its members in the Kaluga region near the Russian capital. A few days before that, Russian authorities said six alleged IS members were killed in a shootout in Ingushetia, in Russia\u2019s Caucasus region.",
    "A U.S. intelligence official told the AP that American intelligence agencies had gathered information in recent weeks that the IS branch was planning an attack in Moscow, and that U.S. officials had privately shared the intelligence earlier this month with Russian officials.",
    "Another U.S. official said the IS branch in Afghanistan had long targeted Russia and reiterated that no Ukrainians were involved in the attack.",
    "Both officials were briefed on the matter but weren\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence information and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.",
    "Just three days before the attack, Putin had publicly denounced the Western warnings of a potential terrorist attack as an attempt to intimidate Russians. \u201cAll that resembles open blackmail and an attempt to frighten and destabilize our society,\u201d he said at a meeting with top security officials."
