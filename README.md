But his critics charge that he is without experience in statesmanship. Being a first timer in presidency, his critics are technically correct because he does not have a track-record. But experience does not matter to a person who can quickly grasp an issue, has a ready ear to listen, and change himself suitably to an emerging diverse situation. He has shown this adaptability by accepting IMF’s EFF as the most pragmatic way forward for Sri Lanka without dragging the country to a destabilising shock as predicted by his critics.

### Representation of minority groups in Parliament is in danger

*2024-11-11 01:26:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Representation-of-minority-groups-in-Parliament-is-in-danger/4-769056) · `en`

Representation of minority groups in Sri Lanka’s Parliament appears to be in danger of weakening in the upcoming elections, which could affect their rights

The main national parties in Sri Lanka have had a history of nominating representatives from minority communities who have gone on to take leadership positions. This is changing now with minority politicians in these parties often feeling isolated and finding fewer opportunities to raise minority rights issues

Sri Lanka concluded its Presidential election on 21 September and elected a new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake from the NPP, which resulted in the dissolution of the Parliament before its maturity period. The Election Commission announced a Parliamentary election for 14 November 2024 with deadlines for nominations of candidates set for 11 October, 2024.

### The man who could have been the President!

*2024-11-11 01:00:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-man-who-could-have-been-the-President/4-769053) · `en`

Sri Lanka is currently on a path to establishing a government free of injustice, nepotism, fraud, bribery, and all forms of corruption. For this ambitious goal to be achieved, individuals of impeccable character must hold government positions, and citizens must likewise adopt a mindset that supports integrity and accountability in all capacities. Achieving a truly corruption-free state requires that the ruling party remain open to constructive criticism, and that its supporters welcome such feedback without becoming sycophants—rejecting good advice or silencing critics.

Lawyer Nagananda, a respected attorney in both Sri Lanka and England, is widely known for his unwavering commitment to fighting injustice and corruption in all its forms. His constructive criticism is imparted without bias toward any individual or party. Consequently, he has often been regarded as an enemy by many, finding support only among a few rational-minded individuals.
