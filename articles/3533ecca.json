    "Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country\u2019s history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly.",
    "The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis\u2019 sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military.",
    "Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on and Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8. There is also an escalating conflict with Iran which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups that threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration.",
    "And on Monday, Hamas showed that it was still putting up a fight. It launched rockets that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, as well as closer to the Gaza border.",
    "In Gaza, which is still buckling under the weight of the ongoing war, no formal commemorative event is planned. The massive destruction and displacement are a constant reminder of the retaliatory Israeli assault on the territory, which has no end in sight.",
    "Israelis were flocking to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and the soldiers wounded or killed trying to save them.",
    "At 6:29 a.m.\u00a0 the exact minute Hamas launched its attack\u00a0 the families of those killed at the Nova music festival, joined by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, gathered at the site where almost 400 revelers were gunned down and from where many others were taken hostage.",
    "After briefly playing the same trance music that was blared during the festival, hundreds of family members and friends of the victims stood for a moment of silence. One woman\u2019s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers away.",
    "\u201cWhen we are here, we are near our loved ones. This is the time they danced and fled,\u201d said Sigal Bar-On, whose niece, Yuval Bar-On, 25, and her fianc\u00e9 Moshe Shuva, 34, were supposed to get married in December 2023.",
    "At 6:31 a.m., four projectiles were launched from Gaza toward the very Israeli communities that came under fierce assault last year, the Israeli military said. The ceremony was not disrupted.",
    "Marking the moment Hamas\u2019 attack began a year ago, the families of hostages still held in Gaza about 100, a third of whom are said to be dead gathered near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren, replicating a custom from the the most solemn dates on the Israeli calendar, Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day.",
    "\u201cWe are here to remind (the hostages) that we haven\u2019t forgotten them,\u201d said Shiri Albag, whose daughter Liri is among the captives. Her message to Netanyahu: \u201cWe wont let you rest until all of them are back, every last one of them,\u201d she told the crowd, which hoisted posters bearing the faces of the hostages.",
    "A group representing the families of hostages announced that another captive was dead. Idan Shtivi, 28, was snatched from the Nova music festival and was believed to be alive. Israeli media reported he was killed during the attack and his body was taken into Gaza.",
    "The flags at the Israeli Knesset were lowered to half-staff and an official state ceremony focusing on acts of bravery and hope is set to be aired on Monday evening. The ceremony was prerecorded without an audience\u00a0 apparently to avoid potential disruptions in the southern city of Ofakim, where over two dozen Israelis were killed.",
    "But anger at the government\u2019s failure to prevent the attack and enduring frustration that it has not returned the remaining hostages prompted the families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv.",
    "That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back drastically over prohibitions on large gatherings due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah.",
    "Hamas\u2019 attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged some 250 into Gaza as hostages, continues to cast a shadow over daily life in Israel. For the dozens of hostages still in captivity, there is no end in sight to their struggle. Border communities have been upended and tens of thousands were displaced. Soldiers are being killed in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel faces ongoing international criticism over its wartime conduct, with two world courts examining its actions.",
    "The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million population and sparked a humanitarian crisis that has led to widespread hunger. It has also left the tiny coastal enclave ravaged beyond recognition as U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have repeatedly sputtered."
