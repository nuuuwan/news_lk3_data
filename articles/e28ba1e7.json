    "Former Chief Minister of the Eastern Province Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan has been summoned to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) tomorrow (12), in order to record a statement related to the allegations in the documentary aired by British television network \u2018Channel 4\u2019 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka.",
    "Speaking at a press conference held today (11), Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the CID has launched a probe into the relevant incident as per a complaint lodged by an organization with the Ministry of Public Security against the statement made by Azad Maulana to Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks.",

    "On 06 September 2023, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday (April 21) in 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded.",
    "Channel 4\u2019s new \u2018Dispatches\u2019 investigation titled \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s Easter Bombings\u2019 is a nearly 50-minute-long videos with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act.",

    "According to the documentary, Maulana, who has sought asylum overseas after facing fraud charges here, has witnessed a meeting in Puttalam in 2018, between the suicide bombers and a top Sri Lankan intelligence officer prior to the Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "Claiming that he had, on the directives of Pillayan, arranged the said meeting between then-army intelligence chief Major General Suresh Sallay and the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) members including its leader Zahran Hashim, Maulana said the plot to create insecurity in the country to pave way for former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later in 2019 was hatched over 2-3 years.",
    "The documentary, which recapped the country\u2019s political situation, also gave a lengthy commentary on former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s time in power and their attempts to return to power after election defeats.",
    "Recalling the 2009 disappearance of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga who was a prominent critic of the then-government, the \u2018Dispatches\u2019 investigation video claimed that Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s administration had formed a clandestine death squad called the \u2018Tripoli Platoon\u2019 with the support of Pillayan\u2019s group to crack down on anti-government media persons.",
    "It had interviewed former senior CID officer Nishantha Silva who was investigating the disappearance of Wickrematunga. He claimed that he found phone record evidence putting \u2018Tripoli Platoon\u2019 members at the scene and that Gotabaya Rajapaksa had \u2018direct monitoring\u2019 of this death squad.",
    "The documentary also presented testimonies from His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, journalist Frederica Jansz who was a witness in the \u2018White Flag\u2019 case, the brother of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga, former commissioner of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Ambika Satkunanathan and former diplomat Sarath Kongahage.",
    "However, Kongahage later accused the British television network of distorting his comments from the interview. Calling a media briefing on September 12, 2023, the former ambassador said Channel 4 had used his remarks out of context."
