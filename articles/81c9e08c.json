  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has not decided against competitive bidding in buying diesel for electricity generation though the usage of diesel has been kept minimum.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s new government came under fire over a reported move by the CEB to continue to purchase fuel without competitive bidding, and with a deal struck with state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Both CPC and CEB come under the Ministry of Energy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Daily Mirror newspaper earlier this week reported that CEB has decided not to go ahead with competitive procurement of fuel but to strike a deal with Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, reversing a decision by the earlier administration to move for open tendering.",
    "\u201cCEB has never purchased diesel for electricity generation, through competitive bidding including during the tenure of the previous management,\u201d the CEB said in a statement on Friday (18).",
    "\u201cThe new management has not taken any decision against competitive procurement of diesel for electricity generation.\u201d",
    "The CEB said both heavy fuel oil (HFO) and Nephtha will only be bought from the CPC \u201cat a mutually agreed price as there is no other feasible supplier\u201d.",
    "The HFO has accounted for 5.8 percent of the country\u2019s electricity generation in the first nine months, while Nephtha has accounted for 1.9 percent. Diesel has only accounted for 1.1 percent, the CEB said.",
    "\u201cDiesel is the only fuel available for CEB to purchase through competitive bidding, as there are multiple distributors, some of whom have commenced their business recently,\u201d it said.",
    "\u201cCEB does not consider diesel as an economically viable generation option, additionally in the light of Sri Lanka\u2019s emission targets towards transition of cleaner energy.\u201d",
    "\u201cHowever, a minimal use of diesel power plants is required to cater to peak demand, considering the current generation mix and during overhauls/rectification works of other longer power plants.\u201d",
    "\u201cCEB shall ensure competitive bidding procedure in all its business operations.\u201d",
    "The CEB statement comes after many critics in social media blamed President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his government for reportedly cancelling competitive bidding. (Colombo/October 18/2024)"
