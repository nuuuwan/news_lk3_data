    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank bought 142.5 million US dollars from commercial banks in August 2025, taking the total so far this year to 1,238.6 million US dollars so far this year, official data show.",
    "In 2024, the central bank bought 2020.4 million US dollars in the same period with stronger deflationary policy and lower private credit.",
    "In late 2024 the central bank re-started inflationary policy through aggressive open market operations to mis-target the interbank rate, as private credit picked up, leading to sharply reduced collections in November and December.",
    "However, in 2025, there was no inflationary policy per se, other than dollar-rupee buy-sell swaps. Dollar purchases were also unsterilized under the latest phase of the IMF program no longer requiring a sell down of CB held g-secs, which analysts say is a mistake.",
    "If there is no commitment to run deflationary policy, the central bank which is the bank-of-issue in Sri Lanka, will not be able to collect sufficient reserves and may also see the depreciation of its currency if dollars are bought in volumes that exceed deflationary policy.",
    "In 2025, despite record current account surpluses the rupee depreciated, making nonsense of claims made by age-of-inflation macro-economists that current account deficits trigger currency weakness and BOP deficits.",
    "\u201cBlaming current account deficits is a convenient excuse for the macroeconomist to escape accountability and also the International Monetary Fund to dodge accountability for badly designed monetary programs and wrong technical advice,\u201d says EN\u2019s economic columnist Bellwether.",
    "\u201cThat is why some countries like Sri Lanka cannot solve external monetary troubles that began two years after the creation of the central bank. In the first about 18 months of its existence the Central Bank of Ceylon ran deflationary policy.",
    "\u201cThat is why in the latter stages of a 4-year IMF program now some countries miss targets and there are street riots as currencies slide again.\u201d",
    "RELATED : Sri Lanka rupee depreciates amid record current account surplus : analysis",
    "However, the central bank in Sri Lanka is still collecting dollars and keeping the exchange rate broadly stable due to the deflationary effect coming from coupon payments by the government on its bond stock.",
    "Sri Lanka ran into multiple currency crises and eventual default critics say, because the IMF itself helped spread a narrative that was acted upon from 2015 that money printing (monetary easing, there is a statistical \u2018space\u2019 to cut rates, and a statistical \u2018output gap\u2019 can be closed with eased monetary policy etc) would lead to growth by teaching the unfortunate country how to calculate potential output.",
    "Potential output is also incorporated into a new monetary law, which amusingly seems to have been drawn up by macroeconomists themselves on the premise that only re-financing government deficits with printed money is bad and refinancing other credit by macro-economists, is not.",
    "In the latest IMF program \u2013 where there is no commitment to sell down the Treasury bond stock of the central bank \u2013 the agency committed to collect 2.64 billion US dollars between November 2024 to December 2025.",
    "Up to now 1,577 million dollars have been collected \u2013 a part of which have been given to the government through unsterilized sales under a de facto undertaking to provide dollars for fiscal authorities \u2013 leaving around 1,072 million dollars to be collected in the remaining four months of the year or about 250 million dollars a month.",
    "\u201cIn a note issue bank, the contraction of domestic assets, working through its note issue (reserve money) generally called the \u2018reserve pass through\u2019 automatically leads to an increase in foreign assets and vice versa,\u201d Bellwether says.",
    "\u201cThere is no big magic to exchange rates, as classical economists have repeatedly explained to telling effect, before age-of-inflation interventionist dogma.",
    "\u201cPresent day macroeconomists centred around US Saltwater universities in particular have brought back thoroughly debunked Mercantilism as well as statistics (econometrics) into the mainstream of what is now ironically called economics.",
    "\u201cAs a result, there is no accountability for bad money. So the false doctrine and the agency or agencies that spread and act on them will live another day to create more trouble for the poor and slap more taxes on them.\u201d",
    "However, collecting less dollars than expected is not the end of the world because any central bank collection of dollars without currency pressure, represents that full inflationary policy has not yet resumed.",
    "The end of monetary stability comes when inflationary policy resumes and the central bank steadily starts to use monetary reserves to repay debt or finance imports instead of allowing rates to go up.",
    "The IMF\u2019s ARA metric is a completely flawed concept, critics have pointed out.",
    "Monetary reserves \u2013 fx reserves inextricably tied to the base money via interbank liquidity and short term rates \u00a0\u2013 cannot be used prudently for any other purpose than to push rates up through unsterilized sales.",
    "For the purposes of debt repayment only a sinking fund (externally invested for particular debt especially in small countries) or a sovereign wealth fund which is divorced from reserve money can be used.",
    "Ironically before the creation of the American style central bank in 1950, then Ceylon under the British classical economic concepts, had sinking funds and no political policy rate and no political transmission mechanism nor inflation targets that were against the public interest.",
    "Using monetary reserves for third party private imports via a suppressed policy rate is a strict no-no. (Colombo/Aug16/2025)"
