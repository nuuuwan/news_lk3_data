    "The four Houthi boats attacked at around 06:30 Yemeni time (03:30 GMT) with mounted weapons and small arms, getting to within 20m (66ft) of the container ship, which the crew \u201cattempted to board\u201d. The ships crew issued a distress call and a security team returned fire, the statement said.",

    "Maersk said last week that it was preparing to resume journeys through Red Sea - after diverting to the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope because of recent Houthi attacks on shipping.",
    "The Red Sea is one of the world\u2019s most important shipping lanes as it links markets in Europe with Asia.",
