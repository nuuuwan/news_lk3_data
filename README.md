Marshall, a former British police officer, did not specify which local leagues or member nations he was alluding to.

“I am confident that the cricket you watch is safe and clean,” Marshall told ESPN Cricinfo as per PTI.

“But I am also absolutely sure that corruptors are constantly looking for a route into the game, particularly in badly-run lower-level franchise leagues. The threat to the game is corruptors won’t go away while there is always money to be made and they will look for weakness in the system to get in.” he added.

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, Dilith Jayaweera states that his national strategic plan includes a comprehensive plan to revamp the agricultural sector and significantly improve the lives and incomes of farmers.

Addressing a public rally held in Kaduruwela, Jayaweera emphasized the urgent need to address the ongoing struggles faced by farmers. He criticized the current system, which he claims benefits only a small segment of the population while leaving farmers to grapple with persistent hardships.

“Nearly 30 percent of our population is directly involved in agriculture, yet they continue to face severe challenges,” Jayaweera stated. “It is unjust that while only a few benefit, the majority of our farmers suffer. Our goal is to transition these farmers to a more lucrative model, enhancing their income while keeping them within the agricultural sector.”

In this case, the World Health Organization has granted permission to use the vaccine against adults.

The World Health Organization claims that this is a key step in the immune system in Africa and other countries.

The vaccine produced by the Bavarian Nordic A /S is only allowed to be purchased by donors such as Gavi and UNICEF.. Vaccination balance is low because there is only one manufacturer.

The Chief Director of the World Health Organization has demanded that the donors buy the vaccine and immediately distribute the area in need.. (A)

The country is preparing for a presidential election again.

There is no need to underline how confident this is. The fact that this presidential election is being conducted from the frame within the monopoly political system cannot be told.

The fact that the existing democratic system is determined by numbers is subject to common sense.

The president's democratic election, centered on the number of votes, is defined as the influence of the votes of the Eelam Tamil people and other minority ethnic groups.

Candidates contesting the presidential election from the south are decorating the campaign platforms by emphasizing the management of the Sinhala and Buddhist nationalism.

The public had a negative opinion of all leading Presidential candidates, but A.K. Dissanayake had the least negative rating.

In IHP SLOTS polling for August 2024, the net favourability rating of SJB leader Sajith Premadasa improved to -32 (+10 points compared to July). Meanwhile, NPP/JVP leader A.K. Dissanayake and President Ranil Wickremesinghe saw their favourability ratings drop to -21 (-16 points) and -33 (-4 points) respectively. The favourability rating of Namal Rajapaksa, the SLPP Presidential Election candidate, was -89 in August.

### Second preference vote is second round in Presidential election

It may be important to pay attention to the second and third preferences in the current Presidential election, which seems to be a three-way battle

Presidential elections of most major democracies are held using two-round systems. It is a more democratic variant of the one-round first-past-the-post systems. Even in a two-round system, if a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes in the first round, there is no need for a second round. If no one gets more than 50%, only the first and second candidates will qualify for the second round.

Sri Lanka’s presidential election system is a unique one. It seems to be a composite of three systems that are currently used internationally to make the first-past-the-post systems more democratic. The three methods are – Supplementary Vote, Ranked Choice and Two-Round methods. For now, I think it’s more practical for us to think of our system as a variant of a two-round system.

“There was one daily newspaper in the Ivory Coast, at least, only one came my way. It was called Fraternite’ Matin.

The two sugar firms referred to are Pelwatte and Sevenagala sugar factories. They are supposed to carry a stock of 1.3 million litres unable to sell.

He attributes this problem to the economic crisis and tax hikes.

The Sihala Urumaya (SU) was formed in April 2000 on the basis that while Tamils and Muslims demonstrably had political parties to safeguard their interests, the majority community suffered from a lacuna in this regard. But the SU may have conveniently – or cynically – overlooked how the United National Party (UNP) as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) openly catered primarily to the wellbeing of the island’s Sinhalese Buddhists, and arguably shared the dubious honour of pioneering ‘political Buddhism’

### Sri Lanka Lifts Import Restrictions on Motor Vehicles Effective October 1, 2024

The government has announced the lifting of the temporary suspension on motor vehicle imports, effective October 1, 2024. This decision comes after over four years of stringent import restrictions that were initially imposed to safeguard the country’s foreign exchange reserves during the economic crisis.

The import ban, introduced in March 2020, was aimed at curbing the outflow of foreign exchange amidst the country’s deepening economic troubles. With the ban now lifted, Sri Lanka will begin importing motor vehicles again, starting in stages, as part of a broader economic recovery strategy tied to the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
