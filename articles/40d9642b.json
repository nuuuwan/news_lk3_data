    "Chinese Embassy voices support for local law enforcement agencies, emphasising need to crack down on criminals while ensuring their legitimate rights are upheld",
    "Highlights severity of telecom and online fraud, calling it a serious threat to both nations and affects friendship between the countries",
    "Claims they have been working with SL Police and as a result a significant number of suspects were apprehended, with efforts now underway to repatriate and prosecute",
    "China has expressed its commitment to enhancing anti-fraud law enforcement cooperation with Sri Lanka following the arrest of numerous foreign suspects involved in online scams, including several Chinese nationals.",
    "In a statement issued yesterday, the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka voiced its support for local law enforcement agencies, emphasising the need to crack down on criminals while ensuring that their legitimate rights are upheld in accordance with the law.",
    "This comes after the recent arrest of 31 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement in online fraud operations. Sri Lanka Police made the arrests in two separate locations. 16 suspects were apprehended at a hotel in the Aniwatte area of Kandy, and 15 others were detained at an apartment in Ethul Kotte, Welikada. The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) is currently leading investigations into these cases.",
    "In the statement, the Chinese Embassy highlighted the severity of telecom and online fraud, calling it a serious threat to both nations. \u201cThese cases not only endanger the property of our two peoples but also damage China\u2019s international image and affect the traditional friendship between our countries,\u201d it said. China reaffirmed its commitment to aiding Sri Lanka in curbing these crimes, stating: \u201cWe stand ready to strengthen our cooperation in law enforcement to tackle this issue jointly.\u201d",
    "\u201cOnline fraud has been a growing problem in China since it first emerged in the 1990s. Over the years, the Chinese Government has made significant progress in combatting such crimes. In 2021 alone, China saw a fivefold increase in the number of cases solved compared to five years prior. The country has experienced a year-on-year decline in online fraud cases for 17 consecutive months since June 2021, signalling the effectiveness of its countermeasures.\u201d",
    "\u201cGlobally, online and telecom fraud has become a widespread problem, with criminal networks exploiting vulnerabilities in countries with advanced telecommunications infrastructure, like Sri Lanka. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security has been proactive in establishing partnerships with several nations, including Myanmar, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates, to combat fraud. Despite these efforts, many fraud networks have relocated to countries in Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka, where they continue targeting Chinese citizens,\u201d it added.",
    "The Embassy said due to Sri Lanka\u2019s robust telecommunications infrastructure and geographical location, some criminal gangs have set up operations in the country, using it as a base for online scams. \u201cThe Chinese Government, recognising this trend, dispatched a special working group in September to work alongside Sri Lanka Police in a joint operation. As a result, a significant number of suspects were apprehended, with efforts now underway to ensure their repatriation and prosecution,\u201d it noted.",
    "The Chinese Embassy said that this cooperation is just the beginning and stressed the need for continued joint efforts to address the growing threat of online fraud. \u201cIn this age of globalisation, no country can remain insulated from such issues. China and Sri Lanka have long shared a strong friendship and have cooperated across various sectors. We are ready to strengthen our law enforcement collaboration further to protect both our citizens and uphold our nations\u2019 reputations.\u201d",
    "The arrests of Chinese nationals last week underscore the scale of the issue. In just a few days, Sri Lankan authorities detained 129 foreign nationals, including a significant number of Chinese suspects. Among them were 30 Chinese, four Indians, and six Thai nationals arrested from two locations in Hanwella on 6 October, 19 Chinese nationals from Nawala on 7 October, 20 Chinese from Panadura on 10 October, and 120 Chinese from Kundasale on 12 October.",
    "China is hopeful that this enhanced collaboration with Sri Lanka will yield swift and effective results in the fight against online fraud, benefitting the citizens of both nations. The Chinese Embassy urged Sri Lankan authorities, the media, and the general public to support these efforts as both countries work to strengthen their defences against these crimes."
