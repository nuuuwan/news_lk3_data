The company continued this momentum by introducing the nation\u2019s first cashless vending machines, reaffirming its commitment to innovation. Today, CBA stands as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest fintech solution providers, with a vast network of over 50,000 merchants specialising in payment acquiring solutions.

CBA serves over 20,000 customers across more than 100 sub-industries, driving digital transformation across the nation.",
