    "Twitter is imposing a temporary cap on the number of tweets that accounts can see each day, a move that sparked backlash from some users.",
    "Twitter owner Elon Musk tweeted on Saturday that unverified users will be able to view as many as 600 posts daily while Twitter Blue subscribers can see 6,000 posts \u201cto address extreme levels of data scraping\u201d and \u201csystem manipulation.\u201d He later added the limits will be increased to 800 and 8,000 respectively, without specifying how long the limits will last.",
    "About five hours later, Musk revised the limits again, increasing the number to 1,000 for unverified accounts and 10,000 for verified users.",
    "Users started reporting issues accessing the social media site earlier Saturday, after they received notifications that they had exceeded their \u201crate limit.\u201d The number of reports peaked at nearly 7,000 at around 11:30 a.m. in New York before declining, according to\u00a0Downdetector. Following Musk\u2019s announcement on the limits, the site\u2019s trending topics was dominated by complaints, with users posting about \u201c#TwitterDown\u201d and \u201cRIP Twitter.\u201d",
    "The move follows other\u00a0restrictions put in place\u00a0earlier this week, when Twitter stopped users without accounts from viewing tweets and profiles. The procedure, which Musk said was temporary, was enacted to prevent people from scraping the site for data.",
    "Musk has made a series of changes to Twitter since buying the company and stepping in as CEO in 2022, perhaps most notably through the introduction of premium accounts that charge users $8 per month, called Twitter Blue, and the ability for users to create subscriber-only content.(Bloomberg)"
