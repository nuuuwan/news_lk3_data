  "original_body_lines": [
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) MP Dr. Kaushalya Ariyaratne has lodged a formal complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) over a series of malicious and false news posts circulating on social media, including personal attacks targeting her.",
    "In a statement, MP Ariyaratne condemned the deliberate campaign to tarnish her reputation and called for swift action against those responsible for creating and spreading such content. She emphasised that these \u201ccheap tactics\u201d would not deter women from participating in politics nor harm the Government, stating, \u201cIf anyone believes such tricks can intimidate us, they are sorely mistaken. While you resort to petty ploys, we will continue to focus on progress.\u201d",
    "The complaint comes in the wake of a national Sinhala daily newspaper publishing a report about an alleged domestic dispute involving an NPP Colombo district MP and his wife, which also mentioned a fellow female MP. Following this, social media posts falsely alleged that MP Ariyaratne was the female MP referenced in the report. The posts escalated into a vicious online campaign, spreading unfounded accusations and defamatory content about her.",
    "MP Ariyaratne has called on the CID to investigate the orchestrated campaign and take appropriate legal action against those responsible for harming her good name."
