    "A new police unit on election related affairs has reportedly been established at the Police Headquarters with an Officer-In-Charge (OIC) also appointed to lead the relevant unit.",
    "Meanwhile, it was reported that in addition to the Senior Deputy Inspector of Police (SDIG) Asanga Karavita, another DIG and a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) have been assigned to oversee duties related to the upcoming Presidential Election.",
    "Accordingly, DIG P. Liyanage and SSP K.D.G.L.A Dharmasena have been assigned the relevant duties, as per reports.",
    "On Wednesday (24), the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP. The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoon\u2019s appointment as the IGP.",
    "The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon.",
    "However, the Commissioner General of Elections earlier said that the issues pertaining to the IGP post will not affect the holding of elections, as SDIG Asanga Karavita has already been assigned to oversee the election-related duties."
