    "South Korea\u2019s former first lady has been arrested over a string of charges including stock manipulation and bribery.",
    "Kim Keon Hee, 52, denied all charges against her during a court hearing on Tuesday that lasted four hours. The Seoul court issued a warrant to detain her late in the day, citing risks that she may destroy evidence otherwise.",
    "This is the first time in South Korea\u2019s history that a former president and his spouse are in jail at the same time.",
    "Kim\u2019s husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, was detained earlier to face trial over a failed martial law bid last year that plunged the country into political turmoil and eventually led to his ouster.",
    "Prosecutors say Kim, 52, made over 800 million won ($577,940; \u00a3428,000) by participating in a price-rigging scheme involving the stocks of Deutsch Motors, a BMW dealer in South Korea.",
    "While this allegedly happened before her husband was elected the country\u2019s leader, it continued to cast a shadow throughout his presidency.",
    "She allegedly also accepted two Chanel bags and a diamond necklace as bribes from the controversial Unification Church in exchange for business favours.",
    "Among other charges, Kim is also accused of meddling in candidate nominations during the parliamentary by-elections in 2022 and the general elections last year.",
    "Kim appeared solemn as she attended Tuesday\u2019s hearing wearing a black suit and a black skirt.",
    "\u2018I sincerely apologise for causing trouble despite being a person of no importance,\u2019 she told reporters.",
    "While he was president, Yoon vetoed three opposition-led bills that sought a special counsel investigation into allegations against Kim.",
    "He issued the last veto in November, a week before he declared martial law.",
    "A special counsel was set up in June this year after Yoon\u2019s rival Lee Jae Myung became president."
