### Sri Lanka to expand scope of controversial 1970s media control law

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers has decided to amend the country’s Press Council Act to expand scope of controversial 1970s media control law to electronic and online media, the government said.

The Sri Lanka Press Council Act was introduced during Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s government and has long been viewed as a tool for controlling the country’s print media rather than promoting press freedom.

The Act established the Press Council, a statutory body empowered to regulate newspapers, monitor journalistic practices, and enforce restrictions on reporting deemed to threaten national security, public order, or morality.

It gave the Council sweeping powers, including the authority to summon editors, seize publications, and penalize journalists or publishers who violated its provisions.

Critics argue that these provisions enable censorship under the guise of regulation, discouraging critical journalism and undermining the role of the press as a democratic watchdog.
