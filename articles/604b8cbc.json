    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013Sri Lanka\u2019s lower-income households spend 10 percent of their income on value added tax (VAT), while the richest households contribute some 95 percent of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and personal income tax (PIT), the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) said.",
    "Speaking at an event on Tuesday October IPS Research Economist Priyanka Jayawardena noted, however, that tax evasion remains a problem.",
    "While PIT revenue for 2023 was estimated at 131 billion rupees, only 48 billion appears to have been collected in 2023, a statement from the IPS quoted her as saying.",
    "Jayawardena pointed out that VAT revisions \u2013 from 15 percent to 18 percent \u2013 along with removing exemptions have hit the poorest hardest, with the bottom 10 percent of households paying around 10 percent of their income in VAT compared to 6 percent for wealthier households. In contrast, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco are more progressive, with wealthier households paying nearly half of all excise taxes. The wealthiest 20 percent pay nearly half of alcohol (43 percent) and tobacco taxes (44 percent), while the poorest 40 percent contribute less than 20 percent on both. Reforming VAT while increasing excise",
    "taxes was suggested to create a healthier and fairer tax system.",
    "Tuesday\u2019s discussion also touched on the imbalance in welfare benefits. According to IPS, public service pensions (PSP), for instance, overwhelmingly favour wealthier households, with the top 20 percent receiving half of all pension benefits. \u201cThe bottom 40 percent only gets 11 percent of these benefits,\u201d Jayawardena said, suggesting a gradual shift to a contributory pension scheme to reduce the fiscal burden and ensure long-term sustainability.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a visiting team of International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials last week that his government plans to provide income and VAT relief to people who are struggling.",
    "There is, however, a school of thought that a targeted VAT increase is preferable and, perhaps counterintuitively, more beneficial to the poor and vulnerable than a hike in income tax.",
