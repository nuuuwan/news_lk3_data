### Sri Lanka BOP surplus to June 2024 running slightly behind last year

ECONONYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s balance of payments is still strongly in surplus in 2024 under the current interest rate structure, but is running slightly behind 2023, official data show.

Sri Lanka had recorded a BOP surplus (as defined) of 1,761 million US dollars by June 2024, down from 1,957.6 million dollars a year earlier.

Broadly, the BOP surplus is an improvement in net international reserves, and is a reliable figure unlike numbers like ‘current account’ balances which can be subject to large errors.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has run deflationary policy to collect reserves.

Under IMF programs, a central bank is able to collect reserves soon after hiking rates and contracting domestic credit, but misses reserve targets as the economy recovers and a narrow call money rate is targeted with excess liquidity on mathematical formulae (real interest rates or growth), critics have said.

*2024-08-09 06:07:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Adapting-concepts-of-Islamic-Finance-to-an-effective-debt-restructuring-mechanism/4-765311) · `en`

Islamic Finance (IF) is based on the Shariah principles which are interpreted via Quran and Sunnah. It is operated currently globally not only in Muslim countries, in other Western and Eastern countries which are based on conventional banking principles. Hence, it is imperative to analyse how the IF can be adopted as a global financial system in order to address most of the current economic hazards in the world.

In Islam, it highly considers that the resources are needed to fulfil the material requirements of both individual and society. The high concern and knowledge on these ethical principles are directed to the personal and societal justice and tranquillity which is the way to the fair financial system. Especially, in the event of handling the distressed customers in the financial institutions, the principles of IF can be successfully adapted.

It seems like you've shared a comprehensive overview of the evolution of warfare, focusing on armored vehicles, drones, and the strategic shifts that have occurred over time. This narrative spans several decades, highlighting key moments such as the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, the US military's concept of "air war," the role of drones in modern conflicts, and the recent developments in Ukraine.



Your account underscores the significant technological advancements and strategic adaptations that have shaped contemporary warfare. It also touches upon the geopolitical implications of these changes, such as the reliance on industrial strength and the role of alliances like NATO in supporting military efforts.



Given the complexity and breadth of the topics covered, do you have any specific questions or aspects you'd like to delve deeper into? Whether it's the impact of drone technology, the evolution of armored vehicle tactics, or the influence of industrial capacity on military strategy, I'm here to assist further.

In the north, the Russians made good progress until they reached the Ukrainian capital, Kiiv, where the air force tried to capture the Antonov Airport. Here, the strong Ukrainian resistance stopped them in their ways and eventually pushed them backwards.

In the south, the Russian forces attacked the port of Mary, as the Russians were deeply infiltrated and crossed the Dinipper River, crossing the Dinipper River before they were stopped by high forces outside Mikola.
