    "App\u00e9 Lanka Founder Shaan Corea (left) with Commonwealth Union President and Presidential Envoy of Sri Lanka (2022-2024) Nirj Deva",
    "Commonwealth Union Ltd., has announced its partnership with the App\u00e9 Lanka Foundation, a rural development initiative focused on transforming the Poonakary region in Northern Sri Lanka.",
    "For the past eight years, App\u00e9 Lanka has made significant strides in improving local livelihoods and infrastructure, driven by a commitment to sustainability, empowerment, and unity. This partnership is a testament to Commonwealth Union\u2019s dedication to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), supporting social impact without any financial gain. The goal is simple \u2014 to make a lasting, positive difference in these communities.",
    "App\u00e9 Lanka\u2019s journey began when its founder, Shaan Corea, visited Poonakary and witnessed the daily struggles of its people \u2014 women walking miles to fetch water, farmers battling dry lands, and a community recovering from decades of conflict. The foundation\u2019s first initiative addressed the region\u2019s water crisis, installing Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants to provide clean, safe drinking water.",
    "The foundation\u2019s holistic approach \u2014 addressing water security, education, food security nutrition, and reconciliation, demonstrates the power of collaboration in transforming underprivileged communities. From installing water purification plants to organising sports and arts events for children, App\u00e9 Lanka\u2019s work is an inspiring example of the profound impact that compassionate, grassroots initiatives can have on regional development.",
    "App\u00e9 Lanka, is a development project focused on empowering divisions in Northern Sri Lanka, starting with Poonakary, a region heavily impacted by a 30-year war. The project targets sustainable initiatives such as providing renewable energy through solar systems, benefiting 28 homes so far, with plans for 1,000 more.",
    "App\u00e9 Lanka also addresses transportation, having distributed bicycles to school children to prevent dropouts and increase attendance. In promoting peace and reconciliation, the project has conducted various workshops, such as \u2018Music for Unity,\u2019 \u2018Arts for Unity,\u2019 and \u2018Sports for Unity,\u2019 and has organized exchange programs in both Poonakary and Colombo. Each year, students in the region are also given a year's supply of exercise books to further their education and discourage absenteeism. Additionally, App\u00e9 Lanka focuses on livelihood development, to create sustainable employment for women and women-headed households. To tackle water shortages, 30 schools now have water purifying systems, with more installations planned."
