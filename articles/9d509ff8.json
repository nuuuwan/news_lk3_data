    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has issued an Extraordinary Gazette notification summoning the newly elected Tenth Parliament to convene at 10:00 a.m. on 21 November.",
    "This announcement follows the General Election scheduled for 14 November, where 225 Members of Parliament will be chosen\u2014196 through direct public vote and 29 from the national list.",
    "The inaugural session, set to be a momentous occasion, will see the commencement of the 10th Parliament\u2019s legislative duties. On the first day, special protocols will be followed. Members will have the freedom to sit in any seat as there will be no assigned seating.",
    "The Secretary-General of Parliament will open the session by presenting the Gazette notification that formally establishes the date and time for the Parliamentary convening.",
    "Following this, Members will elect the Speaker, marking the first major task for the new Parliament. Any Member of Parliament is eligible to become the Speaker, provided they accept the nomination.",
    "The process involves proposing candidates, conducting a vote if necessary, and a tradition where the chosen Speaker is escorted to the chair by two Members. If multiple nominations are made, a secret ballot is conducted, with the Secretary-General overseeing the vote and tallying results at the Parliament\u2019s Table.",
    "In cases where no candidate achieves a majority, rounds of elimination voting will occur until a candidate wins an absolute majority. Should votes be tied, the Secretary-General has the authority to draw lots to determine the Speaker.",
    "After electing the Speaker, Members will take their official oath, followed by the election of the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees. Once these positions are filled, the inaugural session will typically adjourn, setting the stage for future legislative sessions.",
    "The proceedings may extend if the President delivers a Government policy statement under Article 33 of the Constitution. If so, the session will be temporarily suspended and then reconvened for the President\u2019s address.",
    "This first gathering not only initiates the legislative process for the Tenth Parliament but also underscores Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to maintaining procedural rigour as its Government embarks on its new term."
