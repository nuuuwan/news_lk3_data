### #SriPOP - The Sound of a New Sri Lanka

In Stein Studios, in the outskirts of Colombo, a dancer moves as if the earth itself is breathing beneath her feet.

It’s human — imperfectly perfect, like the heartbeat that drives it. A drum echoes, a synth sighs, and something ancient awakens.

It’s not a beat born in a studio, nor a formula cooked up for virality.

It’s a call — a return — to the rhythm that has always pulsed through this island’s soul.

To understand #SriPop, you have to first understand the strange, beautiful chaos of Sri Lanka’s musical DNA.

From the Portuguese-inspired baila that once drifted through coastal taverns, to the rabana circles of rural women who drum while they laugh and sing, to the Nada Bhera & Yak Bera— the ceremonial drumming that summons gods and courage alike — this island’s music has never been entertainment alone. It has always been spiritual architecture, a way of being, of remembering, of belonging.

Japan’s ruling party picked conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi as its new head on Saturday, putting her on course to become the country’s first female prime minister.

A vote in parliament to choose a prime minister to replace Shigeru Ishiba is expected to be held on October 15.

The new LDP president is likely to succeed Shigeru Ishiba as leader of the world’s fourth-biggest economy because the party, which has governed Japan for almost all the postwar period, is the biggest in parliament. But this is not assured as the party and its coalition partner lost their majorities in both houses under Ishiba in the past year.
