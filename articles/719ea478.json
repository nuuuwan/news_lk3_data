  "original_title": "ITAK Jaffna Parliamentarian MA  Sumanthiran  the only Opposition MP to Participate in IMF Proposals Review Meeting for Opposition Leaders; Raises Concerns Over Lack of Transparency and absence of published technical assistance reports from the IMF regarding several recommendations",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M. A. Sumanthiran stood as the only Opposition member in attendance at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposals review meeting for opposition party leaders held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.",
    "Despite President Ranil Wickremesinghe extending invitations to the opposition including the main Opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the majority declined to attend.",
    "Speaking to Daily FT after attending the meeting, Sumanthiran said he took the opportunity to address various concerns regarding the IMF proposals at the discussion, notably focusing on the issue of transparency.",
    "Specifically, the TNA MP said he highlighted the absence of published technical assistance reports from the IMF regarding several recommendations of concern.",
    "Sumanthiran noted that while the IMF cited the need for Government approval to publicise the reports, the Government, during the meeting, expressed no objections and offered to provide these technical assistance reports to MPs for their examination.",
    "\u201cWe cannot determine our support for the program until we have clarity on these issues. Several of the recommendations raise scepticism. For instance, some analyses claim that increasing the withholding tax which would have targeted actual income earners would have generated the same revenue as the 18% VAT increase which targeted everyone. Therefore, without a comprehensive analysis explaining why certain actions were chosen over others, we are unable to provide our assessment.",
    "We need to thoroughly examine the situation before making any comments,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP further highlighted that the Government acknowledged its failure to complete approximately 15 tasks outlined by the IMF, originally scheduled for completion by February 2024.",
    "\u201cI addressed this concern as well. The Government acknowledged the delay in meeting the target within the stipulated time frame and has requested an extension from the IMF, which has been granted. They assured that they will fulfil their commitments and complete the tasks,\u201d the MP added.",
    "Issuing a press statement, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said the President had convened the crucial party leader\u2019s meeting \u201cin a proactive move towards transparency and collaboration.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe meeting saw the active participation of various stakeholders, including TNA Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran, underscoring the government\u2019s commitment to inclusive decision-making,\u201d the PMD said.",
    "It added that during the meeting Secretary to the Treasury Mahinda Siriwardena provided insights into the ongoing negotiations with bilateral creditors, commercial creditors, and ISBs, with an outlook towards completing the process by the end of June this year.",
    "\u201cFurthermore, the Central Bank Governor highlighted the government\u2019s efforts in adhering to the recommendations outlined in the governor\u2019s diagnostic report, emphasising the commitment to a structured roadmap for implementation. President Wickremesinghe affirmed the government\u2019s willingness to make these technical assistance reports available to the members of parliament and invited Sumanthiran and other Opposition members to attend a meeting and engage with the IMF to further discuss the proposals,\u201d it said.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardane, Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha, State Ministers of Finance Shehan Semasinghe and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, and Secretary to the Treasury Mahinda Siriwariwardena represented the Government at the meeting while the opposition was represented by TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran.",
    "Leader of the SJB and Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa declined the invitation to attend, citing disingenuousness and lack of good faith in the invitation.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s office last week said that Premadasa, National People\u2019s Power leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and ITAK\u2019s Sivagnanam Sritharan were invited to attend the meeting."
