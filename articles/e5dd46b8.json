    "It is with profound sorrow that I pen these words, marking the passing of a remarkable Buddhist leader who has served the Buddha Sasana and numerous communities in Sri Lanka and beyond. I had the fortune of meeting him more than three decades ago. Throughout this journey, he has been a true Kalyana Mitta, nurturing our spiritual paths.",
    "The bond between myself and the Venerable Dr. Galboda Gnanissara Thero, Chief Incumbent of Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo, has flourished, rooted in mutual respect and shared devotion. As a true Kalyana Mitta, a spiritual friend, he has not only walked alongside me, but has also illuminated my path with wisdom and compassion.",
    "Ven. Gnanissara Thero transformed and nurtured Hunupitiye Gangaramaya Temple into a cornerstone of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

    "The youth unrest of 1971 marked a pivotal moment for Ven. Gnanissara Thero. Recognizing unemployment and lack of opportunities as root causes, he established the Sri Jinaratana Adhyapana Ayathana Palaka Sabha, aiming to empower school dropouts through skill development and self-employment.",
    "Today, the Sri Jinaratana Training Institute, serving over 500 learners daily, stands as a testament to his vision. The institute emphasizes discipline and commitment, with fines for unjustified absences supporting charitable endeavours.",

    "Ven. Gnanissara Thero\u2019s philanthropic endeavours included the establishment of Karavile village in Sella Kataragama, exemplifying his commitment to sustainable community development. His efforts in rehabilitating the devastated Seenigama village following the tsunami tragedy underscore his unwavering dedication to rebuilding lives and restoring hope in times of adversity\u2014a mission I was fortunate to join.",
    "The Suhada Home for disabled children in Sri Lanka, initiated by Ven. Gnanissara Thero, inspired me to establish the Metta Welfare Association in 1994. This organization in Singapore alleviates suffering and addresses the social needs of the marginalized.",
    "Guided by the Buddha\u2019s words, \u201cCaratha bhikkave carikan, Bahujana hitaya, bahujana sukhaya\u201d (\u201cGo on walk, monks, for the happiness and well-being of all beings\u201d), Ven.
