    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The family of murdered Sri Lanka journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge appealed on Tuesday to the island\u2019s new president to reopen an investigation into the internationally-condemned assassination.",
    "The anti-establishment editor was murdered as he drove to work in January 2009 by attackers later identified by police as members of a military intelligence unit linked to the once-powerful Rajapaksa family.",
    "Saturday\u2019s election of the country\u2019s first leftist president, Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, had given the family \u201ca renewed sense of hope\u201d of justice, Wickrematunge\u2019s daughter Ahimsa said.",
    "\u201cWe are hopeful that this leadership will bring a fresh perspective into finally addressing the atrocities that have taken place in Sri Lanka\u2019s recent human rights history,\u201d she said in a statement.",
    "Wickrematunge had accused then defence ministry secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa of taking kickbacks in arms procurements, including the purchase of second-hand MiG jet fighters from Ukraine.",
    "His family held Rajapaksa, who was at the time a US national, responsible for the killing and filed action in a California court, but it was put on hold after he acquired immunity when he became president in November 2019.",
    "Rajapaksa was forced out of office in July 2022 after mobs stormed his residence following months of shortages of food and other essentials.",
    "His successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, did not reopen investigations into any of the Rajapaksa-era killings, including those of over a dozen journalists and media workers.",
    "Wickrematunge, a prominent critic of the then administration, was stabbed days before he was due to testify in a corruption case involving Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "The killing shone a light on human rights violations in Sri Lanka under president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya\u2019s elder brother.",
    "Wickrematunge case has been seen as emblematic of the island\u2019s culture of impunity for rights violations and has been taken up repeatedly by the UN rights body and others.",
    "Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been accused of giving orders to a shadowy military outfit allegedly involved in murdering journalists and political dissidents during Sri Lanka\u2019s long-running civil war, an allegation he denies."
