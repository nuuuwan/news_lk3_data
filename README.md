### அரச நிறுவனங்களை சைபர் தாக்குதலிலிருந்து பாதுகாப்பதற்கு விசேட திட்டம் அறிமுகம்

*2024-12-28 14:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202370) · `ta`

அரச நிறுவனங்களை சைபர் தாக்குதல் அச்சுறுத்தல்களிலிருந்து பாதுகாப்பதற்காக, அரச ஊழியர்களிடையே சைபர் பாதுகாப்பு விழிப்புணர்வை மேம்படுத்துவதற்கான திட்டங்களை இலங்கை கணினி அவசரகால பதிலளிப்பு குழு வெளியிட்டுள்ளது.

அரசாங்க வலைத்தளங்கள் மற்றும் கணினி அமைப்புகளை குறிவைத்து நடத்தப்படும் சைபர் தாக்குதல்களால் ஏற்படும் தொடர்ச்சியான அபாயங்களை தவிர்க்க வேண்டியுள்ளது. அத்துடன் தாக்குதலுக்கு உள்ளான கட்டமைப்புகளை மீட்டெடுப்பது கணிசமான வருடாந்த செலவுகள் அதிகரிப்பதற்கு காரணமாகின்றது. இதனால் பொதுமக்கள் நிதி கணிசமாக வீணாகின்றது.

ஆகவே அரச நிறுவனங்கள் முழுவதும் சைபர் பாதுகாப்பை வலுப்படுத்த ஒரு விரிவான உத்தி உருவாக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. இந்தத் திட்டத்தின் முக்கிய அம்சம், அரச ஊழியர்களின் டிஜிட்டல் கல்வியறிவை மேம்படுத்துதல், சைபர் அச்சுறுத்தல்களை திறம்படக் குறைப்பதற்கான அறிவு மற்றும் திறன்களுடன் அவர்களைச் வலுவூட்டல் என்பனவாகும்.

### பண்டிகைக் காலங்களில் கொழும்பில்  குவியும் குப்பைகள்

*2024-12-28 14:01:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202362) · `ta`

வழமையாக நாளாந்தம் 450 தொன் குப்பைகள் அகற்றப்படும். இது இம்மாத இறுதிக்குள் 500 தொன்களாக அதிகரிக்கும் என எதிர்பார்க்கப்படுவதாக கொழும்பு மாநகர ஆணையாளர் பாலித நாணயக்கார தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

கொழும்பில் நாளாந்தம் சாதாரணமாக 420 தொடக்கம் 450 தொன் குப்பைகள் அகற்றப்படுகின்ற நிலையில், பண்டிகைக் காலத்தில் குப்பைகள் சிறிதளவு அதிகரித்துள்ளதாக மேலும் குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.

கொழும்புக்கு டிசம்பர் மாதம் 31 ஆம் திகதிக்குள் அதிகளவானவர்கள்  வருகை தருவதால் இந்தத் தொகை சுமார் 500 தொன்களாக அதிகரிக்காலாம் என கணித்துள்ளோம் என அவர் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

இதேவேளை, அதிகளவான உணவுப்பொருட்கள் வீசப்படுவதனால் மக்கும் கழிவுகளின் அளவு அதிகரிப்பதற்கு வழிவகுத்துள்ளதாக மத்திய சுற்றாடல் அதிகார சபையின் பணிப்பாளர் அஜித் குணவர்தன தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

*2024-12-28 13:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202364) · `ta`

கடந்த மூன்று மாதங்களில் 28 துப்பாக்கிச் சூட்டுச் சம்பவங்கள் நிகழ்ந்துள்ள நிலையில் அவற்றில் 16 சம்பவங்கள் ஒழுங்கமைக்கப்பட்ட குற்றக் குழுக்களால் நடத்தப்பட்டவை என்று பொலிஸ் ஊடகப் பேச்சாளர் பொலிஸ் அத்தியட்சகர் சட்டத்தரணி புத்திக மனதுங்க தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

ஒழுங்கமைக்கப்பட்ட குற்றக் குழுக்களால் நடத்தப்பட்ட தாக்குதல்களில் 10 சம்பவங்கள் குறித்து 57 சந்தேக நபர்களை கைது செய்துள்ளதோடு மூன்று துப்பாக்கிகளை மீட்டுள்ளதாகவும் அவர் குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.

பாதாள உலகக் குழுக்கள் ஒன்றுக்கொன்று அடிக்கடி மோதிக் கொள்கின்றன. அந்த மோதல்களின் தொடர்கின்றமை கவலைக்குரிய விடயமாகும்.

2023 மற்றும் 2024 ஆம் ஆண்டுகளில் நடந்த துப்பாக்கிச் சூட்டுச் சம்பவங்களை ஒப்பிடும் போது, 2024இல் சிறியளவில் குறைவு காணப்படுகிறது.

2023ஆம் ஆண்டில் 120 துப்பாக்கிச் சூட்டுச் சம்பவங்கள் நடைபெற்றுள்ளதோடு அவற்றில் 65 சம்பவங்கள் ஒழுங்கமைக்கப்பட்ட குற்றக்குழுக்களால் நடத்தப்பட்டுள்ளன. 2024 ஆம் ஆண்டில், அந்த எண்ணிக்கை 99ஆக உள்ளது, இச்சம்பவங்களில் 55 குற்றக் கும்பல்கள் ஈடுபட்டுள்ளன.

### Sri Lanka’s economic recovery must be coupled with India’s growth - Ranil

Combining Sri Lanka’s economic recovery with India’s “sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement” will “establish” larger markets for the island country and give it a path away from debt-fuelled growth of the last two decades, according to former president Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“The 2024 statement (India-Sri Lanka joint statement issued this month during island President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s visit) is explicit on moving Sri Lanka away from a debt-driven economic model,” Wickremesinghe said Friday at the 7th Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture organised by India Foundation at India Habitat Centre in New Delhi.

“For two decades, Sri Lanka’s economy has relied heavily on excessive debts, culminating in bankruptcy and an economic meltdown.

Therefore, the strategy in this statement is to enhance Sri Lanka’s economic development by coupling our economic recovery with India’s sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement,” he added.

ECONOMYNEXT – Helmut Schlesinger, who retired from Deutsche Bank 1993 as its President after helping keep Germany stable with the strong Deutsche Mark, standing against mainstream Saltwater-Cambridge inflationism that rocked the rest of the world, has passed away.

Schlesinger’s passing comes as Germany is experiencing the highest inflation and social unrest since the Great Inflation period under the Euro, and early elections have been called after the collapse of a coalition government and calls to re-establish the Deutsche Mark.

In 1952 Schlesinger had joined Bank deutscher Länder, the predecessor agency set up to issue to run Deutsche Mark and served the agency in different capacities maintaining monetary stability when the Fed fired global inflation to promote ‘full employment’.

### Elephants, Monkeys & Kidneys

*2024-12-28 09:11:05* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/elephants-monkeys-kidneys/) · `en`

I have chosen this seemingly peculiar title for the reason that each summarizes the plight of our farmers, unresolved challenges that warrant greater attention of politicians, administrators and researchers. These are real and urgent problems.

All three share the common feature that easy solutions remain elusive and most likely to involve a number of causes and disciplines (multifactorial) and thus a simple or single solution is unlikely.

Farmers are the most affected by elephant and CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Aetiology), while the monkey menace troubles urban communities as well. All three are not new, but have come into prominence lately. The economic consequences are very clear. The helplessness of the victims is pathetic.

### Russia may be responsible for downed Azerbaijani plane, says US

*2024-12-28 08:56:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104533/russia-may-be-responsible-for-downed-azerbaijani-plane-says-us) · `en`

White House spokesman John Kirby has said the US has seen “early indications” that Russia may have been responsible for the downing of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed on 25 December, killing 38 people.

Mr Kirby did not elaborate further, but told reporters the US had offered assistance to the investigation into the crash.

The plane is thought to have come under fire from Russian air defence systems as it tried to land in Chechnya before being diverted across the Caspian Sea to Kazakhstan, where it crashed.

The Kremlin has refused to comment, but the head of Russia’s civil aviation agency said the situation in Chechnya was “very complicated” due to Ukrainian drone strikes on the region.

Mr Kirby said the indications the US had seen went beyond widely circulated photos of the damaged plane, the Washington Post reported.

### Kilinochchi journalist attack suspected retaliation for drug-trade exposé

Kilinochchi-based journalist Murukaiah Thamilchelvan, who narrowly escaped an attempted abduction by a group on Thursday, said that he believes the incident, along with the assault on him, was linked to his ongoing coverage of illicit drug-related issues in the area.

“While returning home on my motorcycle, a cab blocked my path, and its occupants tried to drag me into the vehicle. I managed to escape, but two individuals from the cab severely beat me. I suspect this attack is linked to my reporting on drug-related issues,” he said.

The incident reportedly took place along the A9 road near the Sri Lanka Telecom building in Kilinochchi.

Speaking to the Daily FT, Thamilchelvan said that he could identify one of the attackers, who is believed to have ties to the illicit drug trade in the area.

The journalist received treatment at the Kilinochchi Hospital for injuries sustained in the attack, and the police have recorded his statement.
