### My Wedding, my father’s funeral and a portrait of Mr. Bandaranaike

*2024-10-20 01:51:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-wedding-my-fathers-funeral-and-a-portrait-of-mr-bandaranaike/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Render unto Caesar – Memoirs of Bradman Weerakoon)

Two highly personal life-defining events occurred in 1956. One was my marriage in August to Damayanthi and the other the death of my father in late September.

Damayanthi Gunasekera was the third daughter of a friend of my father’s who joined the colonial police at about the same time as Station House Officers. They both served for 35 years before retiring as superintendent in charge of districts. But more than that, Damayanthi’s mother was a Weerakoon from the same village as my father – Payagala in the Kalutara district – and a second or third cousin as well.

Damayanthi’s mother who wed at the age of 14 was said to be a beauty and it was rumoured in family circles that my father. as a young police officer, was seriously interested in her. Be that as it may my parents were really pleased when the proposal from the Gunasekera side came along.

### Real estate deals in the UK including buying a house that once belonged to Margaret Thatcher

(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: A Maverick with a Midas touch, biography of Nahil Wijesuriya)

Nahil and the family moved to London and Nahil decided to continue staying in the UK, living at College Gardens in Dulwich. The children were 10 and 12 years old and the family enjoyed living here.The real estate market in the UK was at an interesting paradigm. The regulations for rates were based on the square footage of a property with the taxable rate being any area above five square feet.

The basement areas under the regulated height were used for storage, considering this space was not taxable. Over the years the rules changed with taxes based on the regions etc. Nahil took advantage of the changes in tax regulations, adding an extra floor by digging into the basement of his property up to foundation level, creating a seven-foot basement which was the regular height and space, equivalent to an extra floor thus adding more value to his property.

As General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH), I led a diverse team of departmental heads. Some had been with the hotel for decades and held traditional views, while others were more adaptable to new trends. Among them was Executive Chef Publis Silva, who had worked at MLH since 1956, starting at the lowest level in the kitchen. Though rooted in tradition, Chef Publis had a flexible, collaborative approach and an unmatched work ethic. Leading his brigade of 80 chefs with distinction, he earned the respect of everyone. When the Chairman of the company, Sanath Ukwatte, decided to reward ‘The Manager of the Year,’ I recommended Chef Publis for the honour. It was awarded to him, with a car as the prize, a testament to his leadership.

### My clash with Philip Gunawardene in the parliament restaurant

*2024-10-20 01:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-clash-with-philip-gunawardene-in-the-parliament-restaurant/) · `en`

In early 1958, I was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Agrarian Services Department, in charge of implementing the Paddy Lands Act of 1958, under the general direction of the Commissioner. As an officer of the CCS I already had some training and experience in law and administration as well as experience in wet and dry zone agriculture and irrigation.

In setting out to draft the Administrative Regulations under the Act, I came across a number of structural, legal and operational considerations, which probably had not been foreseen by its authors – probably because this was the first time it was being looked at by an administrator with field experience.

### Deep State – Sow a Wind and Reap a Whirlwind

*2024-10-20 01:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/deep-state-sow-a-wind-and-reap-a-whirlwind/) · `en`

“If they did prosper and increase in riches, yet they should not long enjoy them themselves, but be pillaged and spoiled of them” Hosea 8:7

The above is quoted from the Bible and is self-explanatory. Since, the concept of Deep State in Sri Lanka is closely connected, to the Easter Bombing, the Bible verse has been referred to due to its significance.

For the first time in Sri Lanka, Deep State has been discussed publicly, by Sunanda Deshapriya, writing about it in his recent book about the Easter Attack. His book is about the fourth publication on the Easter Sunday attack. I have always had great respect for Sunanda as I had been reading his articles from the nineties.

Although I still have not read this book, skimming through it I think it is well researched. He refers to Deep State as ‘Paaraa Rajya’ in Sinhala. Attorney Kishali Pinto Jayawardena too has written about the danger of Deep State in her articles.

### Kumar David: Left Intellectual, Friend, Rascal

Much will be written in the coming days about the much-loved Kumar David— electrical engineer, brilliant academic, Left intellectual, and writer who passed away on Monday in Los Angeles. Others will write about his academic achievements, his contribution to the Sri Lankan Left, his writings, etc. My short piece is more anecdotal. Kumar had been unwell for some time. In his last email to me on 14 August, he wrote: ‘I am still in LA. Health not too good. Hope to be in SL early 2025 if my health improves.’ Irrepressible as he always was, he added: ‘I understand that you are conning the poor b….s in Papua New Guinea or some such place on Constitutional matters.’

### Father and Daughter – unique persons

*2024-10-20 00:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/father-and-daughter-unique-persons/) · `en`

In my last Sunday’s (October 6) article The Reality of the Present and Memories of the Past, I wrote about a young Tamil Australian from western Sydney – S Shakthidharan – whose play Counting and Cracking has been a resounding success in Australia and more recently in New York. I knew who’s who he was but did not wish to mention his family, except for the one fact that he is a great grandson of C Suntheralingam, a colossus of his time. This reticence since I had not got permission from a family member to mention them.

Memories of a grandaunt of the playwright whom I befriended and admired very much kept twirling in my mind. The memories needed exposure through writing. Hence I wrote to her son Architect C Anjalendran for permission to write about her; permission kindly given. I suppose he could not refuse old me though he shies away from publicity. Thus I mean to dedicate this article to my friend Vatha and mention her father, both truly unique persons.

### RUNNING SCARED?

Never in our recent political history has there been such a simultaneous exodus of political stalwarts, declaring their intent to retire from politics. This is akin to the story of Noah’s Ark, where the threat of imminent disaster, ignited an escape, spurred by a natural existential threat.

Why this sudden realization of the point at which the certainty of age-related decadence, overtakes the myth of the limitless benefit of experience? There has to be something more. Some of these suddenly awakened denizens, may be smelling a so far suppressed and cocooned, visitation by justice as the consequence of moral default and sustained larceny.
