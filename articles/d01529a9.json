    "\u201cI am not running for the Presidential Election under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket but from another alliance. As of now, no one in the Cabinet who is associated with the SLPP has declared their candidacy. Therefore, both the President and I will be contesting from different political parties. After discussing this with the President, I decided to step down from my ministerial position to run in the upcoming Presidential Election,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Last week, Rajapakshe officially declared his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential Election. He said he decided to come forward as a candidate for the victory of Sri Lanka and its people. It is believed he is seeking candidacy under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ticket.",
