    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank and the Employment Provident Fund will commit an \u2018enormity\u2019 in re-structuring fund assets without members\u2019 consent, amid a history of mis-disclosed data and questionable investments, legislators told parliament.",
    "Sri Lanka last week disclosed a plan to meet International Monetary Fund ceilings on borrowings and debt rollovers (Gross Financing Need), by extending the maturities of central bank and EPF held government securities.",
    "Bond re-structuring was earlier promised to be voluntary, but authorities said funds that do not exchange bonds will be charged a 30 percent tax instead of 14 percent. Consenting to the re-structure would boost returns.",
    "The EPF is managed by Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank, which in legal terms is its Monetary Board.",
    "\u201cIt is absolutely false when you say that this is a voluntary participation,\u201d opposition legislator M A Sumanthiran told parliament, in a debate on the debt plan which was passed with 122 voting in \u00a0favour and 62 against.",
    "\u201cThe EPF Act says the custodian in the Monetary board. \u00a0I want to ask them.",
    "\u201cAre you being responsible custodians and making this decision on behalf of 2.5 million members, working class members of the EPF?\u201d",
    "The formal offer is to be made after the passage of the plan in parliament, and which will close on July 25.",
    "On Friday the Superintendent of the EPF had told the parliament\u2019s committee on Public Finance that they had no knowledge of the plan and he saw it on facebook, Sumanthiran said.",
    "\u201cThat is the extent to which this enormous, this onerous responsibility cast, is being exercised,\u201d Sumanthiran said.",
    "\u201cWe heard one member of the monetary board say, \u2018This is an important thing, this is a very serious thing, all of us will be dragged and hanged for doing this\u2019.",
    "\u201cAnd I want to put them on notice, that is what will happen to them, if they dare take this decision or participate in this debt restructuring exercise without consulting the membership.",
    "The EPF is to get 12 bonds in return for its current portfolio, which will pay 12 percent up to 2025 and 9 percent till 2038. The bond will mature from 2027 onward to market rates.",
    "Opposition legislator Harsha de Silva, who chairs the Committee on Public Finance, which approved the debt plan with a majority vote also questioned the lack of consent.",
    "\u201cWho will decide whether to agree to this proposal or not?\u201d de Silva asked. \u201cWe all know that there is no representative of members in the management board of the EPF.",
    "\u201cThough there are 2.5 million members, at least a trade union leader or one representative of the members are not there.\u201d",
    "Sumanthiran said the membership could be consulted through a survey.",
    "\u201cIf it is to be voluntary, it must necessarily have the consent or at least some views of the membership,\u201d Sumanthiran said.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t lie to the country. don\u2019t lie to the people. that they are voluntarily participating in this matter.\u201d",
    "Sovereign bonds now have covenants built into their contracts through \u2018collective action clauses\u2019 allowing for restructuring, after the practice was adopted in the late 1980s amid an epidemic of \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019 (soft-peg) collapses in Latin America and Eastern Europe.",
    "Authorities are walking a tight rope to meet GFN targets, which the IMF claims are required to make the country\u2019s debt \u2018sustainable\u2019 without de-stabilizing the banking system and harming bank deposits.",
    "There have been criticisms that EPF funds were being mis-used for financial repression by economic bureaucrats running the central bank and the Treasury to further their ideology of suppressing market interest rates.",
    "In recent years questions have been raised over the EPF\u2019s link to a so-called bond scam in 2015 and 2016 as well as questionable purchases of stocks at high prices around 2011.",
    "Legislator Kabir Hashim said the EPF had also bought shares of Grain Elevators and Laugfs which had led to losses.",
    "The EPF also bought SriLankan Airlines shares when Emirates was forced out which has since made losses and invested in Canwill Holdings.",
    "EPF does not publish its annual reports on time and at one time it was six years late, Sumanthiran said.",
    "In their financial statements a \u2018serious misrepresentation\u2019 had been made, Sumanthiran claimed in parliament.",
    "According to the EPF\u2019s governing law, each investment should be disclosed at their face value, purchase price and market value of each of the investments he said.",
    "\u201cBut in their financial statements, they say the law requires us to publish the face value, purchase price, market value of each type of investment,\u201d Sumanthiran said.",
    "\u201cThey have changed. It is a false statement of what the law requires them to do. When the question was asked they had no answer to give.\u201d",
    "\u201cIs this the body that can be trusted to be a proper custodian?. And we have a history of the EPF. Through bond scams, through various methods, the EPF has been eaten into.\u201d",
    "Sumanthiran was speaking immediately after the speech of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunewardene.",
    "\u201cAll these platitudes from the Honourable Prime Minister falls flat on their face. \u00a0It is always the EPF and ETF that you have dipped into. Because they are voiceless. They are working class and it is easy for you to do this. And you do not give them a voice.",
    "\u201cYou appoint the central bank, the Monetary Board, to be the custodian, to make decisions on their behalf.",
    "\u201cThis restructuring plan is theirs. This restructuring plan comes from the Treasury and central bank. The very same people make decisions on behalf of the EPF.\u201d (Colombo/July02/2023)"
