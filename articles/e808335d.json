    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Moody\u2019s Investors\u2019 Service, said it was provisionally rating Sri Lanka\u2019s bonds to be exchanged for defaulted securities as \u2018Caa1\u2019 and has put the \u2018Ca\u2019 national rating on watch for upgrade.",
    "Sri Lanka announced a bond exchange which it plans to complete on December 12.",
    "Ca indicates debt which is in default and with \u2018some prospect for recovery in principal and interest, according to Moody\u2019s definition.",
    "\u201cThe existing Ca ratings on Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign currency senior unsecured debt issuances that are in default and will be exchanged for the new debt issuances reflect the expected financial loss and are unchanged,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.",
    "\u201cThe decision to place the issuer rating on review for upgrade reflects the announcement of the exchange offer by the government, which if successful will conclude the restructuring of its international bonds held by private-sector creditors and reduce the default risk on new and future issuances.",
    "\u201cIn particular, the relatively comprehensive debt restructuring and ongoing reforms under the government\u2019s programmes with development partners including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are leading to a significant reduction in external vulnerability and government liquidity risk, while raising prospects for fiscal and debt sustainability, albeit from a weak starting point.",
    "\u201cWillingness and capacity to implement reforms speak to Sri Lanka\u2019s governance, a driver of this rating action.\u201d",
    "The provisional ratings were assigned for GDP-linked bonds, Governance Linked Bonds and past due interest bonds."
