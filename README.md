🟩

The country's parliament has approved the legal source of the 16 -year -old people under the age of 16 in Australia.

The Senior Finance Council has also supported this as the legal source has already been approved in the Senate.

Prime Minister Antony Alpenis said the law was aimed at protecting children from the impact of social media.

Australian officials said that if the technology companies do not follow the law, they may be fined against them.

Critics, however, have commented that there is insufficient explanation of the impact on the internet and its impact on how the ban will work.
