Appeal – STOP aiding Israeli government’s continued slaughter of Palestine people

I am a Sri Lankan by descent. I also consider myself a “citizen” of South Asia (SA) despite India keeping the SAARC, a defunct association. I am a keen observer of SA politics and of regional and global conflicts.

You do not have to be told I know, Israeli attacks on Palestine civilians begun on 7 October 2023 in retaliation to a Hamas terror attack that took Israel by surprise, continues unabated and the toll of Palestine civilians killed end-June, 2024 according to the Gaza Ministry of Health is 38,000 humans. Yet “Lancet”, a peer reviewed, internationally recognised medical journal says it could now be around 186,000 people, as the “official toll does not take into account thousands of dead buried under rubble and indirect deaths due to destruction of health facilities, food distribution systems and other public infrastructure”.

Taxpayer rights have been steadily curtailed in recent policy changes

A taxpayer is required to file, a return of income, VAT return or SSCL return as the case may be on or before the due date. If the Inland Revenue officers are not in agreement with the return filed, they have a statutory right to raise an appropriate assessment on or before the expiry of the relevant time bar provided in the relevant statute. Generally, within a 30-day period a taxpayer of receipt of assessment has to appeal/request for administrative review against such to CGIR, specifying the grounds of appeal. Taxpayers dissatisfied with an assessment have recourse through a four-tier appellate system.

The tax assessment process commences with an inquiry, which may involve interviews and requests for documents. Following this, the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the taxpayer’s file may issue an assessment if they determine that the declared tax liability is incorrect.

The Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation will allocate an eight-acre plot of land in Vedamulla, Kelaniya, to H.M.K. Property Developers Ltd., for a Board of Investment (BOI) approved housing project.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the proposal, which involves a portion of land measuring eight acres, two roods and 16.26 perches, based on the current assessment by the Chief Assessor of the Government.

Initially, approval was given at a Cabinet Sub Committee meeting on Investment Promotion to provide a 12-acre plot of land for the project. However, due to H.M.K. Property Developers Ltd.’s failure to comply with the relevant agreements, the land was not released.

Recently, H.M.K. Property Developers Ltd., made another request through the BOI of Sri Lanka to obtain the land for implementing a housing project in three stages.

### NCE urges authorities to expedite Sri Lanka’s accession to Madrid Protocol

Sri Lanka exports a wide range of goods under various trademarks, contributing significantly to economic growth in international trade. As an exporters’ chamber, the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) actively encourages its members to export under their own brands. However, the cost of registering trademarks in multiple countries can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, registering in 10 countries means incurring tenfold the cost. The Madrid Protocol offers a solution to this issue.

The Madrid System, officially known as the Madrid Protocol, is an international treaty administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It provides a streamlined and cost-effective way for businesses to register their trademarks in multiple countries. Joining this system would offer significant benefits to Sri Lankan exporters.

He criticizes the lack of clarity on when the election will be held, hinting at potential government interference. Despite the Election Commission's readiness to announce the date soon, skepticism remains due to past delays and concerns over constitutional amendments and government involvement.

🟩

It is doubtful that the Election Commission has the authority to announce the date of the presidential election.. Opposition's Prime Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that this move would be given to the government to put a barrier to the election at some point.

He was speaking to the media after the meeting of party leaders on Friday (18) in Parliament.

A meeting of party leaders was held. Nothing talked about the constitutional amendment. However, the next parliamentary session is likely to bring about a constitutional amendment.

It is well known that the Election Commission has the authority to announce the date and announce the date after July 17. However, an official of the Election Commission said he would announce the presidential election at the end of this month. I ask why the date of the election should be seen until the end of the month. We are skeptical of this move by the Election Commission.
