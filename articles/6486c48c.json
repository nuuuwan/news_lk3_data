    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has essentially endorsed his predecessor President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s efforts to resolve Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis, according to former State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe.",
    "Speaking to reporters Wednesday September 25 evening following a meeting of MPs who backed Wickremesinghe for his reelection bid, Semasinghe said President Dissanayake has accepted that the Wickremesinghe administration\u2019s reform programme was a successful one.",
    "\u201cHe didn\u2019t do that before the election. Perhaps he has done a broader assessment of the economy since assuming duties. He has spoken about the importance of implementing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and continuing the debt restructuring process. I think they realise now that the measures we took to resolve this crisis were correct,\u201d he said.",
    "In his first ever televised address to the nation, Dissanayake said his government will start talks with the IMF to enhance economic stability and work with creditors.",
    "\u201cThere are many plans that we want to put in place. But before that we have to achieve stability,\u201d President Dissanayake said.",
    "\u201cWe will therefore start talks with the IMF and take forward the matters related to Extended Fund Facility (EFF).\u00a0 We will start discussions with creditor groups and wrap up debt restructuring and get the concessions as soon as possible.\u201d",
    "The United National Party (UNP)\u2019s Ashu Marasinghe told reporters that Wickremesinghe\u2019s camp is still discussing who should the prime minister \u2018candidate\u2019 for the parliamentary elections scheduled for November.",
    "\u201cWe must get everyone together and move forward,\u201d he said. Asked if that would include the rival Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), he said: \u201cThe discussion is to get everyone in the opposition on board.\u201d",
    "Former State Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama referred to a comment by President Dissanayake that good-faith actors were welcome to support his government.",
    "\u201cHe has said people who come in good faith are welcome. He too has opened the saloon door. He is now adjusting to the usual system little by little,\u201d said Amunugama.",
    "\u201cNo we don\u2019t plan to go. I\u2019m talking about what he said,\u201d he added.",
    "Former ruling party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Premanath C Dolawatte said Dissanayake will have to move past the campaign rhetoric now that he is president.",
    "\u201cHe is the president now. It doesn\u2019t matter what you said during the campaign. Use helicopters. They talk a lot about vehicles. Aren\u2019t those vehicles going to be distributed to officials? It has to be done. It doesn\u2019t matter what was said before the election.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s also the matter of his security. You\u2019re not the leader of the JVP or the NPP anymore. You\u2019re the leader of this country,\u201d he said.",
    "Daluwatta also said he was thankful that Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe and Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mahinda Siriwardena were retained by Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cThey criticised the central bank governor and the secretary to the ministry of finance before the election. But you made the right decision to retain them. You have approved what we did. It doesn\u2019t matter what you said before, but don\u2019t let the country fall,\u201d said Daluwatta. (Colombo/Sep26/2024)"
