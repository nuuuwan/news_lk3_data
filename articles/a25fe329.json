    "As the founding Managing Director of the International Hotel School (IHS), I placed hotel management development at the forefront of Mount Lavinia Hotel\u2019s (MLH) operations in the early 1990s. Several key members of our leadership team became both coaches to their respective departments; and students attending the IHS management seminars. This \u201cTeaching and Learning Culture,\u201d which I implemented helped me in my role as General Manager of MLH. Around this time, I also once again became a student. I pursued the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Diploma in Marketing in England, graduating in 1992 and becoming a CIM member in 1993.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the popularity of IHS\u2019s \u201cexpensive and lengthy\u201d week-long management seminars among hoteliers from other leading five-, four-, and three-star hotels in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Each management seminar attracted over 40 participants. At one seminar, a senior hotelier remarked, \u201cYou have introduced hotel administration studies to Sri Lanka.\u201d Soon, IHS began attracting the finest hoteliers in Sri Lanka to also participate as seminar panellists. The hard work of our team transformed IHS into an unprecedented hub for hotel management development in the country.",
    "With the increasing publicity for IHS in the print media and on television, we received numerous requests from other organizations to conduct training sessions, which opened new opportunities. We designed bespoke seminars not only for hotels but also for non-hotel organizations such as Air Lanka, the Sri Lanka Association of Personal Secretaries (SLAPS), the Sri Lanka Association of Musicians (SLAM), and the Military Police.",

    "Following a successful IHS seminar at MLH in 1991, I initiated discussions with participants about the largest global professional organisation for hospitality management \u2013 the Hotel Catering Institutional Management Association (HCIMA). At that time, it had 24,000 members across 104 countries. I was a member of HCIMA since 1984, having built strong connections with their head office in London and served on the Committee of the London Chapter in 1990.",
    "At the time, Sri Lanka had only six HCIMA members, and most IHS seminar attendees did not yet have the educational qualifications to become members. However, HCIMA awarded educational points for attending IHS seminars, creating significant interest. These points became a key selling point for IHS programmes.",
    "In late 1991, we established the Sri Lanka International Group (Chapter) of HCIMA, holding our inaugural meeting at my office in MLH. Professor Richard Kotas, a fellow of HCIMA, chaired the meeting, and I was elected as the Founding Chair of HCIMA \u2013 Sri Lanka. The well-known veteran civil administrator \u2013 Park Nadesan FHCIMA assisted me as the Founding Deputy Chair, and the Vice Principal of IHS \u2013 Kushan Dharmawardena was elected as the Founding Secretary. MLH became the official address of HCIMA \u2013 Sri Lanka.",

    "Within 18 months, our membership grew to 43, and upon my departure from Sri Lanka in 1994, my successor, hotelier Milinda Hettiarachchi, along with subsequent leaders, further elevated the chapter. Under hotelier Saman Rajapakse\u2019s leadership, HCIMA \u2013 Sri Lanka won the global HCIMA competition in 2004, earning the title of \u201cBest HCIMA Chapter in the World.\u201d This achievement helped secure my election in that year as the first non-European Worldwide President of HCIMA since its founding in 1938. I remain deeply proud of and grateful for the support of HCIMA \u2013 Sri Lanka.",
    "As my responsibilities at IHS expanded, I delegated day-to-day operations to my respected deputy, and the Principal of IHS \u2013 Eardley Edrisinha. I focused on public relations and building collaborations with our global partners. These partnerships included my former employer, Schiller International University campuses in the USA, UK, and Switzerland, Hotel Consult (now Institut H\u00f4telier C\u00e9sar Ritz), the International Management Institute (IMI) in Switzerland, the Hague Hotel School in the Netherlands, and Thames Valley University in the UK. I also continued to teach at Schiller\u2019s London campus during the summers and completed two short assignments as a Visiting Professor at IMI in Lucerne, Switzerland.",
    "1992 tourist off season (summer) educational activities of IHS at MLH",
    "I worked closely with Streamline Services, the student recruitment agency in Sri Lanka for the above post-secondary institutions. I maintained a strong relationship with my alma mater, the Ceylon Hotel School (now SLITHM), which was headed by one of my former students \u2013 Sarath Seneviratne. Sarath occasionally delivered guest lectures at IHS, and I taught marketing courses to final-year SLITHM students for three years, between 1991 and 1994. We both helped each other on honorary basis.",
    "Furthermore, IHS collaborated with the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s premier university. Having studied Business Administration there a decade earlier, I maintained valuable contacts. As of 2024, I continue to serve as a Visiting Lecturer for the university\u2019s Master\u2019s Degree in Tourism Economics and Hotel Management, and as the Consultant Dean of IHS (until March 2024). In the early 1990s, IHS also maintained close relationships with the Ceylon Tourist Board and the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL).",
    "One day, I received a telephone call from the President of THASL Professor M. T. A. Furkhan. He said: \u201cCongratulations, Chandana! You are doing a wonderful job in uplifting professional standards of the hotel industry in Sri Lanka. THASL Board has decided to invite you to become the Chairman of Hotel Skills Improvement subcommittee of our association.\u201d",
    "Then General Manager of Colombo Hilton, Gamini Fernando leading an IHS Seminar Panel",
    "I promptly accepted that honorary position. I told him that, \u201cAs I plan to arrange a support system within MLH and IHS, I don\u2019t need a large committee. Let\u2019s keep things simple and efficient. With my team and other volunteers, I will make things happen\u201d. He agreed, and three senior hoteliers served in the subcommittee \u2013 Asker Moosajee (Chairman of Serendib Tourinn Ltd. and former Chairman of Ceylon Tourist Board), Malin Hapugoda (a Director of John Keells Hotel Management Ltd.), and Eraj Abeywardena (Resident Manager of Hotel Lanka Oberoi).",
    "As the first step we examined all relevant studies done before and then did a survey with all hotels in Sri Lanka. We were shocked to learn that only 13% of the workforce in hotels has had vocational training. Based on that I convinced the subcommittee that the country needs a fast-track and short skill development programs which can be delivered within a week. All agreed with my vision, and we focused on six key categories of jobs (cooks, room attendants, waiters, bartenders, receptionists and supervisors). The emphasis was on essential skills. We then worked with SLITHM and IHS lectures in those specializations and prepared draft outlines for one-week long courses.",
    "After fine-tuning the syllabi with industry representatives, we delivered a three-day \u201cOn The Job Trainer\u201d certification (Train the Trainer) programme for 100 supervisors and managers from over 50 hotels. This successful programme enabled hotels nationwide to conduct rapid skills development using our syllabi for short one-week long courses.",
    "Thirty years later, despite ongoing challenges, Sri Lanka\u2019s hotel industry has made significant strides. Yet, every time I return to Sri Lanka as a tourist, I observe the persistent shortage of skilled hotel workers, exacerbated by overseas employment opportunities. Innovation, coupled with a continuous focus on \u201cmust-know\u201d skills, may hold the key to addressing these challenges and securing the industry\u2019s future.",
