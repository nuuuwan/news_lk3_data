This cartoon exposes a terrible contradiction in public policy by a simple act of writing and rewriting a word.

On the left, the Ministry of Health writes the word "Condom" in blue letters. Its code is clear: condoms are considered safety tools, focusing on public health campaigns against HIV, STDs and unplanned pregnancy. News Practice and Prevention - Health before judgment.

However, on the right, the Ministry of Education takes the same word and transforms it to "Condemn". With a red pen, the ministry re -writes the story effectively, replacing the security message with moral rejection. The student sitting below is clearly confused - a position for the youth of the community, trapped amidst the signals of companies that need to lead them.

### Thai court orders ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail

Thailand’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail because his detention in a VIP wing of a hospital in lieu of prison was unlawful, in another major blow for a powerful family that has dominated politics for two decades.

The judges said Thaksin did not have severe illness and his hospitalisation could not be counted as time served, adding the responsibility did not solely lie with the doctors and that the polarising billionaire intentionally prolonged his hospital stay.

Thaksin was seen at the court removing his jacket and getting into a corrections department van.

In a statement on Facebook, the tycoon said he accepted the verdict and would stay strong.

“Today, I may no longer have freedom, but have freedom of thought to create benefit for the country and people,” Thaksin said.
