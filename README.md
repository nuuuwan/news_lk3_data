### Why AKD-NPP have fallen in the polls, may lose elections

*2024-08-07 23:33:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-AKD-NPP-have-fallen-in-the-polls-may-lose-elections/4-765259) · `en`

“Additionally, the President highlighted the importance of promoting the Tamil language alongside Sinhala. He noted that with the anticipated economic growth in Tamil Nadu soon, Tamil-speaking Sri Lankans would have unique opportunities that others might not have.”

My salute to the people of Bangladesh led by their student youth, who have overthrown an autocrat in an unarmed uprising, sacrificing over 300 lives. We can also be proud of ourselves as Sri Lankans, since the autocrat mentioned our Aragalaya as an inspiration for the Bangladeshi youth. So much for so-called ‘anti-imperialists’ who revile it and are suspicious of People’s Power revolts.

In Sri Lanka’s election season, wannabe tyrants should tremble, and be deterred from any power-grab they may be planning.

TV news has shown President Wickremesinghe saying repeatedly on his recent visits to the North and East that “in this country we have 10 governments, 9 of which are Provincial Governments”.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, SLPP founder Basil Rajapaksa, and several other party members also attended the event.

Namala Rajapaksa had been tipped to be named as the SLPP’s presidential candidate after SLPP MP Dhammika Perera decided to withdraw from the race citing personal reasons.

The business magnate informed the party yesterday (6) that he will not contest the 2024 Presidential Election due to personal reasons.

Hence, the party leadership had decided to name an alternate candidate.

Rajapaksa, 38, is the youngest candidate in this election and if he wins, he will emerge as the youngest President int he history of Sri Lanka.
