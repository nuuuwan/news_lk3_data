    "Sri Lanka will target at least 322 new products at export level in 2024. \u201cThat would be our target in the \u2018One Village One Product\u2019 project, said State Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama.",
    "Speaking at a United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)- organized conference titled, \u201cSpice Horizons: Tracing the Legacy of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) on Ceylon Cinnamon and the Future of Other PGI Products for Agricultural Export Development\u201d on Tuesday at the Water\u2019s Edge, he thanked the European Union, UNIDO and the United Nations for support in investment promotion and overall assistance to Sri Lanka.",
    "Highlighting Sri Lanka\u2019s spices and the sector\u2019s potential for export opportunities and trade development, Amunugama said that due to the inherent quality of Ceylon spices, the sector has the potential to enhance value addition, meet the demands of international high end markets and promote technology adaptation.",
    "The event, organized with support from the Delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), will build on the success of Sri Lanka\u2019s first \u2018Protected Geographical Indications for Ceylon Cinnamon\u2019 project (PGI) with the European Union (EU), he noted.",
    "At the event, UNIDO also presented a new project proposal to expand the global reach of Ceylon spices and other agricultural commodities with PGI potential, such as pepper, coffee, pineapple, coconut and cashew, where the PGI Ceylon Cinnamon model can be replicated and scaled up for quality-led export development.",
    "Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, Research Economist Dilani Hirimuthugodage, a panelist at the discussion, speaking to The Island Financial Review: \u201cI think it is important for them to also focus on strategies to attract youth to agriculture mainly to the spice sector by giving them proper training and identity (make their self-esteem), strategies to strengthen the spice value chain with good linkage among each stage mainly to avoid asymmetry in information, encourage new technology by introducing smart agriculture, promote and market Ceylon GI, etc. are some of them.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe EU has worked with UNIDO on several projects in Sri Lanka supporting the agri-food sector. We are happy to see tangible outcomes such as the Ceylon Cinnamon PGI materialize, stated Dr. Johann Hesse, Head of Cooperation for the EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. \u201cThe proposed project will build on the success of the EU-funded \u2018Best Standardized Practices for the Agri-by Food Sector Development\u2019 (BESPA-FOOD) project, implemented by UNIDO jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\u201d",
    "The proposed project will draw on UNIDO\u2019s 2023 \u2018Value Chain Analysis on Pepper, Clove, and Nutmeg in Sri Lanka\u2019 also funded by the STDF, which identifies the gaps in food safety and quality, starting from farmgate to distribution on channels and right up to the retail market. The analysis outlines the necessary conditions to access international markets and gain a competitive advantage in international trade.",
    "Dr. Jairo Villamil-Diaz, International Senior Technical Specialist, UNIDO said, \u201cUNIDO worked closely with the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA), the Export Development Board (EDB), the Spice Council (TSC), the Spices and Allied Products Producers\u2019 and Traders\u2019 Association (SAPPTA), and other key public and private stakeholders, tirelessly striving to secure the PGI registration for Ceylon Cinnamon. We also provided similar support for Ceylon Tea. Now, Sri Lanka can leverage these learnings to ensure that other spices, like pepper, cloves, nutmeg/mace, and coffee become integral parts of the global food supply chain.\u201d",
    "In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Ministry of Industries, and State Ministry of Investment Promotion, the proposed project will guide Sri Lanka\u2019s agricultural sector towards quality-led export growth, supporting upstream actors in securing quality-based price differentials, improving price predictability and expanding access to premium markets. Additionally, UNIDO will continue to support the development of Ceylon Cinnamon, providing strategic guidance to further enhance the sector\u2019s global standing, including in securing PGI registration in other high-end markets.",
