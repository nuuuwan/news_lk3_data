It is essential that leadership development caters to an organisational need and is carefully planned and monitored

Effective leaders are those who enable positive people performance through role modelling, inspiring a shared vision, facilitating an environment of open and frank discussion, licensing the challenge of the status quo, enabling empowerment and decision making, and celebrating success. You do not necessarily have to be a good manager to be a good leader or vice versa. Leadership is hierarchy agnostic. In a corporate setting, leadership need not be confined to just the chief executive officer or the C-suite. It can be allowed to flourish at every level of the organisation provided the roles, and deliverables, of individuals and teams are clearly defined

When they depart, never to return, we are distraught.

### Provincializing Universities: The Risks & Dangerous Precedent Of The Newly Proposed NEPF

The new National Education Policy Framework (NEPF) currently being implemented by the government has begun to be noticed by the public. However, there is a noticeable absence of in-depth discussion of the implications of the policies that it proposes. So far critics have quite convincingly pointed out the neoliberal motives behind the proposals and the threat that it poses to the longstanding tradition of free education in Sri Lanka. These criticisms hold merit, as the compilers of the framework have failed to present any moral stance, such as a commitment to social justice and equity, within the document.

### Fear Of Tainted Politicians: To Hold Or Not To Hold Elections

Tainted politicians are abundant in Sri Lanka. If a small pebble were thrown from the spectator gallery in the legislature, there is a 99 percent chance it would hit the head of a scam-tainted politician. These individuals are either compromised by their own actions or by their association with and support for the most corrupt and vile political leaders alleged to have committed numerous crimes, including the embezzlement of state funds. Corruption among Sri Lankan politicians is rampant, a scourge that has undermined governance, the judiciary and civil liberties. It has stifled economic growth, and eroded the very fabric of society, a phenomenon that knows no boundaries. Its impact has been devastating, affecting not just the corridors of power but reaching deep into the daily lives of ordinary citizens for more than seven decades.

### Divesting SOEs can generate greater profits through taxation: Sri Lanka restructuring unit

ECONOMYNEXT – Some profitable state-owned enterprises are being divested because the government can generate far greater profits through taxation, Sri Lanka’s SOE restructuring unit has said.

“Taxes yield greater benefit to the public with far less financial cost and resources, burdening the country,” SOERU, established under the Ministry of Finance, said on its social media page X (twitter).

“The result is a healthier stronger economy and better governance.”

Sri Lanka has a total of 527 State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), according to its public finance department.

These have been used by politicians to give ‘jobs for the boys’, appropriate vehicles for personal use, fill boards of directors and key positions with henchmen and relatives, according to critics.

There have also been high profile procurement scandals connected to SOEs.

Last week, Sri Lanka passed a new Electricity Act which will enable the state-owned power utility, Ceylon Electricity Board, to be restructured.
