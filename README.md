### Go for the low hanging fruit, Mr. President

You are now the hope of those seven million pleading for a better quality of life

Your opponents’ claim was that you lack experience in the top job, they are correct. You do not have the experience of bringing down an entire economy, you do not have the experience of corrupt practices or poor governance. However, you have been able to observe these taking place over the years and that should have given you lessons and insights to bring such practices to an end. So never fear to try the untested

As they say in the classics, it’s done and dusted. Your long cherished dream of leading your country has come to fruition. It has been a long struggle from your humble beginnings in the village of Tambuttegama to the Presidential Palace in Colombo. Yet you have not lost your humility and simple way of life and the kitchen staff at President’s House will need to change menus to village style rice and curry dishes instead of French cuisines including award winning wines.

### Date of LG election from tourism point of view

Congratulations on your victory which not only belongs to you, but it is a very strong demonstration of how powerful the democratic process is here in Sri Lanka. Now the field is wide open for any underdogs to enter the race in the future. It was truly ground breaking in every possible way.

It was said that the just completed election was the most peaceful. Erik Solheim, former Norwegian Minister said, this election is a lesson for Western nations. Yet we all saw just a couple of days before the election US issued a travel advisory for its travellers. Just imagine that! People of this country completed the most peaceful election in the country ever had, yet US issued a travel advisory. Thankfully that advisory came in the last minute and the rest of the nations did not follow. Anyone dealing with travel advisories knows that they are contagious, when one country imposes them, other countries follow soon. As the saying goes “beggars can’t be choosers”, this is sadly our state.

### Here, and the road from here

*2024-10-02 00:08:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Here-and-the-road-from-here/4-767403) · `en`

The aftermath of the 2024 Presidential election was the most peaceful, ever. No fire-crackers, let alone gunshots or arson. An absence made possible by the NPP/JVP walking the talk. Given that public wrath at the political class played a decisive role in this election, a few incidents of over-the-top rejoicing might have been expected. But there were none. The election outcome amounted to a political upheaval, yet the country remained as calm as a goldfish bowl

Will President Dissanayake and his party be able to move beyond the restrictions imposed by their lingering primordial loyalties and appeal to non-Sinhala Lankans on a platform of genuine equality?

The Election Commission continues to rock. This week, it halted, for the duration of parliamentary polls, an order by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to increase fertiliser and fuel subsidies to farmers and fishermen.

The same way it stopped a multitude of giveaways by Ranil Wickremesinghe during Presidential elections.

### Expected dips in interest rates positively impact investor sentiment in share market

*2024-10-01 23:16:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/expected-dips-in-interest-rates-positively-impact-investor-sentiment-in-share-market/) · `en`

The stock market investor sentiment notably improved yesterday with the anticipation that interest rates would come down. Besides the debt restructuring process with bond dealers was reportedly going off smoothly. These developments positively impacted banking sector counters in the share market, analysts said.

In September, Sri Lanka experienced deflation for the first time since 2015, with the general price level falling below that of a year ago. This decline was driven by administrative price adjustments that brought down key cost drivers, including food, fuel, and water tariffs. This situation would considerably impact interest rates, market analysts added.

Without a comfortable victory in this battle AKD’s schedule for reforms and system change would die of stillbirth – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

From the voting behaviour demonstrated at the last Presidential election, it was evident that the three minorities had not kept abreast of the thirst for change that was awakening the Sinhalese community. Unfortunately, the Aragalaya effect did not penetrate sufficiently deeply into these communities. While ethnonationalism continued to rule the Tamil mindset, provincialism and religious fervour dictated the thinking and behaviour of Muslims, particularly in the Eastern Province. This provincial and religious mindset had been kept alive deliberately by local Muslim leaders ever since 1947

One of the most pressing challenges facing Dissanayake’s administration is the renegotiation of Sri Lanka’s debt. The island’s economy remains shackled by billions of dollars in foreign debt, with China, Japan, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) being its largest creditors. The austerity measures imposed by the IMF in exchange for bailout packages have further deepened the economic hardship experienced by ordinary Sri Lankans, leading to widespread resentment. Dissanayake has signalled his intention to renegotiate Sri Lanka’s debt on more favourable terms, seeking to alleviate the burden on the working class while pursuing a path of debt sustainability
