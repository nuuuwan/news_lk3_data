### Deleted CCTV footage recovered in Hatton bus accident

*2024-12-22 21:18:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104425/deleted-cctv-footage-recovered-in-hatton-bus-accident) ┬╖ `en`

Police have recovered the CCTV footage alleged to have been deleted from the private bus involved in a tragic accident in the Malliappuwa area on Saturday (21), which claimed the lives of three people including a school student.

The accident occurred at around 10.00 a.m. when a private passenger bus travelling from Hatton to Kandy veered off the road and plunged 20 feet down a concrete embankment. Initial investigations suggest that the driver lost control of the vehicle.

During police interrogations, the bus driver claimed that the bus door had opened, causing him to lose balance and nearly fall out. In an attempt to hold on to the steering wheel, he was unable to regain control, leading to the crash.

Police have discovered that someone had later deleted the CCTV footage recorded during the accident. However, using advanced technology methods, the police successfully recovered the footage, which they say provides critical evidence regarding the incident.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs state-run Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Electric Company has borrowed 230 million dollars from the Asian Development Bank for hydro power and to upgrade the grid for renewable energy under Treasury guarantees, a statement said.

A 200 million dollar loan from ADBтАЩs Ordinary Capital Resources will be taken through the Power System Strengthening and Renewable Energy Integration Project to integrate more renewable energy projects and maintain power system reliability.

Due to the intermittency or unreliability of renewable energy, power grids face high levels of volatility and needs extensive capital investments to withstand shocks.

The project will focus on strengthening and modernizing of climate-resilient transmission and distribution network to facilitate renewable integration and including enhanced renewable energy integration and grid management capabilities, the Finance Ministry said.

### A nation is the same election: a description

*2024-12-22 17:31:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201898) ┬╖ `ta`

India conducted simultaneous national elections from 1951 to 1967. This practice, known as "same election," refers to holding all parliamentary and state assembly polls on a single day. The rationale behind this approach includes efficiency in resource allocation and voter turnout. However, it also presents challenges such as coordinating across various states and managing potentially conflicting political agendas.

ЁЯЯй

Conducting elections on the same day is not a new experience for India. From 1951 to 1967, that was the case.
