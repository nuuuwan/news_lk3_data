    "It is welcome news for the global South that India and China are in a notable effort to reset their economic ties with the accent on pragmatism. Such policy adjustments could not only reap some important dividends for the countries concerned but bring considerable material benefits for South Asia and beyond.",
    "Accordingly, against the backdrop of intensifying trade battles between the US and the majority of major economic powers, an impending meet between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping needs to be seen by the developing world as a veritable \u2018stitch in time\u2019. What is needed right now is a coming together of the foremost economic powers of the South to ensure that the hemisphere\u2019s best interests are secured and mutually-beneficial economic relations between India and China could play a crucial role in this process.",
    "Unfortunately, over the past few years security and territorial issues which were dogging India-China ties for decades were allowed to hinder very significantly prospects of stepping-up and sustaining fruitful economic relations between the countries. These hindrances prevented spill-over economic benefits from stress-free ties between the regional notables from reaching the rest of Asia in particular. Thus, the reset in economic relations between India and China comes at a crucial hour for the South.",
    "If all goes well on the economic front between the \u2018Asian giants\u2019, the economic hegemony of the US could be successfully challenged. Needless to say, this is what is needed now when the US could be seen as virtually holding the rest of the world to ransom through its stringent tariff measures. South-South cooperation needs to come to its own and here\u2019s where China and India could help out.",
    "Unfortunately, what has been allowed to \u2018grab the headlines\u2019 over the decades in India-China ties has been the seemingly endemic power struggles between them. This is a gross misconception. If the observer \u2018goes behind the headlines\u2019 he would see that these major Asian powers have been fruitfully interacting in a number of spheres, particularly the economic. It could be said that there is great unfinished business between them which would be hopefully resumed and seen to a finish from now on.",
    "China and Indian joint scholarship has been flourishing on the subject of fruitful cooperation between the countries in a number of areas of mutual interest, including scientific and technological progress. However, at present the focus needs to be mainly on economic cooperation since that has particularly important implications for the rest of the world and for South Asia in particular.",
    "There has been, for instance, scholarly research on ways of linking some of the least developed regions of both countries, for the purpose of mutual benefit. However, such research transcends bilateral progress and prefigures the numerous ways in which wider Asia could benefit from such cooperative projects.",
    "Much research has focused, for example, on the wide-ranging benefits that could be reaped through the establishment of economic linkages between North-East India and South West China. Pointing to previous research done on the subject, Teiborlang T. Kharsyntiew, mentions at page 62 of the study titled \u2018India, China and Sub-regional Connectivities in South Asia\u2019, edited by D. Suba Chandran and Bhavna Singh and published by SAGE Publications, India, in 2015, as follows:",
    "\u2018A market of 400 million people is emerging, including neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Nepal which can be tapped\u2026 The region has the potential of developing into India\u2019s powerhouse; the area is a vibrant source of energy, rich in oil, natural gas, coal and limestone\u2026\u2019",
    "\u2018Locational advantages make this region attractive to foreign investment; it has unique proximity to other countries in South and Southeast Asia regions\u2019.",
    "We could be touching only the tip of the proverbial iceberg on the question of India-China economic cooperation and its benefits with the above observations. Besides the above study referred to there have been a number of joint research publications on how thriving bilateral ties between the countries could benefit them and the rest of the Asian region. The moment is \u2018Now\u2019 for India and China to accelerate their shared but badly interrupted journey towards bilateral wellbeing and beyond.",
    "Therefore, South-South economic linkages are coming to be stressed as perhaps never before. An obligation is cast on the totality of the South to recognize that none but it will face the worst economic and material hardships by not abandoning their persistent rivalries and by not coming together to manage the collective economic pressures generated by the US induced trade wars.",
    "That economics is a major determinant of politics is seen in the current efforts of China and India to defrost their ties and come together to inject added strength to their economic relations. From this point of view, formations where the countries are key members, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), BIMSTEC and BRICS would prove doubly important. Increasing economic pressures on the South could see a progressive strengthening of these formations and a further accentuation of East-West tensions along primarily economic lines; since military tensions of any kind are likely to be perceived by the antagonists as self-defeating.",
    "Given this backdrop it will be in the best interests of the economically vulnerable countries of the South to ensure that they build and sustain cordial relations with the East, that is, India and China in particular. While a policy of Non-alignment would prove to be best for the poor, they could, as India is doing, seek to establish and strengthen economic ties with as many countries as possible.",
    "Currently, India is exploring economic opportunities in some 50 countries, since dependence on the US and a few other economic powers could prove highly self-defeating from an economic view point. Economic pragmatism emerges as a highly recommendable policy.",
    "Going forward, Southern governments would be compelled to attach topmost priority to economic policy and its fallout considering that it would be their publics who would be facing the brunt of the ongoing global economic tussles. Goods and services will prove to be increasingly unaffordable since the prices of imports, for instance, would register a steep rise. However, Western publics too would face the same pressures and a relentless rise in social discontent everywhere should be braced for by governments.",
