  "original_body_lines": [
    "The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to demand a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza in a strong demonstration of global support for ending the Israel-Hamas war. The vote also showed the growing isolation of the United States and Israel.",
    "The vote in the 193-member world body was 153 in favor, 10 against and 23 abstentions, and ambassadors and other diplomats burst into applause as the final numbers were displayed. The United States and Israel were joined in opposing the resolution by eight countries \u2014 Austria, Czechia, Guatemala, Liberia, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay.",
    "The support was much higher than for an Oct. 27 Arab-sponsored resolution that called for a \u201chumanitarian truce\u201d leading to a cessation of hostilities, where the vote was 120-14 with 45 abstentions.",
    "\u201cToday was a historic day in terms of the powerful message that was sent from the General Assembly,\u201d Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, said after the vote. \u201cAnd it is our collective duty to continue in this path until we see an end to this aggression against our people, to see this war stopping against our people. It is our duty to save lives.\u201d",
    "The United States has grown increasingly isolated in its support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted about 240 in a surprise attack on Oct. 7.",
    "More than the United Nations or any other international organization, the United States is seen as the only entity capable of persuading Israel to accept a cease-fire as its closest ally and biggest supplier of weaponry.",
    "In tougher language than usual, though, President Joe Biden warned before the vote that Israel was losing international support because of its \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d of Gaza.",
    "After the United States vetoed a resolution in the Security Council on Friday demanding a humanitarian cease-fire, Arab and Islamic nations called for Tuesday\u2019s emergency session of the General Assembly to vote on a resolution making the same demand.",
    "Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding. But the assembly\u2019s messages are important barometers of world opinion.",
    "But Mansour said \u201cwe will not rest until we see compliance of Israel with this demand from the General Assembly so that we can see a cease-fire in place.\u201d",
    "The resolution makes no mention of Hamas, and the assembly defeated two proposed amendments mentioning the militant group. One, proposed by the United States, would have added a paragraph stating that the assembly \u201cunequivocally rejects and condemns the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas.\u201d The other, proposed by Austria, would have added a call for the immediate release of hostages still held by Hamas.",
    "The war, now in its third month, has brought unprecedented death and destruction, with much of northern Gaza obliterated, more than 18,000 Palestinians killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry, 70% of them reportedly children and women, and over 80% of the population of 2.3 million pushed from their homes.",
    "General Assembly President Dennis Francis, who chaired the meeting, said the world is witnessing \u201can onslaught on civilians, the breakdown of humanitarian systems, and profound disrespect for both international law and international humanitarian law.\u201d",
    "He said civilians should never undergo the level of suffering in Gaza and asked, \u201cHow many more thousands of lives must be lost before we do something? No more time is left. The carnage must stop.\u201d",
    "U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly \u201chow Israel defends itself matters,\u201d and she delivered several U.S. demands, which she said the Biden administration will press at the highest levels.",
    "\u201cIsrael must avoid mass displacement of civilians in the south of Gaza,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cIt must ensure sufficient humanitarian assistance to those who have fled violence and it must allow civilians in Gaza to return home as soon as conditions allow.\u201d",
    "But she made clear that the U.S. remains committed to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. She asked assembly members why it was so difficult for U.N. nations to condemn Hamas\u2019 \u201cterrorist actions\u201d on Oct. 7, \u201cto say unequivocally that murdering babies and gunning down parents in front of their children is horrific, that burning down houses while families shelter inside and taking civilian hostages in abhorrent.\u201d",
    "Israel\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan warned before the vote that a cease-fire \u201cwill only prolong the death and destruction in the region\u201d and will be \u201ca death sentence for countless more Israelis and Gazans.\u201d",
    "\u201cA cease-fire means one thing and one thing only \u2014 ensuring the survival of Hamas, ensuring the survival of genocidal terrorists committed to the annihilation of Israel and Jews,\u201d he said.",
    "Erdan said if U.N. member nations want a cease-fire they should call Hamas\u2019 office in Gaza. He held up a sign with a phone number and the name Yehya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Hamas attack, who is at the top of Israel\u2019s hit list.",
    "The resolution expresses \u201cgrave concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population,\u201d and it says Palestinians and Israelis must be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law.",
    "It also demands that all parties comply with international humanitarian law, \u201cnotably with regard to the protection of civilians,\u201d and calls for \u201cthe immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access.\u201d",
    "Tuesday\u2019s vote showed major shifts in voting. More than 25 countries that abstained on Oct. 27 supported Tuesday\u2019s cease-fire demand, including Albania, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Greece, Iceland, India, Iraq, Japan, Latvia, Monaco, North Macedonia, Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Moldova, San Marino, Serbia, Sweden, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Zambia.",
    "Croatia and Fiji went from voting no on Oct. 27 to voting yes on Tuesday, while Hungary, the Marshall Islands and Tonga went from voting no to abstaining."
