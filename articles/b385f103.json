  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka Police have initiated a special investigation into allegations of misuse of the President\u2019s Fund following directives from Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Priyantha Weerasuriya. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive inquiry into the matter.",
    "The decision comes in response to a formal complaint lodged by the Organisation of Lawyers to Protect Public Funds at the Police Headquarters yesterday. The group has called for an investigation into potential misappropriation of the President\u2019s Fund by several individuals, including Members of Parliament.",
    "Attorney Suranga Bandara, representing the organisation, alleged that significant sums of money were withdrawn from the President\u2019s Fund by certain MPs. He emphasised that the investigation should focus on whether these requests were made through formal channels and if any fraudulent practices occurred during the disbursement process.",
    "The President\u2019s Fund is a financial reserve intended for public welfare initiatives, and concerns over its misuse have raised questions about transparency and accountability in its administration.",
    "The Government recently disclosed that while it has been challenging for ordinary citizens with limited means to access assistance from the fund for health-related issues, millions had been allocated to Ministers and MPs as well as other notable figures by the previous administrations for their own health needs."
