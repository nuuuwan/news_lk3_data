    "Sri Lanka\u2019s current economic crisis could have been initially considered a man-made crisis rather than a natural crisis, but now it is vulnerable to becoming a natural crisis, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka Faris Hedad- Servos said.",
    "\u201cLack of proper economic management by the respective governments, outstanding debt composition and lack of competitiveness in global markets, resulted in this debt crisis, Hedad- Servos told a forum/panel discussion recently presided over by The Sunday lsland Editor Manik de Silva and Sunday Times Business Editor Faizal Samath. The forum was organized by the Sri Lanka Press Institute on the theme, \u201cTowards Sri Lanka\u2019s Recovery; Green Resilient and Inclusive Development\u201d.

    "\u201cOver the last many months Sri Lanka underwent a lot of difficulties due to external and internal shocks. Some of these were, the Easter Sunday attacks, Covid- 19 pandemic, political uncertainties and at the end everything public protests or the Aragalaya.",
    "\u201cHowever, just one year after all these shocks, Sri Lanka has showed some progress with the support of the IMF, though much needs to be done to put the country\u2019s economy back on track. Therefore, the World Bank has now committed US $ 700 million out of which US $ 500 million is for budgetary support and the balance will be utilized for social welfare.",
