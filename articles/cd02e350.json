    "The Government has decided to appoint two committees to provide sustainable solutions to the issues pertaining to the recruitment of school development officers for the teaching service.",
    "The two committees include a ministerial committee led by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and a committee of officials led by the Secretary to the Prime Minister.",
    "\u201cAt present over 15,800 development officers are engaged in teaching in both national and provincial schools. However, everyone must understand that the Government cannot provide instant solutions to complex and prolonged issues of this nature,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "He explained that between 1994 and 2020, over 150,000 graduates were employed under the Central Government and Provincial Councils including development officers, who were recruited into Government service through various schemes on seven separate occasions.",
    "\u201cHowever, it has been pointed out during the Cabinet meeting that these recruitment processes were carried out without properly evaluating the skills and professional qualifications of development officers and officers working in related service categories,\u201d he said, noting the lack of proper induction, in-service training and clear assignment of duties has hindered the ability of these officers to meet the expected performance standards.",
    "The two committees are tasked to identify various issues that have arisen at present pertaining to the administrative activities of the development officers and their performance and analysis of said issues and submission of sustainable solutions to these issues.",
    "Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government"
