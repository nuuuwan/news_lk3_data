### Why Sri Lanka needs stability, not diplomatic disruption, in London

London remains a critical hub for the financial and political community, and our High Commissioner—whose qualifications and experience are well suited to such a complex diplomatic post—has already been instrumental in strengthening Sri Lanka’s connections in this influential market. Removing him now would be short-sighted, not only disrupting essential progress but signalling uncertainty and inconsistency in our diplomatic priorities

As a Sri Lankan business leader with years invested in establishing our company’s presence in the UK, I’ve witnessed firsthand the critical role a steady diplomatic presence plays in navigating Sri Lanka’s international standing—especially in a place as significant as London. Recent news of the potential removal of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the UK after only one year is deeply concerning. This move risks undermining the very stability and reputation our country has struggled to regain following years of economic and political upheaval.

“The PTA, enacted in 1979, is well known as a draconian piece of legislation with broad emergency-like executive powers, but enacted for use in ordinary times as well.

“The provisions and scheme of the PTA fail to protect fundamental rights such as freedom from arbitrary arrest, freedom from torture and freedom of expression.

“The PTA, as implemented by successive governments since its enactment, has caused unmeasurable human suffering in the form of torture, long-term detentions and instilling fear in minorities and those critiquing the government.
