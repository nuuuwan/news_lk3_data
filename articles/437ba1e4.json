Since its inception on 10 October 1949, Sri Lanka Army has stood at the forefront of national security, defending the motherland and its people against visible or invisible challenges. At the moment where the institution celebrates its diamond jubilee on 10 October 2024, it is the prime time to honour the sacrifices of all who contributed to shape this illustrious journey from then to the present leadership.",
    "Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage RWP RSP ndu, who played a pivotal role in humanitarian operations to end a 30-year prolonged war, currently, serves as the 24th Commander of the Army. Under his leadership, Sri Lanka Army continues to uphold its dedicated mission of defending the nation progressively. His leadership, shaped by years of experience and valour, reflects the unyielding commitment of the institution towards its duties and responsibilities. The current Commander-in-Chief, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, also plays a vital role in guiding the Army\u2019s vision and progress, alongside Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and Defence Secretary Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyacontha (Retd) to fulfill the aspirations of the Nation in the coming years.",
    "The Sri Lanka Army\u2019s history is deeply connected with the nation\u2019s struggle to maintain sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. Its role in the elimination of the prolonged terrorism for thirty years is one of the most defining chapters in its legacy. Valourous and dedicated troops of the Sri Lanka Army successfully terminated the bitter, decades-long menace of terrorism, which tore apart families and communities, on 18 May 2009, bringing hope for a new beginning. The internal war began with the assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiappah in 1975 by Velupillai Prabhakaran, culminating in a hard-earned victory, paying blood and tears of thousands of soldiers and civilians.",
    "The Humanitarian Operations against Fourth Eelam War, launched on 26 July 2006, under the command of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and the leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa marking a decisive turning point in the nation\u2019s history. The operation, named \u201cEastern Humanitarian Operation,\u201d aimed to restore basic needs and protect civilians from the atrocities committed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The war reached a critical point when the LTTE blocked the Mavil Aru sluice gate, depriving 30,000 civilians\u2019 access to the water. This marked the beginning of a humanitarian effort to liberate the area to secure the region bringing peace.",
    "Following the Eastern Humanitarian Operation, the focus shifted to the North, where the LTTE had consolidated its power. The Northern Humanitarian Operation, initiated with the goal of liberating the Northern Province, was an arduous and strategically complex task. A key moment in this operation was the capture of the Silavathura Sea Tiger base in 2007 \u2013 a crucial supply hub for the LTTE. The combined Armed forces of the Army and Navy decisively captured the north- west supply hub of the foe, and by September 2, the camp had been captured.",
