*2024-08-01 14:50:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190008) · `ta`

### Concession to the importer and change the status of the national manufacturer - Sajith

He promises changes in the United People's Power regime to address these concerns.

Providing concessions to the importer and the burden to the national manufacturer must change the conditions.Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that if the current government does not change this position, we will change it in the United People's Power regime.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said this while addressing a discussion with traditional coconut oil producers on Wednesday (31).

Although a government policy that contains double policies that protect the manufacturer and consumers is required, today, the government's unreasonable policy is very unreasonable to impose an 18 percent tax on the domestic manufacturer and remove the tax on the imported coconut oil manufacturer and protect a few.

Although the five -star hostels will be given the right place to the national manufacturers, the national manufacturers and the producers have not been encouraged and supported.
