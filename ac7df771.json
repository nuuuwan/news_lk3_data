    "The U.N. human rights chief called on Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the mandate-holders of the UN Human Rights Council, which include special rapporteurs, independent experts and working groups.",
    "The 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Council convened on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland.",
    "Under the agenda Item 2 of the Council the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk presented the Human Rights Global Update.",
    "In his statement, the U.N. human rights chief stated that although the Sri Lankan government has regrettably rejected aspects of the UNHRC\u2019s resolutions related to accountability, it has continued to engage with the rights body\u2019s presence on the ground.",
    "He said that Sri Lanka has received a dozen visits by mandate-holders in the past decade, and encouraged Sri Lankan authorities to implement their recommendations.",
    "\u201cIn Sri Lanka, although the Government has regrettably rejected aspects of the Council\u2019s resolutions related to accountability, it has continued to engage with our presence on the ground. Sri Lanka has received a dozen visits by mandate-holders in the past decade, and I encourage the authorities to implement their recommendations,\u201d he said.",
    "Volker Turk, who took over as high commissioner in late 2022, used his opening speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday to urge greater cooperation and singled out states such as Syria, Iran, Israel and Russia that should do more.",
    "\u201cWe would now like to scale up engagement,\u201d he told the Geneva council at the opening of its four-week session, saying the world was at a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d 75 years after adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
    "\u201cI also believe that it is important for us to establish a presence for the first time in China and India \u2013 two countries which together comprise more than one-third of the world\u2019s population.\u201d",
    "More broadly, Turk had voiced concern about a \u201cstrangulation of civil society in several countries\u201d, without naming them.",
    "Turk said he would like to double his office\u2019s budget to step up global monitoring although this may prove challenging given that many countries oppose further scrutiny on sovereignty grounds.",
    "Turk also called on the United States to act urgently on racial discrimination and to ratify six human rights treaties, including one on child rights."
