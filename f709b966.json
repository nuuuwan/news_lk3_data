    "Kaur was fined 50 percent of her match fee for the Level 2 offence and received three demerit points on her disciplinary record.",
    "She was found guilty of breaching article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, relating to \u201cshowing dissent at an umpire\u2019s decision\u201d.",
