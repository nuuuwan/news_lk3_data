    "\u201cSri Lankan hospitality standards are very high, and hence we want to train some of our staff in Colombo. We have signed an agreement with veteran hotelier and former Ceylon Hotel School Chairman Chandra Mohotti to open the first Nigerian Sri Lanka Institute of Hospitality Management in Colombo,\u201d Ayade said.",
    "\u201cInitially, we will provide practical training to Nigerian hospitality students in Colombo star-class hotels. The second stage would be to acquire a star-class hotel for this purpose and also promote tourism,\u201d he added. \u201cWith more focused promotions, high-end Nigerian tourists could be attracted to Sri Lanka, and he will also open a travel arm in Nigeria for this purpose once he acquires the hotel in Sri Lanka.\u201d",

    "Ariya Food is already exporting Sri Lankan fruits and vegetables to the Gulf via leading supermarket chains like Lulu and Carrefour, and hence, they could channel these exports via Dubai."
