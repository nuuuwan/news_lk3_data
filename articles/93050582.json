    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Business travel is set to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024, faster than previously predicted, to reach a record 1.5 trillion US dollars, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) said.",
    "The rise of remote working during the pandemic had a disproportionate effect on corporate travel, compared to leisure travel, with virtual platforms replacing face-to-face meetings, the WTTC said in a statement on Thursday October 10.",
    "\u201cLast year, leisure travel was just 2.9 percent behind the 2019 peak, whilst business travel continued to struggle, remaining 5.4% percent behind. But as business leaders re-emphasised the importance of face-to-face interaction, business travel is now back and is set to exceed 2019 levels by an impressive 6.2 percent to reach the new 1.5 trillion US dollar record.\u201d",
    "According to WTTC\u2019s \u20182024 Economic Impact Trends Report\u2019, business travel spending in the U.S., which accounted for 30 percent of the global total in 2019, is expected to reach 472 billion US dollars this year \u2014 13.4 percent above the country\u2019s 2019 record.",
    "In China, the world\u2019s second largest market for business travel, spending is forecast to grow 13.1 percent above 2019 to reach almost 211 billion dollars, the WTTC said.",
    "Business travel spend in Germany, the third largest, is set to reach 87.5 billion dollars, just under 1 percent above the 2019 peak, while business travel in the UK and France is expected to inject a record-breaking 84.1 billion dollars and 42.1 billion dollars into their respective economies, the council said in its statement.",
    "\u201cAfter a challenging few years, business travel is not only back on track, but it is recovering much faster than expected, highlighting the importance of international travel for businesses around the world,\u201d WTTC President & CEO Julia Simpson was quoted as saying at the global tourism body\u2019s 24th Global Summit in Perth, Western Australia.",
    "\u201cMany business powerhouses such as the US, China and Germany are expected to reach record numbers this year. While virtual meetings played a crucial role during the pandemic, keeping people and businesses connected, today\u2019s report shows that business is better face to face,\u201d she said.",
    "American Express Global Business CEO Paul Abbott said: \u201cCompanies around the world value travel and in-person connections more than ever, since people movement was restricted during the pandemic.",
    "\u201cWe always said travel was a force for good, driving economic and societal progress. But when travel stopped, GDP plummeted, unemployment soared, mental health issues escalated, and the world became a less tolerant place. The benefits of travel are now no longer in doubt. Companies around the world \u2013 many for the first time \u2013 are investing in managed business travel to grow their businesses and create winning cultures.\u201d",
    "According to the report, other factors have also contributed to the resurgence of business travel.",
    "As economies around the world have rebounded since the pandemic, with Travel & Tourism\u2019s global GDP contribution reaching record levels, businesses have been able to reallocate more funds towards corporate travel once again.",
    "\u201cThe growth of blended travel, whereby travellers combine business trips with personal holidays, has also enhanced the appeal of corporate travel.",
    "\u201cThe meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) industry has also made a strong comeback, resuming in-person events after a long period of cancellations and postponements.\u201d (Perth/Oct10/2024)"
