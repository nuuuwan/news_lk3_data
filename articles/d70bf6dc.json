    "Main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday welcomed the United States\u2019 decision to reduce tariffs on Sri Lankan exports to 20%. In a message posted on X, he argued that Sri Lanka should push for a further reduction to 15% to boost its export competitiveness. \u201cThis puts us on par with Vietnam and Bangladesh, while India pays 25%,\u201d he said. \u201cA rate under 15% would give our exporters a real lift. We should field a team of trade economists and experienced negotiators to keep pressing forward.\u201d",
    "SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva also responded to the announcement, attributing the outcome to efforts on both sides. \u201cGlad that US tariffs on Sri Lankan exports are at 20%. We can continue to be regionally competitive,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cCredit goes to all who worked on it on the Sri Lankan side, both seen and unseen, and appreciation to the US Trade Representative for understanding our limitations. Let\u2019s now seriously work on breaking down the walls around us and building bridges to the world.\u201d"
