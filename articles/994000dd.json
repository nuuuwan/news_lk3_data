  "original_body_lines": [
    "A seemingly delighted US President Donald Trump said that the most recent proposal for peace in the Middle East, which he helped broker, was coinciding with the dawning of the best of days for the world. He was standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House press conference on Monday and the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s body language seemed to suggest that he was in perfect accord with the US President.",
    "The conscience-stricken of the world are likely to hope that this time around the door is being opened for a permanent political settlement in the Middle East. To be sure, there are numerous positives in the recently announced US-initiated peace bid on which there seems to be considerable Israeli agreement as well. However, the troubling poser is whether Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups would be willing to give it a try.",
    "At the time of writing no such agreement has surfaced. If they do agree Hamas and other militants would need to disarm and dismantle their military capability. Here\u2019s where the rub is. Besides, they may need to give the \u2018Two State Solution\u2019 a try. Right now we do not seem to be anywhere near this possibility.",
    "Moreover, time has emerged as a crucial factor. If Hamas shows no signs of cooperating to implement the proposal, the possibility is that the US President would be giving Israel \u2018the go ahead\u2019 to \u2018finish the job\u2019; that is, militarily wiping out Hamas.",
    "Yet, the positives in the peace move need to be recognized. For instance, there would be no question of evacuating the remaining civilians from the Gaza Strip. There would also be no \u2018occupation\u2019 of the Gaza by the Israelis. Instead top priority would be given to the physical re-building of the war-devastated region. Humanitarian help would also be available in good measure and an exchange of hostages is to be prominently on the cards.",
    "It is also envisaged that Gaza would be administered by an international body headed by the US President if the proposal is accepted. The US, Qatar and Israel are expected to work towards the implementation of this project. In fact the peace plan is believed to be having some 20 key points.",
    "Besides the other imponderables the peace proposal gives rise to, the Arab-Islamic world is unlikely to be in full agreement on bringing the \u2018international body\u2019 under the leadership of the US President, given his staunch alliance with Israel. The question would arise whether the US is discharging its responsibilities impartially and justly.",
    "A grave impediment also takes the form of President Trump\u2019s most recent pronouncement to the effect that US allies would be \u2018foolish\u2019 to recognize \u2018a Palestinian state\u2019. The cause of Middle East peace in fact is as good as lost minus the realization of a Palestinian state, considering that there is no alternative at present to the \u2018Two State\u2019 solution.",
    "Yet, the world community has no choice but to focus on the positives in the current peace proposal and explore the possibility of making them a cornerstone of another major peace effort. A task for the immediate future is the initiation of a dialogue by pro-peace major European democracies with the US with the aim of convincing the latter of the merits of recognizing Palestinian statehood.",
    "Pro-peace sections of the world community need to also take on the major question of Israel\u2019s insecurities which hitherto has negatively impacted all attempts at bringing peace to the Middle East. Inasmuch as Palestinian statehood needs to be recognized, so must Israel\u2019s insecurities be addressed and eliminated through an international recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist.",
    "Accordingly, if Israel\u2019s neighbours, for example, are convinced into being less hostile towards it, the prospects for regional peace could be considerably improved. Those Arab states which have allied with the US in the peace bid could perhaps be relied upon to exert themselves in this direction.",
    "The disarming of anti-Israeli militants could prove very much easier if the latter mega projects in peace-making are initiated by the international community. The world has no choice but to rely considerably on the UN in these undertakings. Despite its perceived limitations there is no escaping the reality that only the UN could garner the most credibility among the global community in peace-building and reconciliation. Unfortunately, the US wouldn\u2019t be accepted as peace-maker by the totality of the Arab-Islamic world on account of the divisive role it has played in international politics thus far.",
    "However, there is no denying that it is the universal conviction that the UN is an effective peace maker that would enable the totality of the world community to back it unreservedly. Since peace-making continues to be a vital responsibility of the UN Security Council (UNSC) it is the latter organ that must be reformed, revitalized and rendered an effective instrument of peace-making and reconciliation.",
    "Fortunately, the UN Secretary General is giving much thought to this question of UNSC reform. The log jam to be removed is the very often biased and negatively-oriented use of the veto by UNSC members. This power gets in the way of the swift resolution of international disputes and ensures their prolongation.",
    "Accordingly, the membership of the UNSC needs to be more broad-based to ensure a more equitable articulation of international opinion on thorny issues. Needless to say, the current composition of the UNSC falls far short of these norms. There are countries such as India, South Africa and Brazil, major powers in their own right, who must be in the UNSC fold.",
    "To be sure, UN reform is a long-gestation project and the world\u2019s turmoil, meanwhile, is on the upswing. The requirement of the present is to contain such suffering. A getting together of the peace-inclined among UN member states and the exercising of moral pressure persistently by them on the US could pay some peace dividends in the medium term in connection with the Middle East.",
    "The international \u2018peace constituency\u2019 has on its side major democracies of the likes of Britain, France and other important states within the EU fold. These \u2018peace voices\u2019 need to get their act together and work dynamically towards an early resolution of international disputes besides helping in UN reform.",
