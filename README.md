### Honouring the Unsung Heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

Hooray and congratulations! Our national cricket team won a full series of matches. It was against Afghanistan, but no matter, at last we have won a whole series. It was refreshing to see our team win. The huge crowd at the third T-20 match, vouched for the regeneration of interest among the fans of the game in the country.

While we won all of the test matches, it was the absence of spectators which was prominent. Despite the fact entrance to the games were free, a sparse crowd attended the matches.

During an earlier era we were enthralled when we beat teams like India, Pakistan and Australia. In those days beating even England was no big deal.

But times have changed. At the Dambulla Cricket Stadium where the last T-20 match between Afghanistan and our national team took place, we witnessed a sad change for the worse in the spirit the game was played.

If dignity was what the retired general was after, higher pensions/benefits to lower rank retirees would have served better (especially the disabled/seriously injured)

“Are we so morally sick, so deaf and dumb and blind, that we do not understand this?”

In 2023, bankrupt Sri Lanka added $ 16.6 billion to its central government debt, an increase of 21%.

Sri Lanka ranks a high 43 in Global Militarisation Index and a low 83 in Social Progress Index. When it comes to militarisation, Sri Lanka outranks most developed countries. We also outrank our neighbours, including India (77); only Pakistan, at 44, is slightly ahead of us.

### Adani wind project in Mannar and ecological threats

The panellists viewed Mannar as a pristine location and failed to acknowledge the serious threats facing the island’s ecology on multiple fronts

Wind farms located at close proximity to wetlands is not a new phenomenon. Thus, Mannar is not an exception. Experts covering various fields should work as a team and collaborate to formulate rules and guidelines to cover matters such as setback from sensitive zones, adoption of mitigatory measures, collection of data from operational wind farms for analysis, etc. The experiences drawn in Mannar will become useful as more project developments take place in wind resource rich regions of SL

Having attended the 27 February WNPS hosted media conference that highlighted ecological threats faced in Mannar due to the proposed wind farm development by the Adani group, I am sharing my views below:

### Honouring the unsung heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

The team reviewed more than 5,000 photos and 50 hours of footage of the attacks, as well as conducting interviews with dozens of Israeli officials. It said the true prevalence of sexual violence during the attack and afterward “may take months or years to emerge and may never be fully known.”

He said this while addressing the second day debate on the Bind Receivables Bill, Trusting Receivables (Amendment) Bill, Amendment (Amendment) Bill, Financial Leasing (Amendment) Bill.

Other banks and financial institutions in the country are based on the actions of the central bank in the country. Bank loans are only one hundred per cent of the Central Bank. But if the rest of the country goes to the banks of the country, the interest is 20.5 per cent.. That is why when we were told to allow the central bank to act independently, we were told that it should be somewhat independent.

The lack of chance of state officials to clarify the allegations made by a few MPs will be considered unjust.

If there are any problems with state officials, there are instructions for handling it properly. Therefore, MPs must avoid the proposal of false accusations to insult state officials. Therefore, I urge you to remove the allegations leveled at state officials in accordance with the Secondary Command (91) (9).
