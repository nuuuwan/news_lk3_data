    "Hardly a parliamentary session passes without the members of the Opposition and the government clashing over the drug menace, and hurling wild allegations against one another. Their arguments and counterarguments on what is described as a consignment of drugs/precursors found in two containers in Middeniya recently continue to dominate debates in the House, and invariably lead to mudslinging. Yesterday was no exception.",
    "A question often raised in Parliament is why the aforesaid containers were released by the Customs despite a tip-off that they carried narcotics/chemicals used to manufacture crystal methamphetamine or ICE. The government insists that the Customs and the police inspected the containers thoroughly but found nothing suspicious in them and therefore released them. If so, how come drugs/precursors were found in them afterwards. This question has gone unanswered.",
    "Given that narcotics/precursors have been found in two containers inspected by the Customs and the Police Narcotics Bureau sleuths, what the other containers released without any inspection carry is anyone\u2019s guess. In January 2025, as many as 324 cargo containers including many red-flagged ones were released without inspection allegedly at the behest of the government. It is being asked in some quarters whether the drugs/precursors detected in Meddeniya had been smuggled in two of the 324 containers, and the aforesaid tip-off had been a red herring. The Opposition has also demanded to know whether it was known to the authorities that the containers found in Meddeniya carried narcotics/precursors but they were released as part of a plan to frame some politicians. This country has more than its fair share of conspiracy theories, but anything is possible in Sri Lankan politics.",
    "Both the Opposition and the government lack credibility and are notorious for making bogus claims. So, what they say about anything should be taken with a pinch of salt. Sri Lankan politicians make mountains out of molehills, when out of power, to discredit governments, and their ruling party counterparts make molehills out of mountains, as it were, and the public is left so confused that they cannot figure out whether a mountain is actually a mountain or a molehill! However, the Opposition has made a demand that sounds reasonable; it wants a thorough probe conducted into the release of the two containers where drugs/precursors were found, because the possibility of someone having released them despite detecting banned substances therein cannot be ruled out. Action must be taken against those who released them. The Customs do not even release a bundle of magazines sent by parcel post without inspection\u2014and rightly so. Narcotics have been found in hollowed-out books and magazines. People who visit the Central Mail Exchange to collect parcels are kept waiting for hours. How come the Customs release cargo containers via the green channel? The release of the 323 containers must also be investigated.",
    "One should not be so na\u00efve as to expect the current dispensation to order probes into the controversial container releases and open a can of worms in the process. All signs are that we will have to wait until the next regime change to have those scandals probed\u2014if at all.",
    "Meanwhile, let the Opposition be urged to secure copies of all documents pertaining to the controversial containers from the Customs, and keep them. One may recall that the National Medicines Regulatory Authority data pertaining to drug registration was wiped out in 2021. There have been instances where even court products went missing and where narcotics samples sent for testing to the Government Analyst\u2019s Department turned out to kurakkan flour.",
