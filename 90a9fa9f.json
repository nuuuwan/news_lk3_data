Siriwardana, Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies on Saturday signed the Exchange of Notes for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) project in the presence of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and Minister Hayashi.",
    "Through the Exchange of Notes, the Government of Japan has provided a grant aid worth approximately Rs.611 million (\u00a5 284 million) for this project. This project aims to train young executive officers in the public sector at various universities in Japan and develop their skills in order to qualify them as future national leaders in their respective fields. Under the project, 17 public sector officials will be sent to pursue a two to three year Master or PhD degree from 2024. Areas of their degrees cover Public Policy, Macroeconomics, Public Finance and Investment Management, Industry Development Policy and Investment Promotion, and Urban and Regional Development.",
    "Since its inception in 2010, JDS project has supported 205 public sector officials in Sri Lanka. The project will contribute not only to enhancing individual capacities but also to improving institutional capacity of the public sector in Sri Lanka, which helps Sri Lanka to overcome various difficulties related to the current economic hardships and to achieve prosperity further in the future.",
    "JDS fellows are also expected to solidify foundations to further bilateral relations with Japan and succeed as a bridge between both countries by utilising their human network developed through academic and social activities while in Japan.",
    "As a long-standing friend, Japan has placed great emphasis on assistance in human resource development via many capacity building and skills development programs in order to accelerate long-term sustainable economic development.",
    "\u201cAs various endeavours such as reforms on revenue and expenditure, state-owned enterprises as well as the eradication of corruption are expected to be implemented this year, the year 2023 would mark a milestone in kicking off the rebirth of Sri Lankan economy. We sincerely hope that all of them will strengthen connection among them and contribute to help rebuild Sri Lanka by capitalising on what they learned after they return to home country,\u201d Japanese Embassy said."
