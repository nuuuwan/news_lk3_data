    "Beyond providing scholarships and developing community infrastructure, the Cargills Sarubima programme aims to enhance students\u2019 knowledge by improving access to quality education and equipping them to become future leaders of Sri Lanka.",
    "Since its inception in 2008, Cargills Sarubima programme has been a key pillar of the company\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility efforts. It reflects Cargills\u2019 philosophy of working directly with rural farming communities across Sri Lanka. It was established to build a deeper connection with these farmers and their families, recognizing their hard work and contribution to the nation. Over the years, thousands of families have benefited, and this year, Cargills has significantly increased its allocation to further expand the programme\u2019s impact.",
    "Speaking at the event, Minister Lal Kantha commended the Cargills Group for its significant contribution to strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s farming community. He highlighted the Group\u2019s role in creating reliable markets for local farmers and connecting them directly with consumers. The Minister recalled a recent instance where Cargills stepped in to purchase a surplus harvest, ensuring farmers\u2019 livelihoods were protected \u2013 a responsibility, he noted, that very few in the country would able to shoulder.",
    "As the largest buyer of fresh produce and milk in Sri Lanka, Cargills engages with over 23,000 smallholder farmers across the island, providing access to technology, agricultural extension services, credit facilities, quality inputs, and assured market access. Annually, Cargills purchases over Rs. 18 billion worth of fresh produce and milk from these farmers, with these payments flowing directly into rural communities, supporting the backbone of the nation\u2019s economy. This integrated approach ensures sustainable support while enhancing productivity and livelihoods.",
