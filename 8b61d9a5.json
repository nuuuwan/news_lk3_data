    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said he wishes to see Sri Lanka become a developed country like South Korea by 2048 while addressing the delegation of Sri Lankan Scouts participating in the 25th World Scout Jamboree to be held in South Korea.",
    "\"Korea was poorer than Sri Lanka. But since 1965, they decided to become a developed country together. We didn't follow their path. I wish to make Sri Lanka a developed country like Korea by 2048,\" Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\"We did not follow the path where Korea went. We did not think of developing the country. We received everything free of charge and thought all we needed would fall from the sky. Finally, the country became bankrupt. We took over this country from bankruptcy to develop it, not to go back to where we were.",
    "\"We cannot use old methods for the development of the country. The Koreans removed all the old methods from their target of where they are now. They thought new and became a country that anyone could not imagine. China also got rid of old methods in 1978 and has become the most powerful country now,\" the President said.",
    "Therefore, the President requested all the people in the country work hard to see the country developed by 2048."
