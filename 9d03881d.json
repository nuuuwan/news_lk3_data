  "original_body_lines": [
    "Tamil Nadu in South India is geographically  the closest Indian state to Sri Lanka. Tamil Nadu meaning Tamil country has a population of 72,147,030 according to the 2011 Census.  The state has spawned many colourful political personalities. Standing out among these figures is  actress -politico Jayalalithaa Jayaram who was elected as Tamil Nadu chief minister four times and served in that position for almost 16 years. The alluring actress turned powerful politician reigned over  India\u2019s sixth largest state like a \u2018boss lady\u201d. She also ruled her party the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(AIADMK) in an autocratic manner.",
    "Jayalalithaa  Jayaram passed away in December 2016. If the \u201cIron Butterfly\u201d was among the living  now, she would have celebrated her 75th birth anniversary on February 24th. It is against this backdrop that  this week\u2019s  \u201cPolitical Pulse\u201d Column   focuses   on Jayalalithaa  while drawing from my earlier writings about her.",
    "Jayalalithaa led the AIADMK from 1989 until her death in 2016. She was elected four times in general elections  as Tamil Nadu Chief minister. She served three full terms  in 1991-96, 2001-06 and  2011- 16. However she had to step down as chief minister twice due to legal impediments  caused by charges of alleged corruption and acquisition of disproportionate assets against her. She   regained  her post as chief minister on both occasions.Jayalalithaa  was elected chief minister a fourth time in 2016 but fell ill and died a few months later in the same year. Had she not passed away, Jayalalithaa would have  definitely been convicted and imprisoned for corruption and forfeited her chief minister post. Death through illness spared her that ignominy.",
    "Notwithstanding the corruption charges, Jayalalithaa  was the sole repository of power in the  AIADMK administrations she presided over. AS chief minister, she was in practice the ruling deity of Tamil Nadu. Her followers, supporters and sycophants referred to her respectfully as \u201cAmma\u201d which means both mother and also   a superior woman. Amma is both an endearing as well as respectful form of address. In Tamil Nadu under Jayalalithaa rule , there was only one \u201cAmma\u201d and that was her. From state administered cheap food restaurants to privately run cinema halls  \u201cAmma\u201dwas the brand name. Cardboard cut-outs and colouful posters hailing \u201cAmma Jayalalithaa\u201d dotted  the landscape of Tamil Nadu then . \u201cAmma\u201d or boss lady  was omnipresent and omnipotent.",
    "Jayalalithaa usually kept  her party members and supporters at a distance. But when she triumphed  at an election Jayalalithaa allowed party members to  come up to her and offer their wishes and praises. This they did with gusto in a disgusting exhibition of servile sycophancy. Thousands of supporters  crawled  before their divine \u201cAmma\u201d and prostrated themselves at her feet. Jayalalithaa had Tamil Nadu at her feet metaphorically and also literally.",
    "Tamil Nadu was once the cradle of the \u201cSuya mariyaathai Iyakkam\u201d or the \u201cSelf \u2013 respect Movement. It was in essence a Dravidian revolt against perceived Aryan dominance in the form of Brahminism. Ironically  Dravidian Tamil Nadu fawned  at the feet of \u201cPaappaathi\u201d (Brahmin woman) Jayalalithaa without any semblance of self \u2013 respect.",
    "Jayalalithaa was born on February 24, 1948 in Mysore in the Karnataka state of today.She is of Tamil Vaishnavite Brahmin Aiyengaar stock hailing from Srirangam in the Trichy district of Tamil Nadu state. Both her paternal and maternal grandparents relocated to the state of Karnataka which was formerly known as Mysore.  Her paternal grandfather was Dr. Narasimhan Rangachary who  served as the court physician to Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, who reigned as the Maharajah of Mysore from 1894 to 1940. Her maternal grandfather Rengasamy Aiyengar worked at Hindustan Aeronautics in Bangalore now Bengaluru..",
    "Jayalalithaa\u2019s father Jayaram was a wastrel who squandered the family fortune away through gambling and betting.  He died when Jayalalithaa was two. Jayalalithaa\u2019s widowed  mother Vedavalli,  turned to acting in films  for a living. She adopted the screen name Sandhya.",
    "Jayalalithaa herself was born in Melukote in the Pandavapura division of Mandya district in Karnataka.  She was given her grandmother\u2019s name Koamalavalli at the time of birth. The name Jayalalithaa was adopted later when she became an actress.. It was derived from the names of two houses where she had  resided in Mysore. One was \u201cJaya Vilas\u201d and the other \u201cLalitha Vilas\u201d. Her name was originally spelled with one \u2018a\u2019 at the end. Later another \u2018a\u2019 was added for numerological reasons. Jayalalitha became Jayalalithaa. However, she was widely known by her pet name \u201cAmmu\u201d. In later years  \u201cAmmu\u201d  gave  way to \u201cAmma,\u201d",
    "Since she was born in Karnataka there are many who think Jayalalithaa is a Kannadiga. She is however a \u201cThamizhachi\u201d (Tamil woman), fiercely proud of her Tamil ethnicity and Tamil Nadu roots.An incident that occurred decades ago when Jayalalithaa was a film star without any involvement in politics illustrates both her courage and pride in being Tamil.",
    "It was the year 1970. Jayalalithaa had agreed to perform with her dance troupe at an exhibition held at Bengaluru (then Bangalore) in Karnataka. Due to her shooting schedule going awry,  Jayalalithaa had to cancel the performance at the last minute. This led to Vatal Nagaraj, the leader of a Karnataka-based political outfit known as the \u201cKannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha,\u201d issuing a statement condemning her for cancelling the event despite being a Kannadiga woman.",
    "Vatal Nagaraj, a Kannadiga chauvinist, was a dreaded figure in Karnataka like Bal Thackeray of the Shiv Sena was in Maharashtra state. In spite of Vatal Nagaraj\u2019s fearsome reputation, Jayalalithaa responded bravely by issuing a statement contradicting him.",
    "Jayalalithaa said though born in Karnataka she was a Tamil and not a Kannadiga. An infuriated Nagaraj then warned her not to set foot again on Karnataka soil. Jayalalithaa replied that if and when necessary she would set foot on Karnataka soil.",
    "A few weeks later Jayalalithaa was at the Premier Studio in Bangalore where the shooting of the film \u2018Ganga Gowri\u2019 was taking place. The director was the famous Kannadiga filmmaker B.R. Panthulu.. A gang of thuggish activists from Vatal Nagaraj\u2019s outfit got to know of this and invaded the studio premises.",
    "The mob surrounded Jayalalithaa and demanded that she withdraw her statement of being a Tamil woman and apologise to the people of Karnataka.Jayalalithaa was defiant. She refused to do so and kept repeating, \u201cI am not a Kannada woman. I am a Tamil Woman\u201d to the mob that had encircled her. It was with great difficulty that members of the film crew, studio workers and media personnel prevented the goondas from assaulting the unflinching actress.",
    "Finally the Police arrived and dispersed the mob. Jayalalithaa however remained unbowed and unafraid to the very end.",
    "This incident happened when Jayalalithaa was not engaged in politics or entertained any political ambition. Jayalalithaa reiterating her Tamilness even in the face of danger was therefore not a political stunt but a genuine reaction that reflected her inherent courage and Tamil consciousness.",
    "In later life several of her political opponents tried to portray her as a Kannada woman in a cheap ruse to alienate her from voters in Tamil Nadu. This did not work.",
    "Jayalalithaa studied at Church Park Convent in Chennai. She  passed her SSLC/Matriculation exams with flying colours. Her marks were the second highest in the state. Entitled to a merit scholarship, Jayalalithaa obtained admission to Stella Maris College in Madras to follow PUC classes when the academic term began. But life changed when she got offers to act in films. Although Jayalalithaa wanted to pursue her studies and become a lawyer, her mother wanted  her to take up a film career as the family was in dire financial straits. The daughter was asked to make the correct choice. After a long night of deep thought Jayalalithaa conveyed her decision in the morning. It was adieu to studies.",
    "Very few people  looking at  her rotund appearance of later years would be able to  imagine the time when Jayalalithaa was slim and lissom. That she was and a ravishing beauty too. All one has to do is to view a DVD of  one of her movies.  As an actress, Jayalalithaa was the uncrowned queen of Tamil cinema during the mid-\u201960s to the mid-\u201970s of the last century, the dream girl of many a teenager and the favourite pin-up star of many fans. As an actress Jayalalithaa sparkled on the silver screen. She acted in 142 films from 1964 to 1980 in the Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi and English languages. Of these 77 films ran for over 100 days and 18 for more than 25 weeks. Her last  feature film in Tamil was \u2018Nadhiyai Thedi Vandha Kadal\u2019.",
    "Jayalalithaa\u2019s first Tamil film \u2018Vennira Aadai\u2019 made history even before it was released by getting an \u2018A\u2019 certificate as an adults only film. Apparently the Film Certification Board was upset by some shots of Jayalalithaa bathing and dancing in the film. The movie when released ran successfully for over a hundred days in several theatres. Jayalalithaa got rave reviews. Thousands became her fans overnight. A star was born! A fragrant sign of this stardom was in posing for advertisements extolling the virtues of Lux soap.",
    "Jayalalithaa\u2019s second Tamil film was \u2018Aayirathil Oruvanor\u2019  where she first played the leading lady to MG Ramachandran known as MGR. It  was a block buster. MGR was 48 years old and Jayalalithaa only 17. Despite the 31-year age difference the pair hit it off grandly on screen. More films followed and the duo made 28  films together in nine years. Almost every film was a commercial success. The jewel in the crown was \u2018Adimai Penn\u2019 or slave girl with Jayalalithaa in a dual role. The film released in 1969 was produced by MGR himself.",
    "It was in this film that Jayalalithaa sang in her own voice for the first time on screen. It so happened that MGR once heard Jayalalithaa singing softly by herself and felt she sang well. So a solo was given to her in \u2018Adimai Penn\u2019. The song \u2018Amma Endraal Anbu\u2019 was written by lyricist Vaali and music composed by K.V. Mahadevan. She had a creamy, croony voice and the song got popular. She sang in her own voice in some other films too. Jayalalithaa\u2019s first screen song began with the word \u201cAmma\u201dYears later millions of supporters started  calling her \u201cAmma\u201d!",
    "The immensely-popular MGR had a network of fan clubs known as Rasikar Mandram. Though several actresses  have  paired with MGR, it was Jayalalithaa who captured the hearts of his fans. MGR\u2019s wife Janaki was called \u201cAnni,\u201d meaning wife of the elder brother by fans, who also referred to Jayalalithaa as \u201cSinna (small) Anni\u201d. MGR himself was infatuated with her. Though they never formally married, Jayalalithaa was regarded as the love of MGR\u2019s life.",
    "In spite of her unofficial liaison with MGR, the actor to whom Jayalalithaa was linked romantically was Telugu actor Sobhan Babu. He was however married and refused to divorce his wife formally and marry Jayalalithaa. Once when a Tamil magazine had a gossip article about this relationship, Jayalalithaa wrote an open letter to the publication in which she stated that both of them were in love and would marry if and when Sobhan Babu divorced his wife. That never happened and  Jayalalithaa remained  single and was  referred to as  \u201cSelvi\u201d  or unmarried woman.",
    "Though she played glamorous roles, she was a good actress and made an impression if given challenging roles with scope to display histrionic ability. She exuded chic and \u00e9lan in her film career and was a favourite among teens of that era. She designed many of her costumes and was a trendsetter in fashion for young women.",
    "Jayalalithaa was one of the first heroines to don bathing costumes on screen and was described as a bombshell in bikini.Among her successful films in Tamil were \u2018Adimai Penn,\u2019 \u2018Naan,\u2019 \u2018Maatukkaara Velan,\u2019 \u2018Aathiparasakthi,\u2019 \u2018Pattikaadaa Pattanamaa,\u2019 \u2018Kavalkaran,\u2019 \u2018Engiruntho Vanthaal,\u2019 \u2018Kumari Penn,\u2019 \u2018Kandhan Karunai,\u2019 \u2018Nam Naadu,\u2019 \u2018Chandrothayam,\u2019 \u2018Kudiyiruntha Koavil,\u2019 \u2018Engal Thangam,\u2019 \u2018Enga Maamaa,\u2019 \u2018Suryakanthi,\u2019 \u2018Avan Thaan Manithan,\u2019 etc.",
    "Apart from MGR, Jayalalithaa acted opposite stars such as Sivaji Ganesan, Gemini Ganesan, Jaishankar, Ravichandran, Muthuraman, A.V.M. Rajan, N.T. Rama Rao, A. Nageswara Rao, Krishna, Sobhan Babu, Rajkumar and Kalyankumar.",
    "An accomplished dancer, she lit up the screen and stage by her performances. Her dance drama, \u2018Kaviri Thantha Kalaichelvi,\u2019 was a smashing success. Jayalalithaa was versatile. She has been a magazine columnist, short story writer, novelist and film producer.",
    "Let the last word about her splendid acting career be in the words of her arch enemy in politics Muttuvel Karunanidhi, the late  DMK leader and former Tamil Nadu chief minister.",
    "The movie \u2018Thirumangalyam\u2019 released in January 1974 was Jayalalithaa\u2019s 100th film. There was a felicitation ceremony where the Chief Minister at the time, Karunanidhi, was the Guest of Honour.",
    "Recalling that his late leader C.N. Annadurai had once described actress Bhanumathy as \u201cNadippukku Ilakkanam Vahuthavar\u201d (devised the grammar of acting), Karunanidhi praised Jayalalithaa in similar vein as \u201cNadippukku ilakkiam vahuthavar,\u201d which meant \u201cdevised literature in acting\u201d.",
    "There came  a time when MGR and Jayalalithaa got  estranged chiefly due to the Sobhan Babu affair. . While Jayalalithaa faded away from the screen, MGR formed his own political party the AIADMK  and became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. After a few years of separation there was rapprochement between both. MGR enticed her into his party and launched her on a successful political career.",
    "MGR   brought her into politics in 1982. After entering politics Jayalalithaa became the ADMK\u2019s propaganda and later administrative secretary. She was a Rajya Sabha MP in 1984. In 1989 she entered Tamil Nadu legislature as an elected MLA.",
    "After MGR\u2019s death in 1987, the ADMK founded by Ramachandran split, with his wife Janaki and paramour Jayalalithaa leading the two factions. Jayalalithaa triumphed and the party united under her leadership to sweep the polls in 1991. Thereafter she became  the imperious yet undisputed leader of the AIADMK until her illness and demise.",
    "Few in her party dared  to call her by name and so she was \u201cAmma,\u201d \u201cMadam\u201d or \u201cThalaivi.\u201d Since MGR was called \u201cPuratchi Thalaiver,\u201d or revolutionary leader, Jayalalithaa was addressed by its feminine equivalent, \u201cPuratchi Thalaivi.\u201d Like MGR, she too was called \u201cIthaya Deivam\u201d (God  of the Heart).",
    "Many in the AIADMK began  treating  her as a living deity .At least one of her former ministers  used to pat  his cheeks reverentially when referring to her. Some ministers have gone on record saying their ambition in life was to be her servant or be a watchdog in her kennel.",
    "Years ago in a movie called Thanipiravi MGR played Lord Muruga and Jayalalithaa his consort Valli, in a dream sequence. A picture of both together as Murugan and Valli was framed and worshipped by many. Likewise, Jayalalithaa has played divine roles in many other films too. Pictures of Jayalalithaa in such roles were hung in many dwellings. Some people  even  lit camphor and laid flowers before them. Once Sycophants went to the extent of depicting her as the Madonna in posters. Enraged Catholics protested and the posters were removed.",
    "Falling at her feet or touching them as a mark of respect was almost a ritual for many of her followers. Touching or falling at the feet of elders to seek their blessings is customary in India. But in the case of Jayalalithaa, party sycophants took  this practice to ridiculous levels.",
    "Even party veterans older than Jayalalithaa prostrated themselves publicly. An amusing  sycophantic phenomenon were  the nauseating  references to her feet by party members when they   commenced  their speeches.",
    "In a disgusting spectacle they began by paying homage to her \u201cpotpaadangal\u201d (golden feet) or \u201cthamaraithiruvadigal\u201d (lotus feet). Like Imelda Marcos of the Philipines, Jayalalithaa herself had a fascination for footwear. There have been media reports and pictures of her 800 plus shoes, sandals and slippers.",
    "DMK Leader and former Chief Minister \u201cKalaigner\u201d Karunanidhi when in the opposition took a potshot at this practice of AIADMK  Party members falling at  Jayalalithaa\u2019s feet. The AIADMK an off-shoot of the DMK was a Dravidian party supposedly opposed to \u201cBrahminism\u201d. Yer these so called Dravidian party stalwarts were grovelling at this Brahmin woman\u2019s feet. So Karunanidhi  in his inimitable alliterative style  referred to  Jayalalithaa\u2019s feet as \u201cVaedangalukku Nigaraana Jayalalithaavin Paadangal\u201d (Jayalalithaa\u2019s feet are equal to the scriptures)",
    "Once Jayalalithaa  was questioned by a North Indian journalist about this \u201cfalling at her feet\u201d practice and asked  her why she did not put a stop to it. She replied that her supporters were doing so voluntarily due to their affectionate regard for her and that she was unable to prevent it.This was not correct because it is well-known that she liked it and encouraged it. Jayalalithaa also utilised this act to humiliate people.",
    "In one instance a man who had left her party and criticised her returned to its folds again. The media was called in to witness the return of the prodigal. This man, K.K.S.R. Ramachandran, was a big-made man with a very big moustache. He was required to prostrate himself four times before a smilingly-seated Jayalalithaa under the pretext that the photographers had not got a good shot. The picture was released to all papers.",
    "Interestingly enough this penchant for Jayalalithaa\u2019s feet was shared even by her mentor and paramour. According to some observers, MGR had some kind of a foot fetish for Jayalalithaa. In many of the films in which they acted together, there were scenes of MGR touching Jayalalithaa\u2019s feet such as removing a thorn from her sole or massaging a sprained ankle. Apparently the man who founded the ADMK had a fixation on her feet. Later members of MGR\u2019s party  seem to hare  followed their leader by being at Jayalalithaa\u2019s feet.",
    "Jayalalithaa has  often been  criticised for her arrogance. She was virtually a dominatrix with party people and treated  them like her minions and serfs. At t times, Jayalalithaa would be the only person sitting on a stage while others would remain standing or seated on the floor.",
    "Later she dispensed with this practice but allowed  only selected persons  to sit next to her. When a senior Minister, Munu Aathi, dared to sit next to her at a function, she flared up and publicly ordered him to move back.",
    "On another occasion a Congress cabinet minister from Tamil Nadu tried to sit next to her on a flight to New Delhi. She shouted at him to get lost and referred derisively to his caste. The man was a Dalit. There was a big outcry and a public apology was demanded. She did not budge.",
    "During  inner meetings of the party she remained seated while the rest sat on the floor or remained standing. There have been press conferences where her ministers stood behind her with folded hands while she sat on a sofa.Later she stopped doing this.",
    "However there was  no inner party democracy in the AIADMK. Jayalalithaa appointed, removed, transferred, promoted, demoted, expelled and recruited  at her own discretion. Ministers were appointed, fired or shuffled according to her whims. Her wish was the party\u2019s command. None dared to disobey let alone defy. She was an autocrat who did not tolerate criticism. She looked  down upon the media and brooked  no dissent.",
    "While her haughty demeanour and arrogant attitude deserved to be condemned, there was perhaps a rationale for such behaviour. The ascendancy of Jayalalithaa in a Tamil Nadu milieu could  be viewed as an ironic contradiction to the norms prevailing in the state.",
    "Despite the breeze of cosmopolitanism blowing in through globalisation, the state of Tamil Nadu is basically conservative. It is a patriarchal, male-dominated society with strict notions of a woman\u2019s role and place \u2013 Jayalalithaa was a woman.",
    "Tamil Nadu society at large has contempt for women actors in the cine field who do not behave as \u2018good\u2019 women should. Woman film stars, in spite of their glamour, are not respected and regarded with disdain in private \u2013 Jayalalithaa was an actress.",
    "The dominant political ideology in the state is that of Dravidianism. This is based on archaic concepts of the Aryan-Dravidian divide where the Brahmin community is seen as Aryans and other Tamils as Dravidians. Anti-Brahminism is a core element of Dravidian discourse \u2013 Jayalalithaa was a Brahmin.",
    "Thus, one can see that the Jayalalithaa phenomenon went  against the grain of three dominant concepts in Tamil Nadu. She was a woman, a film star and a Brahmin. The success of this embodiment in the socio-political realm of Tamil Nadu was a contradiction. Jayalalithaa, in a way, was an exception or aberration.",
    "In that context, the situation could have  been quite dicey for her. If she were to be democratic and easygoing, the people surrounding her may have  exploited  it to their advantage. Instead of appreciating her conduct, they would very likely have regarded  it as a weakness and taken  advantage.",
    "When she entered politics, many party members were dazzled by her beauty and easy accessibility. They were extra-attentive to her and ever ready to make physical contact. A regional leader from Madurai called \u201cPazhakkadai\u201d Pandi went ballistic once on stage. He was reprimanded by MGR. Thereafter the order went out from MGR that Jayalalithaa should be treated with reverence. This changed the situation. Soon party people  began showing great subservience to her. Slowly she was promoted as a superior, cult figure.",
    "After MGR\u2019s death Jayalalithaa was quite vulnerable.An Indian editor once told me of an incident that happened in 1988. The ADMK had split after MGR\u2019s death and both factions were trying to take control of the party headquarters building. When Jayalalithaa joined demonstrators party supporters mobbed her.",
    "Sadly , she had to be rescued by the Police from her own supporters. Jayalalithaa used to wear pure white sarees with a thin border then. The Indian editor told me that her Saree and blouse were full of grubby finger marks. Apparently her supporters had used the opportunity to try and fondle her or squeeze her. In later life she had her own set of bodyguards known as the \u201cpoonaipadai\u201d(Cat force)to prevent supporters from getting close to her.",
    "Jayalalithaa perhaps realised that  she had to assert unquestionable superiority over her party people to remain in control. Superiority and not equality was necessary. The followers had to be put in place as inferiors. This she began to do vigorously.",
    "Soon she became an authoritative figure. She grew into her role and her inherent traits of arrogance  and domination came to the fore. She humiliated her followers to show who was boss and trampled them underfoot. Incredible as it may seem, they seem to like it, with even highly educated professionals paying pooja horizontally to the brahmin boss lady.",
    "This state of affairs may help to understand the reasons for her arrogant conduct but it certainly cannot condone it. Moreover, there was a vicious, vindictive streak to her that often manifests itself in controversial ways.",
    "There was a woman administrative officer (IAS), Chandralekha, with whom she had a disagreement. Soon acid was thrown by goondas on Chandralekha\u2019s face. As Chief Minister she abused her authority and incarcerated her rival, Karunanidhi. The Police carried the howling man away.",
    "Due to a dispute with the Kachipuram \u201cSangara madam\u201d Holy seer Sri Jayendra Swamigal, Jayalalithaa went to the extent of getting him arrested on what seemed to be false charges.",
    "When maverick politico Dr. Subramaniam Swamy fell foul of her, Jayalalithaa organised a hostile reception for him in Chennai. Members of the ADMK Women\u2019s League raised their sarees in a protest demonstration. \u201cSubramanian Swamy has met his waterloo,\u201d gloated Jayalalithaa publicly. \u201cI will send Jayalalithaa to the loo without water,\u201d retorted Swamy.",
    "Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was taken ill on 22 September 2016 and admitted to Apollo Hospital in Chennai. On 4 December 2016 she suffered a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Apollo. Her condition was critical and she was put on life support. She passed away on 5 December 2016.",
