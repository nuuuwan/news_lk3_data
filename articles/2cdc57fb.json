    "Colombo, April 30 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is the only party that will conduct its May Day rally at a playground, maintaining tradition, while other political parties have been unable to secure similar venues, SLPP General Secretary MP Sagara Kariyawasam said.",
    "Speaking to the media, he noted that previously, political parties held their May Day rallies on playgrounds, but this year, the SLPP has garnered the greatest support and trust to conduct their rally at such a venue.",
    "\"Regrettably, political parties other than the SLPP were compelled to conduct their May Day rallies on the streets, indicative of their limitations. The Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) were constrained to hold their rallies on the road, with some starting from playgrounds but concluding on the streets. This tactic often led to road closures, as they aimed to create the illusion of massive crowds,\" MP Kariyawasam said.",
    "He said that as the SLPP, they urge other parties to strive to strengthen their position and hold their May Day rallies at least on playgrounds.",
    "\"Respectfully, the SLPP is expected to lead the May Day rally as the most dominant party on the ground. We also appeal to the public to unite with fellow patriots at the May Day rally, demonstrating their love for the country,\" MP Kariyawasam added."
