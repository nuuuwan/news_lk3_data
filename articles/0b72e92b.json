    "Exterminators PLC, a leading innovator in digital pest management and environmental enhancement technology, is excited to announce its strategic decision to franchise its cutting-edge digital pest management franchise system in technical collaboration with Sentario UK Limited and strategic partnership with Pest Scan BV, Netherlands, and Futura GMBH, Germany, across 14 districts in Sri Lanka. The expansion will focus on the Northern, Eastern, North Central, and Uva provinces, as well as the Rathnapura and Puttalam districts. The company\u2019s vision is to transform the pest management industry through digitalisation and automation powered by artificial intelligence, while ensuring a balance between people, planet, profit, and mission, and its mission is to provide innovative and effective pest management solutions that are environmentally sustainable, significantly reducing reliance on traditional chemical-based methods through advanced technology and targeted treatments. Additionally, this initiative will significantly contribute to restoring the degraded ecosystem by creating an environment that encourages the return of dragonflies, fish, frogs, and bats. They also play a vital role in reducing mosquito populations since they feed on mosquitoes and their larvae.",
    "Exterminators PLC Chairman Dr. Kishu Gomes stated the need for greater reach to capitalise on the emerging business opportunities in distant districts was felt more than ever before following the economic recovery seen in the country which led to the expansion of the SME sector especially in manufacturing and tourism. The strategic decision taken will not only help Exterminator PLC drive its business growth but also help the potential clients to take measures to preserve their assets while ensuring food safety and hygiene for the benefit of all stakeholders depending on the category of business. Exterminators PLC Founder and Managing Director Marlon Ferreira stated, \u201cEntering these 14 districts, where we currently have minimal revenue just 5 percent, represents a significant growth opportunity. The competitive landscape, which includes around 150 licensed companies primarily located in Colombo and Gampaha, presents an opportunity for us to fill a market gap and capture valuable market share.",
    "The franchise model will generate revenue through initial franchise fees, ongoing royalties, and the sale of supplies to franchisees. \u201cOur financial projections suggest we can achieve rapid breakeven with just one franchise signing up, significantly minimising investment risk,\u201d Ferreira added. \u201cInstead of establishing branches ourselves\u2014a high-risk, costly investment\u2014developing successful franchises is a more viable option that reduces financial risks and allows for adjustments along the way.\u201d Ferreira further emphasised that this strategic move will not only benefit the company but will also create substantial value for shareholders and stakeholders alike. Expanding into new districts will lead to increased employment opportunities, community engagement, and local economic growth. By empowering franchisees, Exterminators PLC will foster entrepreneurship while providing innovative pest management solutions tailored to local communities. \u201cWith our focus on digitisation, we aim to streamline operations and enhance customer satisfaction. Technology will enable us and our franchisees to track pest issues in real-time, analyse data for preventive measures, and utilise environmentally friendly methods,\u201d Ferreira explained.",
    "Benefits to the franchise included well-known brand recognition, comprehensive support to franchisees to ensure their success. This includes training programs, marketing resources, and operational guidance, allowing for consistent brand representation in addition to digitalisation and automation of the entire sales, market, and operations process. Product and services offered include AI-powered pest management solutions, remote rodent monitoring bait stations, digital flying insect killers, preventive pest management solutions, food plant pest management solutions, scheduled maintenance programs, consulting services for pest management, educational workshops, and training for client. The company will establish a training academy to maintain high service standards among franchisees, including three weeks of training at the Exterminators PLC headquarters. One week of on-the-job training at franchise locations in a 24-hour call centre will be set up at the headquarters to address customer needs and queries. The plan to expand internationally into Seychelles and the Maldives aligns with Exterminators PLC\u2019s vision of global growth, allowing the company to address unique pest challenges in these regions effectively. Exterminators PLC is poised to reshape the pest management landscape in Sri Lanka and beyond, driving revenue growth, creating sustainable practices, and enhancing shareholder and stakeholder value through constant innovation."
