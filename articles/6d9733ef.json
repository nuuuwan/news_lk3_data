    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s consumer prices in the capital Colombo rose 2.4 percent in the 12-months to July 2024 but the central bank has created only 2.8 percent in the 22 months since its deflationary policy started to show up in the balance of payments in September 2022.",
    "The Colombo Consumer Price Index fell 0.5 index points to 194.7 points in the month of July. The index is now slightly below the level seen in December 2023.",
    "The central bank has generally kept the exchange rate stable, while collecting reserves and reducing its domestic assets to run deflationary policy. Exchange rate became volatile after a build up excess liquidity from dollar purchases in June.",
    "The food and non-alcoholic beverage sub-index rose 0.1 percent in July after rising 2.8 percent a month earlier. The housing and electricity index fell 1.5 percent to 142.9 points.",
    "Exchange rate stability has also boosted profits of the Ceylon Electricity Board and allowed it to cut rates.",
    "Global coal prices have also eased amid tighter US policy. Oil prices also stabilized or fallen, despite attempts by OPEC to cut production and push up prices.",
    "However, in most International Monetary Fund backed countries, currencies depreciated due to anchor conflicts coming from flexible inflation targeting or crawling pegs denying any benefits from US tightening and triggering social unrest as food and energy prices rise."
