  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has reduced a 65 rupee per kilo import tax on rice to 1 rupee to import some rice to control high domestic prices, after trade minister Nalin Fernando said millers and collectors were driving up the high price of rice due to lack of free trade.",
    "A gazette notice signed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe says the reduction of Special Commodity Levy will be effective from January 02 to January 21, 2024.",
    "Sri Lanka controls the import of rice to keep domestic prices artificially high.",
    "Though there is criticism of value added tax, there is usually no criticism of taxes imposed on basic food for economic nationalism.",
    "There are also economic nationalism taxes as well as import duties on maize, which pushes up animal feed prices, chicken, egg and dairy products."
