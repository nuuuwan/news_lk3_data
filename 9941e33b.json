  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013  Sri Lanka\u2019s Central Bank chief has disclosed for the first time how warnings of an impending calamity were ignored by the then administration led by president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "Nandalal Weerasinghe said he had predicted the impending economic catastrophe three years ago due to the so called Modern Monetary Theory and the \u201chomegrown solution\u201d of the previous administration of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cI saw this crisis was coming,\u201d he said adding that he had serious concerns about the monetary policy of the central bank at the time.",
    "In a wide-ranging interview with AFP in Colombo, Weerasinghe said he was side-lined for warning of the dangers of the path the central bank was taking at the time and for his troubles, he was forced to take early retirement in September 2021.",
    "\u201cAs the head of the Monetary Policy Committee at the time, as the senior deputy governor, I always raised concerns. And there were differences.",
    "\u201cBut we as central bankers never came out with those internal disagreements with the management and also with the government in terms of policies.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn fact, I should say, not only me, the staff of the central bank, the professional staff, always raised  this concern even after I left. \u2026 but those were not heard, not accepted, there was a kind of a different ideology coming from the Central Bank top as well as from outside, what we called a \u2018home grown solution.\u2019",
    "\u201cAnd as I remember, there was a six-month roadmap announced by the Central Bank. Completely unrealistic with false assumption, false expectations, and that ended up with reserves being ended up as almost nothing in April.",
    "\u201cCentral bankers obviously knew what was going on. They expressed concern, but you know, the fear culture, and the rules and regulation is that although you can internally raise all issues and discuss, but no one can go out. And obviously, it\u2019s difficult for a central banker to have the courage and go out and speak out outside the framework.\u201d",
    "He said it was \u201cobvious\u201d that if the government continued with its policies of \u201cexcessive monetary financing, suppressing interest rates, bad exchange rate policy, fixing at one rate for a long period, running down our reserves,\u201d the country would head for disaster.",
    "He said he privately voiced his concerns and noted that what happened between May and July last year was exactly as he had feared.",
    "As the country was gripped with an unprecedented shortage of foreign exchange, angry street protests over economic mismanagement, Rajapaksa turned to Weerasinghe to salvage the situation.",
    "\u201cI never had an intention to come back to the central bank or public service\u2026I thought I would have a good retirement life,\u201d he said.  He was spending time with his children in Brisbane, Australia and playing golf five days of the week when he got the invitation to return as the head of the Central Bank.",
    "He said there would have been many others too who could have taken the job, but he decided to accept the challenge when he was invited but set his conditions demanding independence and a finance secretary (Mahinda Siriwardena) he could work with.",
    "When Rajapaksa took over in November 2019, the country had over seven billion dollars in reserves, but when Weerasinghe took over the Central Bank the useable reserves were just 25 million. Days later, Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion foreign debt.",
    "Weerasinghe said the more difficult part of salvaging Sri Lanka economy will be the restructure of domestic debt while navigating a political minefield.",
    "\u201cThis is the most challenging part of debt restructuring. It is very politically sensitive, socially sensitive and also there is some impact on domestic (bond) holders,\u201d he told AFP.",
    "He urged all members of parliament to exercise their duty to safeguard public finances by supporting the debt restructure efforts as the alternative would be catastrophic for the entire nation.",
    "He stressed that the country must vigorously pursue the reforms such as ensuring accountability, stability of policy and good governance without falling off the wagon again at the first sign of stability.",
    "The country could get back to economic normality within two to four years if it stuck to the IMF program.",
    "The new government has doubled taxes and removed subsidies \u2014 both highly unpopular moves \u2014 to be in line with revenue targets set by the IMF.",
    "He notes that Sri Lanka\u2019s track record with the International Monetary Fund was \u201cnot good\u201d because the island had gone to the Washington-based lender 16 times before, but failed to stick with agreed reforms.",
    "\u201cBut this time, the 17th time with the IMF is different. It is not only a balance of payment crisis, but a debt crisis coming together at once,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf you are trying to go back to another (IMF) program, that will be most difficult, and I think that will be the end of the story.",
    "\u201cSo basically, there\u2019s no excuse this time, no second chance, you have to get it right this time.\u201d",
    "Last week, Weerasinghe unveiled Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring plan offering a 30 percent haircut to international sovereign bond holders, a nine year moratorium on repayments to bilateral lenders.",
    "More than half of Sri Lanka\u2019s bilateral debt is owed to China. Weerasinghe rejects allegations that Beijing was holding up a debt restructure deal crucial to continuing with the $2.9 billion IMF bailout.",
    "\u201cThe way China is dealing with this process is different because they are a new kind of creditor in the global sense.  We expect some delays because China is a new player.  So China will take its time, but China is fully on board, and agreed to support Sri Lanka and help Sri Lanka to come out of this crisis.\u201d",
    "China has not joined a \u201ccommon platform\u201d initiated by Japan and which involve s India and the Paris Club of creditors. However, Colombo insists it will have bilateral talks with Beijing but in the end all creditors will be offered comparable terms with no one getting a better deal than what is offered to others. (COLOMBO/July 7/2023)"
