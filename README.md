### White House says firings ‘imminent’ as plan to reopen government collapses

Efforts to swiftly end the US government shutdown collapsed Wednesday (Oct 1) as Democrats in Congress went home without resolving a funding stand-off with President Donald Trump - and the White House threatened public sector jobs.

Federal funding expired at midnight after Trump and lawmakers failed to agree on a deal to keep the lights on, prompting agencies to wind down services, while the White House warned of “imminent” firings of public sector workers.

Senate Democrats - who are demanding extended health care subsidies for low-income families - refused to help the majority Republicans approve a House-passed Bill that would have reopened the government for several weeks while negotiations continue.

Voting in the Senate is now adjourned until Friday, meaning hopes for a quick resolution have been frustrated.

Around 750,000 federal employees are expected to be placed on furlough - a kind of enforced leave, with pay withheld until they return to work.

### Former Congolese president sentenced to death for war crimes

Former Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila has been sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes and treason.

The charges concern accusations that Kabila has been supporting the M23, a rebel group who have wreaked devastation across the country’s eastern region.

Kabila was convicted on Friday by a military court of treason, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, including murder, sexual assault, torture and insurrection. He denied the charges, but did not appear in court to defend himself.

The ex-president rejected the case as “arbitrary” and said the courts were being used as an “instrument of oppression”. His current whereabouts are unknown.

One of his allies and a former minister, Kikaya Bin Karubi, told the BBC’s Newsday programme that the whole trial had been “theatrical” and was an example of the dictatorship of President Félix Tshisekedi. He said the court had not seen any evidence linking Kabila to the M23 rebel group.

Mannar: Multiethnic, multilingual, multireligious protests against ecological and livelihood destruction

Two former Navy chiefs whose wartime background was in naval intelligence, are incarcerated. The Government insists that it doesn’t decide to arrest anyone and that any such decisions are not taken by the political authorities but have been and are being taken quite independently by state authorities, i.e., state machinery that has been newly rendered independent by the NPP government.

If so, isn’t it a little odd that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made the following announcement to an audience of Sri Lankans in New York City?

‘…President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday bomb attacks are continuing and advancing and that one or two former Army officials are expected to be arrested over the incident…

…”Several former military officials are to be arrested soon and investigations are both continuing and advancing.”…’

The Israeli navy has intercepted boats carrying aid to Gaza and detained the activists aboard, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry said several vessels that form part of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) had been “safely stopped” and that those aboard were being transferred to an Israeli port.

It added that the navy had told the vessels to change course as they were “approaching an active combat zone”.

The GSF described the interception as “illegal” and “not an act of defence” but “a brazen act of desperation”.

The group has alleged that one vessel within the flotilla was “deliberately rammed at sea” and said additional boats were hit by water cannons.

“It clearly reveals the extreme lengths to which the occupier will go to ensure Gaza remains starved and isolated,” GSF wrote on social media.

“They will attack a peaceful civilian mission because the success of humanitarian aid means the failure of their siege.”

### Fitch confirms Sri Lanka CCC+ sovereign rating

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka’s CCC+ sovereign rating saying external finances are stable, and growth is resuming despite US tariffs.

“We expect full-year growth at 4.4 percent, with 3.8 percent in 2026 and 3.6 percent in 2027,” the rating agency said.

“US tariffs will be a growth headwind, but the revised reciprocal tariff rate of 20 percent is now in line with peers, reducing risks to exports.

“We see low average inflation, but to rise gradually to 5 percent in 2027, in line with the CBSL’s inflation target.”

Sri Lanka’s macro-economists created a series of currency crises with its 5 percent inflation target, ousted two elected administrations and triggered a sovereign default using inflationary open market operations and buy-sell swaps to inject money, critics have said.
