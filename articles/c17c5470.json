    "US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has asserted that the United States will continue to monitor legislative developments in Sri Lanka that could challenge its progress on human rights, reconciliation, and civic space.",
    "Taking to \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter), the diplomat highlighted that the joint statement issued by the Core Group earlier this month at the 55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), along with other statements made by local and international organizations, underscore shared concerns, notably that Sri Lanka\u2019s much-disputed Online Safety Act could be used to criminalize a wide range of expression, suppress dissent, and undermine Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy.",
    "Speaking in this vein, Ambassador Chung urged for comprehensive consultations to be made between the Government of Sri Lanka and other stakeholders, including civil society, prior to the enactment of any legislation with potentially serious implications for fundamental freedoms and civic space in the future, and that the due legislative process be followed in this regard.",
    "On 04 March, the Core Group on Sri Lanka, at the 55th Session of the UHRC raised concerns with regards to several legislative developments regarding human rights, reconciliation and civic space.",
    "In a joint statement, the Core Group, comprising of Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, noted that certain legislative developments imposed recently have given cause for concern.",
    "As such, they noted\u00a0that the Online Safety Act has \u201cthe potential to severely restrict online communication, and could potentially criminalise nearly all forms of expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression\u201d.",
    "Thus, the Core Group urged the Sri Lankan Government to enact amendments to align the Act with Sri Lanka\u2019s human rights obligations and commitments.",
    "Speaking further, the Group reiterated their concerns surrounding the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), continuing to call for it to be replaced with legislation that is consistent with Sri Lanka\u2019s international obligations.",
    "Attached below is the full statement issued by the Core Group at the 55th Session of the UNHRC:",
    "This statement is on behalf of the Sri Lanka Core Group comprising Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia, the United Kingdom and the United States.",
    "There have been several important legislative developments regarding human rights, reconciliation and civic space. Unfortunately, some of these developments give cause for concern.",
    "The Online Safety Act has the potential to severely restrict online communication, and could potentially criminalise nearly all forms of expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression. We urge the Government to enact amendments to align the Act with Sri Lanka\u2019s human rights obligations and commitments.",
    "We continue to call for the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be replaced with legislation that is consistent with Sri Lanka\u2019s international obligations. We acknowledge the recent release of nine Tamil leaders detained last November.\u00a0 We encourage the release of unjustly held long-term PTA detainees and for Sri Lanka to maintain a moratorium on its use.",
    "While we note the Government\u2019s efforts to establish a Commission on Truth, Unity and Reconciliation we stress the importance of an inclusive participatory process to build trust in advance of any legislation. Any future Commission must be independent, inclusive, meaningful, and transparent, meet the expectations of affected communities, build upon previous transitional justice processes, and provide pathways for accountability.",
    "As the Government brings forward other legislation with potentially serious implications for fundamental freedoms and civic space, we encourage comprehensive consultations with stakeholders, including civil society, and due legislative process.",
    "We welcome the Government\u2019s stated commitments on land releases but note with concern reports of increased tensions around land seizures in the North and, particularly, the East of the country.",
    "High Commissioner, we urge the Government to engage with you and your office to address these and other challenges, and we remain ready to support Sri Lanka in addressing HRC resolution 51/1."
