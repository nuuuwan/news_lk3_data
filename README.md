*2024-12-03 13:45:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-develop-galle-harbour-calls-for-public-comments-on-eia-127954/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has called for public feedback on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report on the land reclamation to be done under the proposed Galle harbour development project.

The EIA report is available on the official website of the Department of Coastal Conservation.

Public can provide feedback for a period of one month, a government statement said.

Proposals to develop the natural harbour located in the south-western coast of the island as a commercial and tourist port were first made two years ago.

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority’s proposed development includes providing a fully fledged yacht marina to attract more yachts.

These include berthing facilities to passenger vessels of 300m in length and cargo vessels of 200m in length which have a depth of 10m and 10.9m respectively, the SLPA has said. (Colombo/Dec3/2024)
