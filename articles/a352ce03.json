  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a move to enhance international cooperation in criminal justice, the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved two key agreements between Sri Lanka and the Republic of the Philippines to strengthen legal collaboration and prisoner rehabilitation.",
    "The first agreement focuses on mutual legal cooperation in criminal matters, which involves assistance between the two States in delivering judicial documents, collecting evidence, and facilitating criminal investigations and prosecutions.",
    "Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa noted that formalising such cooperation will help curb cross-border criminal activities while ensuring more effective suppression of offenders.",
    "In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers also approved the signing of an extradition agreement on sentenced persons.",
    "Under the provisions of Sri Lanka\u2019s Extradition Act, No. 5 of 1995, the pact will allow citizens sentenced to imprisonment in either country to be transferred to their home country to serve the remainder of their sentences. Dr. Jayatissa announcing the decision emphasised that this measure not only enables judicial efficiency, but also provides opportunities for social rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders within their own societies.",
    "He said both decisions are expected to mark an important step in reinforcing bilateral ties with the Philippines in the areas of justice, law enforcement, and criminal rehabilitation.",
    "Both agreements, proposed by Justice and National Integration Minister Harshana Nanayakkara, were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."
