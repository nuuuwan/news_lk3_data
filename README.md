### From Opposition Stand To Government Policy: The NPP’s Reversal On PC Delimitation

The trajectory of Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) on the question of Provincial Council (PC) elections underscores how political priorities shift with the assumption of state power. Once, as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the party spearheaded the rejection of delimitation. Today, with a commanding two-thirds majority in Parliament, the NPP has recommitted to the very process it once condemned—announcing at the United Nations Human Rights Council (OHCHR) today that PC elections will only be held once a new delimitation exercise is complete.

In 2017, the UNP–SLFP coalition amended the law to introduce a mixed electoral system for PCs. A Delimitation Committee led by K. Thavalingam was tasked with redrawing electoral boundaries.
