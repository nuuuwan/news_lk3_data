    "In Sri Lanka, despite a multitude of problems, democracy\u00a0 still survives. Traditionally the norms of democracy are the Presidency,\u00a0 Parliament, the Judiciary and the Free Media. For democracy to thrive,\u00a0 the spirit of humanitarianism is also needed. This often comes out of\u00a0 spirituality that brings love, joy, peace patience and kindness,\u00a0 humility, meekness, faithfulness and kindness. To what extent\u00a0 humanitarian thrive in Sri Lanka cannot be calculated, but we know and\u00a0 have experienced that our care for others is a measure of our greatness.\u00a0 Without this care, we often act with selfish self-centred motives or\u00a0 personal gain or glory.",
    "On August 19 the United Nations marks World Humanitarian\u00a0 Day. In a statement, the UN says there is a saying that goes: It takes a\u00a0 village to raise a child. Similarly, it takes a village to support a\u00a0 person in a humanitarian crisis. With record-high humanitarian needs\u00a0 around the world, this year\u2019s World Humanitarian Day (WHD) builds on\u00a0 this metaphor of collective endeavour to grow global appreciation of\u00a0 humanitarian work",
    "According to the UN, whenever and wherever people are in\u00a0 need, there are others who help them. They are the affected people\u00a0 themselves \u2013 always first to respond when disaster strikes \u2013 and a\u00a0 global community that supports them as they recover. Far from the\u00a0 spotlight and out of the headlines, they come together to ease suffering\u00a0 and bring hope.",
    "The 2022 WHD campaign shines a light on the thousands of\u00a0 volunteers, professionals and crisis-affected people who deliver urgent\u00a0 health care, shelter, food, protection, water and much more. The UN says\u00a0 it believes will use digital art to tell the stories of people in need\u00a0 and those who help them. At the centre of the campaign is a series of\u00a0 beautifully illustrated aid worker profiles that show the breadth and\u00a0 depth of humanitarian work and collectively symbolize the wider\u00a0 humanitarian village.",
    "On August 19, 2003, a bomb attack on the Canal Hotel at\u00a0 Baghdad in Iraq, killed 22 humanitarian aid workers including the UN\u00a0 Secretary General\u2019s Special Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello. Five\u00a0 years later, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution\u00a0 designating August 19 as World Humanitarian Day (WHD).",
    "Each year, WHD focuses on a theme, bringing together\u00a0 partners from across the humanitarian system to advocate for the\u00a0 survival, well-being and dignity of people affected by crises and for\u00a0 the safety and security of aid workers.",
    "For this year\u2019s WHD, the UN shows the importance, effectiveness and positive impact of humanitarian work.",
    "In 2021, 460 aid workers were attacked: 140 killed, 203 wounded and 117 kidnapped.",
    "Of the aid workers who died, 98% were national staff and 2%\u00a0 were international (expatriate) staff - more than half (53%) were staff\u00a0 of national NGOs.",
    "Most of the violence took place in South Sudan, Afghanistan and Syria.",
    "Casualties are expected to rise significantly in 2022 due\u00a0 to the war in Ukraine, where rocket attacks and shelling threaten\u00a0 civilians and aid providers equally.",
    "The 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview estimated that 20.7\u00a0 million (67% of the population) people need humanitarian assistance,\u00a0 12.1 million of whom are estimated to be in acute need, which makes\u00a0 Yemen the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, the UN says.",
    "In Sri Lanka, we need to form communities or associations\u00a0 that bring together humanitarian workers who are ready to assist and\u00a0 even give their lives to save others. Whatever our politicians do or do\u00a0 not do whatever the level of corruption including politicians and their\u00a0 cronies if the people act with a spirit of goodwill we will have a just\u00a0 and fair society where issues; like such as poverty alleviation, climate\u00a0 change and crisis-resolution could be handled with humanitarian mission\u00a0 and not with ideas of coming to power and making hundreds of millions\u00a0 at the expense of poor and middle-class people.",
    "Earnest Hemingway wrote in his famous book titled, \u201cFor\u00a0 whom the bells toll\u201d\u2014\u201cI belong to humanity and every person\u2019s death\u00a0 diminishes me\u201d."
