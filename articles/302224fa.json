    "Facilitated by the skillful and renowned Indian Chef Bhairav Singh, the event transported guests on a sensorial journey through India\u2019s rich culinary heritage. The four-course dinner was an infusion of regional flavours from Bihar, Lucknow, Goa, Kerala, and more; each dish paired with Chef Bhairav\u2019s live storytelling and personal insights deepened the experience. From a delicately plated Gujarati Amuse Bouche to the bold richness of Kashmiri Kukur Rogan Josh, the menu was both nostalgic and inventive.",
