### Rise of digital campaigning: How social platforms shaped Sri Lanka’s elections

*2024-11-29 01:06:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Rise-of-digital-campaigning-How-social-platforms-shaped-Sri-Lanka-s-elections/14-769865) · `en`

Of all social platforms, TikTok played a significant role in ensuring election integrity

The recent Presidential and General elections in Sri Lanka marked a significant political shift, with Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People’s Power (NPP) coalition emerging as a transformative figure. Dissanayake’s victory in the September 2024 Presidential election represented a break from decades of entrenched elite politics, resonating with voters disillusioned by corruption and economic mismanagement. NPP’s subsequent landslide win in the snap Parliamentary elections solidified his mandate to pursue reforms to alleviate poverty and address systemic governance issues.

### Systems change expected  by the people from NPP Government

*2024-11-29 01:03:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Systems-change-expected-by-the-people-from-NPP-Government/4-769864) · `en`

The Government has already formed a relevant ministry and well-qualified advisers in the field. This is a good positive starting point. The people have yet to see the change in this regard. The NPP Government should also encourage the industries that encourage the creation of jobs, especially for young people, by supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and offering vocational training programs. The curriculum of the technical colleges should be overhauled, and relevant job-orientated vocational training should be further developed

The NPP, which has become a major political force in the most recent Parliamentary election in Sri Lanka, has presented a vision for system change that many people find appealing.

### Will NPP Govt. probe killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera?

*2024-11-29 00:50:26* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Will-NPP-Govt-probe-killing-of-JVP-leader-Rohana-Wijeweera/4-769853) · `en`

Given the enormity of the violence caused by the JVP and the boiling anger among the police and security personnel towards the JVP leader, it was widely believed that Rohana Wijeweera was killed in what was euphemistically termed as an “officially sanctioned unofficial execution”

Rohana Wijeweera was killed 35 years ago on 13 November 1989. The revolutionary leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna was 46 years old at the time of his death. The mastermind behind two bloody insurrections – in 1971 and from 1987 to 89 – was taken into custody on 12 November in the Kandy District and brought to Colombo. With Wijeweera’s capture and death the second JVP insurgency gradually petered out and ended

### Public support for Govt: Key for successful IMF programs

*2024-11-29 00:46:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Public-support-for-Govt-Key-for-successful-IMF-programs/4-769852) · `en`

Both the IMF and the Government officials should keep in mind that maintaining broad public support is as important as implementing necessary reforms

The new Government and the IMF have so far been in sync. For instance, the IMF underscored the importance of securing funding for social spending and supporting the most vulnerable. President Dissanayake has assured that his Government would prioritise effective use of social funds, focusing on combating child poverty, addressing malnutrition, and improving support for differently-abled individuals. These priorities, core to the NPP’s election platform, demonstrate at least some levels of alignment between the Government’s goals and IMF conditions. The mutual emphasis on social spending would also help the Government maintain its strong popularity

On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, marking the start of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, UNFPA Asia-Pacific Regional Director Pio Smith calls for urgent action to close the digital gender divide, hold tech platforms accountable, and invest in inclusive policies to combat online gender-based violence, creating safer digital spaces for all women and girls.

The internet has revolutionised our lives, offering unprecedented opportunities for connection, learning and empowerment. Yet, the digital revolution has a sinister side: the growing threat of technology-facilitated gender-based violence. A recent global study found that nearly 60% of women had experienced one or more forms of online harm. For millions of women and girls, digital spaces are fraught with risks that echo and amplify the violence they already face offline.

Government policy aims to balance economic recovery with regulatory compliance

In a bid to manage the foreign currency outflow while gradually easing restrictions on vehicle imports, the Sri Lankan Government has introduced a new regulation imposing a 3% penalty on the Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) value of any newly imported vehicle that is not registered within 90 days. This policy aims to prevent vehicle dealers from hoarding imported vehicles, potentially triggering a spike in foreign exchange usage at a time when Sri Lanka's economic stability remains fragile.
