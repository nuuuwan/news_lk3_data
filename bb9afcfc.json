    "Yesterday, the third Sunday in the month of June, we in Sri Lanka, like hundreds of thousands of others around the world celebrated \u2018Fathers\u2019 Day\u2019. Some Catholic countries of Europe commemorate Father\u2019s Day on March 19 (Saint Joseph\u2019s Day). Since the middle-aged Sikhs celebrate Father\u2019s Day on December 29 - the birthday of Guru Gobind Singh.",
    "Whatever the particular date, it is the day we, the people of this world, celebrate the important role that fathers play in our lives. In earlier times fathers were the sole bread winners of the family and a father played a vital role in the development of children and were held up as examples.",
    "They provide love, support and guidance, which are expected to help children grow into healthy and well-adjusted adults. By example they are expected to teach the children about important values, such as hard work, responsibility and respect.",
    "So, Fathers\u2019 Day provides an opportunity for society to recognize and celebrate the diversity of father figures, including stepfathers, grandfathers, uncles, and other individuals who play a fatherly role in shaping the lives of children and society\u00a0as a whole.",
    "Father\u2019s Day was originally created by Sonora Smart Dodd, a Washington-based woman in the US. Dodd was inspired to set up a special day for Fathers after attending a Mothers\u2019 Day Church service in 1909. Sonora was inspired by her father - a US civil war veteran - William Smart - who raised her and her five siblings as a single parent.",
    "Unfortunately, as is becoming common today in all major festivals - religious or otherwise - the significance of Father\u2019s Day too is fast losing out to commercialization. Hardly any of our contemporaries and especially the younger generation of today even know of the lofty ideals which led to the commemorating of this special day to Fathers the world over.",
    "In our own country, the value of \u2018Fathers\u2019 Day\u2019 is being linked to special commercial brands of gifts and hotels offering prizes to those taking part in Fathers\u2019 Day competitions!",
    "Had we actually been a bit more observant, we may have noticed that around nine million or an estimated 40% of the population in our country consumes alcohol and 99% of them are males. Those consuming alcohol daily amount to more than four million people.",
    "This market includes varieties of alcohol ranging from hard liquor - mainly arrack, beer and illicit liquor or hooch known commonly as kasippu.",
    "Illicit alcohol accounts for most of the alcohol consumed in the country. Studies done in 2013 reveal that illicit alcohol, hooch or kasippu accounts for as much as 65% of the total volume of alcohol consumed in our country. Making matters worse, statistics reveal habitual drinkers among the Estate community spend a staggering 40% of their income on alcohol.",
    "Unsurprisingly figures put out by \u2018Sri Lanka Sumithrayo\u2019 (a government-assisted charity), reveal that in the up-country plantation community, one in every 10 school-going children drop out from school due to alcohol consumption in their respective homes.",
    "What is clear is, children have to drop out of school to help provide basic food for themselves and their siblings, as fathers are failing their children. They are NOT providing even the most basic food their children need, the domestic violence they unleash is the worst example to a young child.",
    "The National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) reports a small village with around 300 families spends an average of Rs. 400,000/- per month on alcohol and tobacco. This means the excessive spending on alcohol is not limited to our tea plantation areas alone.",
    "The National Library of Medicine (NLM) in its 2019 report showed alcohol intake in the country is increasing. In other words, alcoholism is fast becoming a country-wide phenomenon and as the stats show fathers and mothers to an extent are fast failing their children.",
    "The inane media advertising \u2018Thank you dad for being the best father and protecting me\u2019 only helps take away from the growing problem of the day. No amount of anti-liquor legislation is going to make the problem go away. It only helps the growth of the illicit liquor market which causes greater health problems.",
    "It is no use referring to our 2500-year-old civilization or boasting the presence of the four largest religions in our tiny isle. When the sad fact of the matter is large sections our countrymen and women are seeking solace from alcohol."
