  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) announced that there is a growing trend of members of parliament exploiting parliamentary privileges by making statements in parliament, for matters which are sub judice (being considered by a court).",
    "In a statement, the BASL stated that it finds the recent statement by Parliamentarian Sarath Weerasekera in Parliament, on 07 July 2023 as an unfounded, brazen attack on the judiciary and the social fabric of the country.",
    "The BASL observed that the recent trend of pressure being exerted over the judiciary would potentially threaten and undermine these important principles.",
    "The BASL is of the view that the judiciary should be allowed to operate independently, free from external pressures, threats or any interferences, for a vibrant democracy to exist.",
    "The BASL further observed that it is the duty of the government and the Opposition to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary, and any interference in the judicial process sets a dangerous precedent, which must be strongly condemned. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
