  "original_body_lines": [
    "As the youngest candidate contesting for the Colombo district on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket, Dimitra Abeysekara brings a fresh perspective to Sri Lanka\u2019s political arena. Representing the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) within a coalition, Abeysekara is committed to safeguarding democracy and promoting a political environment where diverse voices are heard. In a candid conversation, he shares his thoughts on the dangers of single-party rule, the role of youth in reshaping the political landscape, and the need for continuity in policy-making. Following are excerpts:",
    "Q: Dimitra, can you tell us about your background and your role in the upcoming election?",
    "I am the youngest candidate contesting for the Colombo district on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket and the only one contesting from an alliance party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. My focus is on strengthening democracy and ensuring that we learn from the past, especially the risks associated with single-party governance as learnt from Sri Lanka\u2019s own political history.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0What concerns do you have about single-party rule in Sri Lanka?",
    "Single-party governance can lead to unchecked power, as we saw in 1977 when President J.R. Jayewardene\u2019s Government dismantled many socialist policies, such as universal healthcare and pharmaceutical manufacturing. It\u2019s vital that we maintain a diverse political landscape to avoid repeating those mistakes and ensure the fabric of the nation is not adversely altered to the detriment of society at large.",
    "We are witnessing internal divisions even within a single-party government, which shows the need for strong opposition or coalition politics. A healthy democracy requires different voices, not just for governance but for holding the Government accountable, as seen when certain agreements like SOFA and ACSA were debated; at that juncture it was not the Opposition that raised its voice but members of Government from coalition parties.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0How do you feel about the role of young politicians in the future?",
    "We\u2019re seeing a significant shift, with many young people entering politics. This new generation is less divided and more focused on doing what\u2019s best for the country, regardless of party lines. There\u2019s a growing sense of unity among us, and I believe this will help address the issues that have held Sri Lanka back.",
    "One of the problems we face is the lack of continuity in policy-making. Often, new leaders undo the work of their predecessors, even if those policies are beneficial. I believe it\u2019s important to honour the contributions of past politicians and ensure that good ideas are carried forward, regardless of who initiated them.",
    "Emphasising the importance of policy continuity and collective action, Abeysekara believes the next generation of leaders can be the key to building a stronger, more unified Sri Lanka, transcending partisan divides for the greater good."
