    "Pole Vault women Sri Lanka record holder Sachini Kushalya Perera has left the country and is working as a domestic worker in the Middle East not because of any shortcoming or mistake from the athletics administration, said Sri Lanka Athletic (SLA) General Secretary Saman Kumara Gunawardena in an inquiry by 'Daily Mirror'.",
    "National athlete Sachini Perera was attached to the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Corps and she was also a gymnast who represented the Sri Lanka at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.",
    "She has left gymnastics since 2018 and joined athletics, and has managed to renew the Pole Vault women's Sri Lanka record on several occasions.",
    "Sachini Perera last renewed the Sri Lanka record in that event in 2022 clearing 3.71 metres.",
    "She had commented in front of the Dubai media that her only objective was to participate in an international athletics tournament and win a Gold medal for Sri Lanka, but she did not get an opportunity to participate in any international tournament.",
    "She had further said that she had to reluctantly give up sports to take care of her ailing mother and family and come to work as a domestic worker in the Middle East.",
    "In relation to the accusation made by Sachini Perera in front of the international community, he said:",
    "\"As athletics administrators, there is nothing we can do for her. The main reason is that there is no international competition for Sri Lanka in the event she represents (Pole Vault Women).",
    "\"That event did not even belong to the 2019 South Asian Games. Also, the Asian Games or Asian Athletic championships Pole Vault Women standard is at a high level.",
    "\"For example, in the 2023 Asian Athletic Championship recently concluded in Thailand, the Pole Vault women event has finished as Gold Medalist (4.66m), Silver Medalist (4.51m) and Bronze Medalist (4.10m).",
    "Also, the quota that Sri Lanka gets for the Asian Games or Asian Championship is very low.",
    "Therefore, the Athletic Selection Committee selects athletes by targeting events where they can win medals. According to our athletics history, international competition participation for Shot Put, Discus Throw, Hammer Throw, Pole Vault Event has been very less.",
    "Sachini Perera has been breaking the Sri Lankan record for several years but her best performance is 3.71m.",
    "We appreciate Sachini's talent locally, but the talent to win a medal internationally is still not enough,\" said Saman Kumara Gunawardena to Daily Mirror today. (Susil Premalal)"
