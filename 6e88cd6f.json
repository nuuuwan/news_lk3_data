    "Wanindu Hasaranga claimed the most scalps at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier as Sri Lanka\u2019s spin sensation matched his feats at the past two T20 World Cups.",
    "Spin was king for Sri Lanka as they surged through the ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023 undefeated to finish as tournament winners and most importantly book their spot at the showpiece event in India later this year.",
    "Much of their success was built on the threat of spin twins Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana who were the clear top two wicket-takers at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier.",
    "Hasaranga set up Sri Lanka for a strong start with 16 wickets in their opening three matches, while Theekshana stormed home from there with 18 in their last five contests including 4/31 in the final.",
    "We take a look at the two standout spinners and the other leading wicket-takers at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023:",
    "The spin sensation claimed the most scalps at the tournament - just as he did at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in both 2021 and 2022 - following a stunning streak to open the campaign.",
    "Hasaranga matched Waqar Younis\u2019 record for five-wicket hauls in three consecutive ODIs, and worried opponents from there to finish with 22 wickets at an average of just 12.9.",
    "The 25-year-old was typically threatening with his googly but did leak runs at times as batters often tried to hit Hasaranga out of the attack.",
    "The off-spinner made his mark as opposition batters looked to counter Hasaranga and almost chased down his fellow tweaker for most wickets at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier.",
    "Theekshana particularly impressed as the stakes rose through the Super Six stage with three wickets against both Scotland and Netherlands, followed by a streak of four-wicket hauls against Zimbabwe, West Indies and the Dutch in the final.",
    "The 22-year-old\u2019s 21 wickets came at an average of 12.23 while Theekshana also restricted the runs with an economy rate of 4.02 the best among the leading bowlers.",
    "The all-rounder starred in the do-or-die clash with Scotland where Netherlands secured their spot at the Cricket World Cup, becoming just the fifth player to take a five-wicket haul and score a century in the same ODI.",
    "Both milestones were a first for de Leede but the emerging 23-year-old also showed more are likely to come as he made his mark against leading teams with three wickets against Sri Lanka though he skipped their return clash in the final to return to the UK.",
    "The leg-spinner made the most of his opportunity on the big stage with a breakthrough five-wicket haul against Oman then followed it up in the next outing with four Sri Lanka scalps.",
    "Greaves\u2019 wickets came at an average of just 16.07 and he now looms as a likely regular for Scotland in upcoming campaigns.",
    "While the hosts\u2019 had little trouble piling on the runs throughout much of the tournament, their bowling attack at times failed to match those efforts.",
    "Left-armer Ngarava carried much of the load with the ball for Zimbabwe as he regularly broke through at crucial times and claimed 14 wickets at 19.28, while also restricting the opposition to 4.73 runs an over.",
    "The left-armer again led the attack for Oman and crucially lifted as the standard of the opposition rose.",
    "The veteran pacer picked up 5/55 against Scotland and took three scalps from the Netherlands as the qualification contenders otherwise set imposing targets for Oman.",
    "- Meanwhile, Sean Williams went on an incredible scoring streak for Zimbabwe while amassing the most runs at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier, as Sri Lanka\u2019s openers proved to be crucial to their success.",
    "A red-hot Sean Williams was the leading run-scorer at the ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023 after a stunning five-innings stretch that included three centuries and 532 runs.",
    "Williams\u2019 pile of runs took the tournament hosts to the brink of an all-important top two finish before they dropped their last two matches to cruelly miss a place at the ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup on net run-rate.",
    "A dominant Sri Lanka claimed one of those two spots with much of their success built on the platforms set by their opening pair Pathum Nissanka and Dimuth Karunaratne.",
    "We take a closer look at the the Zimbabwe standout and Sri Lanka\u2019s top two, as well as the other leading run-scorers at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023:",
    "The left-hander put together one of the all-time great scoring streaks to compile the third-most runs ever in a five-match stretch of ODIs. Williams amassed 532 runs in Zimbabwe's opening five matches at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier with three centuries and a 91, and finished with another fifty in his 600 runs for an average of 100 at the tournament.",
    "The 36-year-old scored at a rapid rate too, plundering 13 sixes and 67 boundaries across his seven innings for a devastating strike rate of 139.21.",
    "The rising star of the Sri Lanka batting line-up impressed with back-to-back centuries late in the tournament but was just as crucial early as the competition pacesetters made a statement. Nissanka made at least a start in all but one innings to add two fifties to his tons, while only being dismissed six times for an average of 69.5.",
    "The left-handed veteran was the perfect foil for his younger opening partner as he perhaps finally proved he can make an impact in the white-ball format. The 35-year-old notched his maiden ODI century against Ireland and put together three fifties across the tournament to finish with an average of 61.5.",
    "The young gun smashed two centuries at the tournament including 106 in the do-or-die clash with Netherlands when Scotland ultimately had a Cricket World Cup spot fall from their grasp. McMullen was also among the top-10 wicket-takers at the Cricket World Cup and looms as an exciting prospect to lead Scotland onto grander stages for many years to come.",
    "The linchpin of the West Indies\u2019 white-ball batting line-up stepped up with important runs and the most sixes at the tournament (16) even as the former powerhouse\u2019s campaign crumbled. Pooran notched just his second century in the format against Nepal then later added an undefeated 104 against Netherlands even as West Indies qualification hopes started to fade. (ICC)"
