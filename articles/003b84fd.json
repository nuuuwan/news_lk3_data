On the investment front, he said the Council is in talks to attract France-based investors operating in India to explore opportunities for expansion into Sri Lanka.",
    "These initiatives were part of the groundwork laid over the past year, with the aim of achieving positive outcomes in the medium to long term.",
    "Lambert\u2019s address focused on his diplomatic vision, with the three key pillars of economic collaboration, maritime, logistics and aviation and tourism guiding France\u2013Sri Lanka cooperation.",
    "\u201cOur commercial exchanges are diverse and have now surpassed the half billion euro mark, reaching \u20ac540 million by the end of 2024.

Additionally, its proximity to France\u2019s overseas territory of R\u00e9union Island made Sri Lanka a natural partner in France\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy.",

In 2024, France ranked as the fifth-largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka, with 88,000 French visitors drawn by the country\u2019s biodiversity, heritage, cuisine, and hospitality. This number was only increasing and would rise to 100,000 within this year or the next, he said.",
