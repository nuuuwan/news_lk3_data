    "The UNCTAD revised its well-established LSCI in mid-March this year, adjusting the impact of vessel size on the final index measurements. In the initial index, the country or port that received the highest score in the reference year of 2006 was assigned a value of 100, which serves as a benchmark to assign value to the other ports and countries. Accordingly, the LSCI was updated this year."
