    "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe said neither Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) nor the rights holder for the Lanka Premier League (LPL) had sought his permission before conducting this year's edition of the LPL.",
    "The minister said that according to the Sports Law it was necessary to receive his consent before any tournament.",
    "\"I don't know how this tournament was played under previous Sports Ministers, but they have not sought my permission,\" the minister said.",
    "\"I wrote twice to SLC asking them to seek approval for the tournament in accordance with the provisions of the sports law, but they did not,\" Ranasinghe added.",
    "\"This is why I didn't go for the opening ceremony of the tournament even though I was invited. It is yet another black mark on SLC,\" Minister Ranasinghe said."
