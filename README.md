### Imposing costs on business; disregarding ability to enforce

*2024-04-25 05:42:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imposing-costs-on-business-disregarding-ability-to-enforce/4-761009) · `en`

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis

The Gender Equality Bill has been gazetted. It requires every public institution and private institution to appoint a senior official to be responsible for gender mainstreaming and gender equality (“Gender Focal Point”). That person is legally required to prepare a plan of activities targeting their areas of responsibility and report directly to the Council on a quarterly basis with a copy to Women Parliamentarians Caucus in Parliament (section 17).

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis. It will also impose costs on State entities and large corporations, but the focus here is on small business which are least capable of meeting unfunded mandates.

### Dissecting digital disruption: The imperative of digital literacy for today’s CEOs

*2024-04-25 05:35:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Dissecting-digital-disruption-The-imperative-of-digital-literacy-for-today-s-CEOs/4-761008) · `en`

A golden rule for leaders embarking on digital transformation is to educate themselves. This education is not merely academic; it is a necessary step in becoming conversant in the language of technology, a prerequisite for the formulation and execution of effective digital strategies – adapted from Rewired, McKinsey, 2021.

We have never seen change like we experience today. In today›s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, corporate leaders find themselves rowing not in the calm waters but in the turbulent rapids of white-water rafting. The calm predictability of the past has given way to a landscape where constant change is the only constant.

Amidst this turbulence, one of the most significant drivers of change has been technology, whose capabilities are expanding at a staggering rate. There are three factors that create these ‘disruptive’ trends, which need to be understood in the right magnitude and scale.

Stories have been a primary means of transmitting knowledge and cultural values across generations. Community reading in the Temple in Sri Lanka circa 1923 from a hand etching by Charles W. Bartlett

The thirst for stories is evidenced in how people attended book fairs through the pandemic and economic restrictions. So much so, that we wonder whether our collective appetite for stories is only heightened in crises. Photo by B.Ganguly.

### Hambantota Port’s container services will make Sri Lanka a key logistics hub in Indian Ocean

*2024-04-25 05:25:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Hambantota-Port-s-container-services-will-make-Sri-Lanka-a-key-logistics-hub-in-Indian-Ocean/4-761006) · `en`

Sri Lanka is an island nation situated in a strategically important location in the Indian Ocean Region at the centre of maritime trade routes in between East and West, as well as in the middle of Africa, the Arab, and Eastern worlds and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

Sri Lanka’s location enables the country to provide quick and efficient global and regional connectivity to move cargo to and from Asia to the rest of the world. More than 60,000 ships ply this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the world’s oil and half of the global containerised traffic.

Sri Lanka, also located very close to all major ports in the Indian subcontinent, especially those of India, with the rising middle class, makes it a prime location that is able to provide fast and easy connectivity to the Indian subcontinent through its feeder network.

### We need a revisionist president, not merely a reformist one

*2024-04-25 05:21:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/We-need-a-revisionist-president-not-merely-a-reformist-one/4-761005) · `en`

SJB presidential campaign manager Sujeewa Senasinghe and live-wire SM Marikkar accuse President Wickremesinghe of refusing the SJB its request of venue for May 1st and switching that preferred location to the JVP-NPP instead.

Meanwhile, six SJB MPs including shadow Finance Minister Dr Harsha de Silva accept decentralized funds from President Wickremesinghe allegedly without obtaining party permission. (https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SJB-embroiled-in-controversy-after-its-MPs-secure-funds-from-Govt-without-party-approval/108-281121)

Is Ranil already a shareholder of the SJB, while simultaneously undermining it? Is he patronizing policy proxies in the SJB?

Little wonder then, as Prof Charitha Herath noted, that the SJB challenges the JVP-NPP to a debate on economics, but doesn’t challenge the incumbent and his administration with its austerity policies, to any such debate.

### Austerity, dispossession and injustice: Facets of the debt crisis in Sri Lanka

*2024-04-25 05:19:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Austerity-dispossession-and-injustice-Facets-of-the-debt-crisis-in-Sri-Lanka/4-761004) · `en`

The widespread and ongoing debt crisis today is a wakeup call

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its postcolonial history in April 2022. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led process of recovery that followed has not only been disastrous in terms of the economic policy package proposed by the Government. The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed. Sri Lanka provides lessons about both the broken global financial system and the widespread consequences of an unjust debt resolution architecture affecting other countries in the Global South.

Speaking at a press conference, Silva expressed the NPP’s confidence that Premadasa would not partake in a public debate. “That is why they continue to engage in a back-and-forth with us on this matter and make various assertions,” he said.

While the SJB has sought a meeting with the NPP this week to iron out the debate details, Silva criticised the SJB’s reluctance to participate in a debate on the dates proposed by the NPP or provide alternative dates.

### Interim injunction issued against Wijeyadasa’s SLFP Acting Chairmanship

The Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction against Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from performing duties as the Acting Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday.

A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

The injunctions, in effect until 8 May, were granted considering a case filed by SLFP office bearers Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, and Mahinda Amaraweera.

Chandaka Jayasundara PC representing the plaintiffs told the courts that it is illegal and against the party’s constitution for the defendants to hold the positions.

Jayasundara noted that Rajapakshe’s membership status disqualifies him from holding any position within the SLFP, citing constitutional illegality in having a member of another party in such a role.

Additionally, Jayasundara highlighted that the Executive Committee convened on 21 April to appoint Rajapakshe was unlawful.

The whole discourse of the Easter Sunday attack is degenerating into a sordid freakshow

Islamization and the Arabization of some quarters of the Muslim community, leading up to the Easter Sunday attack, created permissive conditions for the Easter Sunday attacks

### Road closures spark public outcry during Iranian President’s visit

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror)- The closure of roads in Colombo without prior notice during evening rush hours as part of security arrangements for the visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inconvenienced the public and motorists alike.

Incensed by the notice of road closures, they vented their anger by honking horns. The government made tight security arrangements in view of the visit of the Iranian leader for the inauguration of the Uma Oya project.

The roads were closed to facilitate the movement of his convoy without any prior notice as a security measure, but the motorists’ protest amounts to kind of an embarrassment for the government during the visit of a friendly country that has stood by Sri Lanka during its trying times. Iran and Sri Lanka have enjoyed excellent ties for decades and cooperated with each other in numerous international forums.

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror) - Chamari Athapaththu's historical 195 against South Africa last week saw her claiming the top spot of ICC Women's ODI Batting Rankings on Tuesday.

Hailing from a modest family in Kurunegala, Chamari's greatest supporter in cricket was her late father who used to accompany her for practices in Colombo, but sadly passed away in 2008 - a year before her international debut. However, her cricketing journey never stopped there, and after 15 years at the top level of women's cricket, Chamari has now reached the twilight of her career.

Following the cracking 195 against South African women's team, Chamari told the media that her 'retirement is very soon.'

Currently responsible religious leaders say that the group, including Sahran, is a maneuver for Gotabhaya Rajapakse to take over to this.

Gotabhaya Rajapakse's political mistakes are a different story. But if this is an attempt to call Gotabhaya Rajapakse a maneuver, it should be seen as a conspiracy to cover up these issues.. It is not acceptable that he was aware of this.

Meanwhile, 95 percent of the MPs would not have read the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sunday Attack.. You have to see who witnessed the Commission.

In a glass cage in a Moscow court stands Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov on Wednesday (April 24), a day after he was arrested at work for accepting large bribes.

The court remanded him in custody for two months and said Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties to receive property and services while working for the ministry of defense.

Ivanov, deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages.

The defense ministry, whose spending has spiraled since the start of the war, has made no comment.

As the right hand man of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Ivanov’s detention is the highest profile corruption case since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been informed, and Shoigu had also been told.

Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu.

### The whole discourse of the Easter Sunday attack is degenerating into a sordid freakshow where the state, and not the Islamists who blew up the innocents, stand accused.

*2024-04-24 18:00:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83936) · `en`

Five years ago, on Easter Sunday, a group of local Islamists carried out coordinated suicide attacks targeting three churches and tourist hotels, killing over 270 worshipers and tourists and wounding 500 others.

The fifth anniversary of that heinous crime, which fell last Sunday (April 21), turned out to be a sordid display of politicking by the political parties, the catholic clergy and other usual culprits, who claim to campaign for justice for the victims.

The National People’s Power of the JVP issued a seven-point agenda that it said would be implemented if it comes to power to hold accountable those responsible for the tragedy and serve justice to the victims.

Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of Samagi Jana Balawegaya, also made a similar pledge in Parliament, promising to launch a fresh commission of inquiry, with the participation of local and international experts within two months of his election.

The broader All Share Index closed up 0.66 percent, or 77.50 points, at 11,905; while the S&P SL20 Index closed up 0.38 percent, or 13.17 points, at 3,495.

“Buying interest was coming into the small caps from the retail front,” market participants said.

The ASPI was up mostly due to interest in LOLC group companies; Browns Investments Plc (up at 6.20), LOLC Finance Plc (up at 7.40), LOLC General Insurance Plc (up at 7.00). LOLC Holdings Plc was also up at 445.25.

“There was a run on penny stocks, possibly because banking stocks had slowed down,” market participants said.

“There was also interest in index heavyweight Hayleys.” Hayleys Plc is one of six companies that had expressed interest in the acquisition of SriLankan Airlines Limited, the state owned enterprise restructuring unit said. Shares of the bluechip conglomerate closed up at 84.90.
