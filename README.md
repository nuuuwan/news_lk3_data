Indian media reports that four fishermen from Andhra Pradesh will return home on September 30 after being kept in the Jaffna jail for 52 days.

The boat carrying the fishermen departed from the Sri Lankan coast to Kakinada on September 27.

They were deported following the efforts of state officials in Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in New Delhi.

On September 26, the Sri Lanka Coast Guard handed over the fishermen to the Indian Coast Guard at the Mandapam camp.

The fishermen had gone to Nagapattinam to buy a secondary trawling fishing boat.

But when returning home, reports reported that Sri Lanka was floating in water due to technical disorder.

After taking the issue to the Foreign Ministry, the Indian High Commission in Colombo began their efforts to return.

The High Commission has reported that four fishermen have been safely sent back to the Sri Lankan government and the support of the Indian and Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard.

When Vijay started talking there, his Mike didn't work. The people behind him came to the campaign bus to listen to his speech. Thus, those who waited in front of them were crowded.

Singapore has called on the United Nations to rein in the rising use of veto powers by the five permanent members of the Security Council and pressed for reforms to make the organisation more inclusive.

Delivering the country’s national statement at the UN General Assembly in New York on Sunday (Sep 28), Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said the veto is being deployed with growing frequency at a time of widening conflicts.

“The increasing, and if I may add, cynical use of vetoes by the P5 must be constrained,” said Dr Balakrishnan, adding that the wider UN membership must reach an agreement on how this veto is exercised in the future.

“Just as the world has changed dramatically in the last 80 years, it is also clear that the UN needs to reform to be fit for purpose for the next stretch,” he said. “We need a more representative and a more inclusive UN that reflects current realities.”
