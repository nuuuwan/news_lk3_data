    "This petition had been filed naming the Director General of Wildlife Conservation Department, the IGP and the Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Temple as respondents. The petitioner further sought a writ of Prohibition preventing the Director General of Wildlife Conservation Department from issuing licenses enabling the Chief Incumbent of Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya to possess elephants.",
    "The petitioner said that the second respondent IGP has failed to perform his duties over a complaint urging to take necessary legal action under Sections 2 and 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance. The petitioner stated on or around January, 2020, the government of Myanmar had appealed to Sri Lanka to stop the abuse of this elephant.",
    "The Myanmar Embassy in Colombo also asked the Sri Lanka authorities to punish those who persecuted the elephant as seen in videos uploaded in the social media, the petitioner further added.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
