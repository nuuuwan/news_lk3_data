    "In celebration of World Children\u2019s Day 2025, Sri Lanka Insurance Life (SLIC Life) has extended a Rs. 1 million free life insurance cover to the parents of every child born on 1 October, across the island. Now in its fourth consecutive year, the initiative reflects SLIC Life\u2019s mission to provide financial protection to families at crucial moments while reinforcing the value of life insurance as a safety net.",
    "This free life cover provides parents of newborns with vital financial security during uncertain times, helping families lay a stable foundation for the future. On 1 October, SLIC Life implemented the program nationwide, covering every hospital in Sri Lanka to ensure parents across the country benefitted from this unique offering.",
    "Launched in 2022 as part of SLIC Life\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, the project was designed to protect the future of the nation\u2019s children by supporting their parents. The positive response and impact on families over the past three years inspired SLIC Life to continue the initiative, which has since grown into one of the company\u2019s most meaningful annual CSR efforts. As the national Life Insurer, SLIC Life is dedicated to uplifting the communities it serves. Its CSR agenda spans child education, community development, and cultural preservation, contributing to the long-term sustainability of Sri Lanka and strengthening the well-being of its people.",
    "To celebrate the initiative, a special event was held at Castle Street Hospital for Women, Colombo, on 1 October, where representatives of SLIC Life joined hospital staff and families in marking this milestone. The gathering emphasised the importance of life insurance in securing brighter futures for children and their families.",
    "SLIC Life\u2019s commitment to children and education is deeply embedded in its CSR strategy. Recently, the company was honoured with the Excellence in CSR Award at the Sri Lanka Leadership Awards, acknowledging its sustained contributions to education and community welfare. A flagship initiative, \u2018Pasal Piriyatha Surakimu\u2019 launched in 2007, has benefitted over 3,365 underprivileged schools with classroom refurbishments, water facilities, libraries, and learning resources. In May 2025 alone, SLIC Life revitalised 100 schools simultaneously, showcasing its large-scale commitment to education. Complementing this effort, the \u2018Suba Pathum Scholarship Program\u2019 has since 2014, awarded over 2,200 scholarships worth more than Rs. 240 million to children of policyholders excelling in national examinations, including 225 scholarships in 2025.",
    "Beyond CSR, SLIC Life continues to introduce insurance solutions designed to safeguard children\u2019s futures. The \u2018Minimuthu\u2019 range offers tailored plans to support education and aspirations, while the \u2018School Fee Protector\u2019 plan ensures children\u2019s studies continue uninterrupted even in times of financial difficulty.",
    "SLIC Life recognises that children are the foundation of the nation\u2019s future. By offering a Rs. 1 million free life cover to parents of newborns on World Children\u2019s Day, the company demonstrates how insurance provides essential protection throughout life\u2019s journey. Through this program and other initiatives, SLIC Life has set a benchmark for the industry, highlighting the importance of financial security for families. With children at the heart of its mission, the company remains committed to creating a brighter, more secure future for all Sri Lankans."
