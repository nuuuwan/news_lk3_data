    "Police have been investigating Rathana Thera\u2019s alleged involvement in the abduction of Our Power of People Party (OPPP) General Secretary Ven. Wedinigama Wimalatissa Thera. According to the complaint, Rathana Thera is accused of forcing Wimalatissa Thera to sign documents that allowed him to secure a National List seat in Parliament.",
    "Law enforcement authorities reported that Rathana Thera had been evading arrest for several weeks. Officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had carried out extensive searches at his Rajagiriya temple, other temples, meditation centres, and several housing complexes, but were unable to locate him.",
    "On 18 August, the Nugegoda Magistrate\u2019s Court issued an arrest warrant against Rathana Thera after his failure to appear before investigators. He subsequently surrendered and appeared before the Magistrate\u2019s Court yesterday, after which he was ordered to be placed in remand custody."
