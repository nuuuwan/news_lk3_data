    "There is an increase in the number of wild animals dying due to electrocution by illegal power lines that have been constructed insecurely to protect farmland and property.",
    "According to records at the Wildlife Department, a large number of elephants have died due to electrocution by illegal power lines.",
    "Accordingly, a total of 36 elephants have been killed by electrocution during the past seven months.",
    "The Wildlife Department used to erect electric fences to prevent elephants from attacking villages. They used to erect these fences according to a method designed through scientific and technical specifications and to act as a mental barrier for elephants rather than to hinder their natural movements.",
    "If a private electric fence is erected to protect crops, it should be done only under the specifications of the Wildlife Department.",
    "If not, the Department will impose severe penalties under the Wildlife and Flora Protection Ordinance against those who set illegal power lines.\u00a0(Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
