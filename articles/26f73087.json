    "Accordingly, Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage ordered to remand the suspect till February 7.",
    "The suspect Mahinda Kodithuwakku was arrested by the CID for allegedly insulting Buddhism and hurting religious feelings.",
    "Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Pieris, appearing for the Attorney General, moved court that the suspect be further remanded since he requires further medical treatment for his unstable mental condition.",
    "President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the suspect informed court that there is no ground to refuse bail in terms of Section 14 of the Bail Act and moved court that his client be released on bail on whatever conditions the court deems fit.",
    "However, the Magistrate made an order remanding the suspect till February 7 since his father is not physically capable of looking after the suspect whilst receiving treatment for mental health."
