    "Sri Lanka\u2019s transition toward a modern, knowledge-driven economy depends not only on fiscal reforms and foreign investment, but also on the strength of its higher education sector. At the forefront of this transformation stands the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), a leading non-state higher education provider.",
    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review, Dr. Upendra Pieris, senior academic at SLIIT, stressed that the institute\u2019s achievements extend beyond the classroom. \u201cWe see ourselves as partners in national development. By producing industry-ready graduates and driving cutting-edge research, SLIIT contributes directly to Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness in the global marketplace, he said.",
    "Over the past decade, SLIIT has expanded its academic portfolio to include computing, engineering, business, architecture, law, and humanities. Its internationally benchmarked programmes have enabled thousands of students to access global-standard education locally, at a fraction of the cost of overseas study.",
    "This model has significant economic implications. By retaining students in the country, SLIIT helps minimise foreign exchange outflow while also reducing brain drain. As Dr. Pieris explained: \u201cEach student who studies here instead of going abroad is not only saving valuable foreign exchange, but also staying within the local ecosystem to contribute to innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth.\u201d",
    "SLIIT\u2019s success lies in its strong ties with industry, which ensure that graduates are highly employable. Employers consistently report that SLIIT graduates demonstrate adaptability, technical know-how, and an innovative mindset.",
    "\u201cOur graduates are work-ready from day one, Pieris emphasised. \u201cThrough internships, live projects, and industry advisory boards, we ensure that the gap between academia and the world of work is minimal. This directly translates into higher employability and faster job creation.\u201d",
    "With Sri Lanka\u2019s unemployment concerns persisting, particularly among graduates of traditional universities, SLIIT\u2019s ability to place students in multinational corporations and leading local enterprises is a significant differentiator. By generating a workforce aligned with industry needs, SLIIT is effectively fuelling the country\u2019s human capital engine.",
    "Beyond teaching, SLIIT is steadily building its research profile in areas with direct commercial and societal value: artificial intelligence, data science, renewable energy, and sustainable urban development. Research collaborations and funded projects are increasingly linking SLIIT\u2019s academics with both government and private sector stakeholders.",
    "Dr. Pieris noted that research must ultimately translate into economic outcomes. \u201cOur priority is applied research\u2014innovation that can lead to new products, services, and efficiencies. In this way, universities like ours become incubators of enterprise and productivity, he said.",
