    "The Supreme Court (SC) has dismissed the much-discussed fundamental rights (FR) petition someone filed, last week, seeking to delay the upcoming presidential election. Nobody expected that deplorable attempt to reach fruition, but it created quite a stir and became grist for the Opposition\u2019s mill. Nothing can now prevent the Election Commission from going ahead with declaring the next presidential election, which has to be held in September or October 2024. The furore created by the petition and the SC decision remind us of two Shakespearean plays, \u2018Much ado about nothing\u2019 and \u2018All\u2019s well that ends well\u2019.",
    "As for the abortive petition, it is not possible that its mover acted of his own volition. The general consensus is that he had a handler with a political agenda. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is having a hard time trying to convince the public that he had no hand in the controversial petition, and he is ready to face the upcoming presidential election, but the Opposition keeps on accusing him of trying every trick in the book to delay the presidential poll. He was compelled to make a public statement that the constitutionally stipulated length of the presidential term was five years, and the next presidential election would have to take place this year itself.",
    "Never a dull day in Sri Lanka! The Opposition now claims that the ruling coalition is trying to delay the presidential election by provoking the workers of the Government Press into launching a protracted strike. It has found something new to bludgeon the government with. It says the Cabinet has sought to curtail the overtime of those workers, shift the Government Press and sell the land where it is currently situated in a bid to drive them to a trade union battle. Some Opposition politicians have made public a copy of a Cabinet paper, claiming that it is documentary proof, but whether the government is contemplating such a suicidal course of action remains to be seen; its leaders know what it is like to be pursued by the irate public.",
    "It is not possible that President Wickremesinghe, a lawyer himself, would have sought to delay the presidential poll with the help of an FR petition that had no leg to stand on, as was obvious even to a layperson with a nodding acquaintance with the Constitution. His close associates have claimed that someone had that petition filed with a view to tarnishing his image by making him out to be afraid of facing the upcoming presidential contest. That may be true, but given the government\u2019s history postponing elections, it is a case of giving a dog a bad name and hanging him.",
    "It may be recalled that President Wickremesinghe and the SLPP caused the local government elections to disappear last year, and UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara insists that the presidential election should be delayed. So, it is only natural that the public puts two and two together. Perceptions do matter as much as facts in politics.",
    "Range Bandara and others of his ilk in the UNP are behaving like the proverbial pet monkey which inflicted fatal cut injuries on his royal master in his sleep, with his own sword, in a bid to kill a mosquito sitting on him; it was a simian act of good faith, which however proved disastrous. President Wickremesinghe has chosen to surround himself with the very associates who ruined him politically during the Yahapalana government. He is seen in the exalted company of those undesirables who have crawled out of the woodwork and appear in television discussions.",
    "Meanwhile, the aforesaid FR petition has brought to light some constitutional ambiguities. There are no signs of a new Constitution being unveiled in the foreseeable future. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed an expert committee to write a Constitution, and it submitted its report to him in 2022. A Cabinet subcommittee was appointed to study it and make recommendations. But the report has since been shelved. Therefore, it is imperative that flaws in the existing Constitution be rectified urgently, for such deficiencies have the potential to undermine the integrity of the supreme law.",
