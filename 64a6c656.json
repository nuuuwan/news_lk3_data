    "The Ceylon Tea Board had stressed that to get a proper yield from tea cultivation, fertilizer should be applied properly. However, due to some tea growers not applying fertilizer, tea plantations do not get a proper yield, tea industry sources said.",

    "The minister also said that it was reported that some tea growers use the money provided for the buying of fertilizer for other purposes.Meanwhile, informed sources said that the annual fertilizer requirement for tea cultivation in Sri Lanka is 40,000 metric tons. The amount spent on it is around Rs. 6800 million.",

The Tea Development Authority, Tea Small Holdings Development Authority, Tea Research Institute, Tea Suppliers Association and Tea Manufacturers Association featured in the talks.",
