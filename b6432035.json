    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has been moving forward in bilateral debt negotiations by talking to individual creditors despite a clearly defined process for dealing with Paris Club and other creditors, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka was following a \u2018debtor led\u2019 strategy by reforming the economy and also aiming at a \u2018highly efficient green economy\u2019, which was going to increase financing needs, President Wickremesinghe told a financing summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris.",
    "\u201cWhat else helped us was that Sri Lanka had ongoing negotiations with Japan, India and China and separately regarding further trade integration and also regarding some of the development programs for the future,\u201d President Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka was supported by the International Monetary Fund and also India who gave about 4 billion US dollars in 2022 he said when all other funding dried up.",
    "China\u2019s Sinopec eyes refinery investment in Sri Lanka amid rising geopolitical concerns",
    "Sri Lanka President cleared to discuss cancelled LRT after soured Japan relations",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s currency crisis intensified in 2022 after central bank open market operations depleted forex reserves and float (full suspension of convertibility) of the currency failed due to a surrender rule, leading to the collapse of the rupee from 200 to 360 to the US dollar.",
    "India had supported Sri Lanka with about 4 billion US dollars in the worst time, Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka went through a period of \u2018reserve graduation\u2019 with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank making the country eligible for concessionary funding.",
    "After a staff level agreement was signed with the IMF there was no clearly defined path to follow in bilateral debt restructuring with some lenders outside the Paris Club, he said.",
    "The IMF program was Sri Lanka\u2019s program where out of a menu of options 90 percent was agreed, Wickremesinghe said.",
    "The lack of a clearly defined path was a problem but a \u2018common framework\u2019 for middle income countries may also not help, because such efforts tended to move at the pace of the slowest creditor, he said.",
    "Under an \u2018ad hoc\u2019 arrangement, India and several countries had come to work with the Paris Club and China was an observer.",
    "\u201cWe are able to work with the most committed creditors, raising the general quality and efficiency of the process,\u201d Wickremsinghe said.",
    "Wickremesinghe said a new debt negotiation framework was needed since geopolitical tensions played a part, which cannot be solved by the debtor countries.",
    "\u201cThe mistrust between US and China and the growing tensions has to be address by you all, not merely Sri Lanka and the country concerned,\u201d Wickremsinghe said.",
    "\u201cIf you do not resolve it, Asia and Africa we will get caught into another situation not of our making.",
    "\u201cRestructuring is needed. But it has to move fast, otherwise LIC or MIC, the countries will not have much hope.\u201d",
    "A number of countries with highly unstable, depreciating, soft-pegged (flexible exchange rates) who had engaged in inflationary open market operations and covid monetary re-financed funding, are now in the brink of default.",
    "Many of the countries had loaded up of sovereign debt as bond buyers went on a yield seeking spree as reserve currency quantitative easing (money printing) kept interest rates artificially low and China also busted some of its reserves on the Belt and Road project."
