  "original_title": "The Brutal  Attack on  EPDP Leader Douglas Devananda  by LTTE Suspects at the Kalutara Jail.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Kathiravelu Nythiananda Douglas Devananda is  a senior Sri Lankan Tamil political leader. The Secretary-General of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party(EPDP) has been  continuously representing the Jaffna district in Parliament since 1994. Devananda known generally as Douglas , has served as  a cabinet minister in different Governments for more than 15 years.  He is currently the minister of Fisheries in the Government headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "Douglas Devananda  is one of the few Tamil political leaders who has been courageous enough to  oppose  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) in politico-military terms in the past. Though many  Tamil politicos  who fell foul of the  LTTE were killed by the tigers,  Douglas Devananda is one of the few Tamil  frontline leaders who has escaped death at the hands of the tigers. There were many assassination attempts by the LTTE, but the doughty Douglas survived them all.",
    "It is against this backdrop that this column focuses on  an attempt on Devananda\u2019s life 25 years ago. This attempt on 30 June 1998 was quite peculiar in the sense that it was different to the  usual modus operandi adopted by the LTTE. In this case Devananda then a MP  was set upon by Tamil prisoners held at the Kalutara jail and brutally attacked with  crudely  fashioned improvised weapons.  He had gone there on a goodwill mission to end a  hunger strike by some Tamil detenues. The attackers were  suspected hard core LTTE members. Devananda was seriously injured but survived miraculously. One of his eyes suffered  permanent impairment.",
    "When the Kalutara attack happened President Chandrika Kumaratunga was in power. The  prisons department came under the purview of the Justice Ministry then. The minister of Justice  was Prof.G.L.Peiris. The EPDP headed by Devananda had nine MPs in Parliament then. The  EPDP supported  Kumaratnge\u2019s Peoples Alliance(PA) Govt in Parliament while being in the opposition. Though having MPs in Parliament, the EPDP was also a para-military outfit collaborating with the Sri Lankan armed forces in the war against the LTTE. As such the LTTE branded the EPDP as traitors and tried in many ways to assassinate the EPDP leader Devananda.",
    "The Jawatte  jail in Kalutara had a very large number of Tamil prisoners as opposed to Sinhalese inmates. There were two reasons for this.  The first was that a very large number of Tamil detainees held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act(PTA )had been transferred from the Welikade jail to Kalutara after Tamil prisoners engaged in a large scale hunger strike protesr. Subsequently Tamils  held as \u201cTerrorism suspects:in other parts of the country were also brought to the Jawatte jail in Kalutara.",
    "The second reason  was that a large number of Sinhala prisoners had been transferred elsewhere from Kalutara. This was because there had been a prison riot in 1997 in which three Tamil speaking prisoners were killed by Sinhala fellow prisoners. Thereafter the number of Sinhala prisoners was reduced. The induction of more Tamil prisoners coupled with the reduction  in the numbers of  Sinhala prisoners resulted in a situation where Tamil detenies  comprised the overwhelming majority in the Kalutara prison.",
    "The Kalutara jail on June 30th 1997  reportedly had 648 prisoners. 51 of these were Sinhalese. The other 597 were all Tamil political detenues. Among these were 43 persons convicted under the PTA. The other 554 were those arrested and detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or the emergency regulations. Technically they were all \u201cTerrorist\u201d suspects.Some sections of the media referred  to them all as terrorists or tigers.",
    "However  some of those convicted were undergoing punishment or were  undergoing trial for minor offences such as not informing the authorities of LTTE whereabouts or providing food or digging bunkers under duress. Nevertheless the unfortunate image reinforced constantly by sections of the media was that all these persons were LTTE.",
    "Most detenues  were  kept in prison pending trial or on the excuse that further investigations were  going on. These \u201cPending\u201d periods however were quite lengthy.As such the incarceration  of many of these inmates was in a sense tantamount to detention without trial in practice.",
    "An ongoing demand of the detenues then was  that speedier justice should be meted out to them. Many of them claimed to be   totally innocent or that even under the draconian provisions of the PTA their alleged offence was quite minimal.So they want ed the authorities to expedite their cases.\u201dIf we are guilty, punish us, If we are innocent set us free, but for heaven\u2019s sake do it quickly please\u201d was the essence of their grievance.",
    "The Tamil detenues at Kalutara had  been agitating many times that either inquiries should be undertaken or that they be set free .\u201dVisaranai sei allathu viduthalai sei\u201d was  their  slogan in Tamil. They  undertook many hunger strikes as  the only available form of effective protest in jail. The pattern was  for Tamil political parties supporting the government to convey these demands to the govt  and elicit some reassurance or guarantee. These were then conveyed back to the protesting prisoners who then abandon their protests on the strength of these assurances.",
    "So the protests that begin with a bang saying \u201cfast unto death\u201d end on a whimpering note of trusting government assurances. What actually happens is a crisis managing exercise and  not a genuine resolution of the  issue. This has  been the case in almost any political promise made to the Tamil minority in the past-  all promises are \u201cgone with the wind\u201d.",
    "The last major death fast protest  by  Tamil prisoners  in Kalutara was on Mar 21st 1998. A  temporary settlement was achieved on the basis that their grievance would be resolved within three months. As usual nothing tangible happened within that time limit. So Tamil detenues at Kalutara decided to commence a death fast again.",
    "On June 23rd 1998  four detenues started a fast unto death. Within the next 48 hours 43 others too joined the fast. On June 26th all the Tamil detenues at Kalutara went on a day long fast. Thereafter the others too went on a relay fast in batches to express solidarity with the 47 detenues on a prolonged fast. Meanwhile on an initiative of the PLOTE ,Tamil political parties other than the TULF staged a token fast in sympathy on June 26th at the Nallur Kandasamy Kovil in Jaffna. The TNA was not in existence then.",
    "When the June 1998 fast was underway,  there was a firm resolve  on the part of detenues to go through with the death fast until a definite  and positive response was elicited from the govt. As the fast progressed the condition of five fastees took a turn for the worse. After a few days of perceived apathy , the authorities began taking action. Thus on June 29th the Attorney-General\u2019s Dept intimated to the detenues that for a start 23 of those being detained will be released on bail.",
    "In the past too several detainees have been released on a bailbond and in most such cases the EPDP stood surety or paid up the cash for these detenues who were mainly from poor farming or fishing families now displaced.",
    "The legal work in these instances was done  by Maheswary Velayutham a well-known  human rights  lawyer in her capacity as secretary of the forum for human dignity. The human dignity forum was more or less the legal wing of the EPDP. Maheswary  Velayutham when interacting with the Kalutara detenues made impassioned pleas that the fast be called off in the interests of the affected fastees whose health was deteriorating.",
    "Upon being told by the detenues that merely releasing 23 prisoners on a piecemeal basis was not enough, Ms. Velayutham  promised them that a time bound guarantee could be provided and that Tamil political party leaders could be made guarantors for it. The detenues agreed to call off the fast if Tamil political parties could provide them such a concrete ironclad guarantee.",
    "Thereafter Ms. Velautham persuaded Douglas Devananda to undertake the guarantor mission and visit Kalutara. The EPDP being  keen to establish itself as a popular  political party decided to take all the \u201ckudos\u201d for resolving the crisis. Instead of getting other Tamil party leaders also as guarantors, the EPDP decided to go solo.",
    "So Devananda on June 30th  contacted the then Prisons commissioner  K.W.E. Karaliyadde and obtained approval for his \u201cbenevolent\u201d mission to Kalutara. In the afternoon at 3 pm Douglas Devananda, three armed bodyguards and Maheswary  Velayutham journeyed to Kalutara. They were joined in  Kalutara  by  Suhada Gamlath  an Attorney General\u2019s dept official and LA Leelaratna the  Prisons supdt.",
    "Prisons regulations prevented Devananda\u2019s armed bodyguards from accompanying him into jail premises. So they had to station themselves outside.  Devananda who usually carried two guns for personal protection also had to leave them behind with his bodyguards when he entered prison precincts. All his bodyguards were EPDP cadres.Within the prisons the chief jailor RRA Fernando also joined Devananda, Velayutham, Gamalath and Leelaratna in interacting with  the prisoners.",
    "The Tamil detenues wre housed  in four major blocks or wards termed A, B, C, and D respectively.According to some reports the chief Jailor Fernando had advised Douglas against going into the wards and wanted him to get all fasting persons to come outside but Devananda refused saying that it was proper to go to each fasting person and assure him personally.",
    "Thereafter Devananda went through the wards of A, C and D meeting with each fasting detenue individually and getting him to call off the fast. Douglas personally gave each person glucose filled water as a symbol of the fast being ended. He also addressed the prisoners in each block other than B and also answered their questions.",
    "Devananda gave them a firm guarantee that the EPDP would ensure within one month. the beginning of a speedy disposal of their cases by the authorities. It would be a process of release or commencement of trial. He also assured them that the  EPDP would stop supporting the government if this guarantee was not honoured by the PA government.",
    "It was a matter of immense satisfaction to all concerned that the fast had been called off under amicable circumstances and the authorities were explicitly grateful to Devananda for diffusing an explosive situation. Devananda then looked at the time and exclaimed \u201c6.23 pm\u201d. He said that he had another important appointment in Colombo and prepared to depart from Kalutara after a rewarding day personally and politically. Leelaratna and Gamlath also took their leave of Devananda and went away.",
    "At this point of time a request was made to Devananda by the inmates of ward B that he should visit them too. Earlier Devananda had not visited Ward B for two reasons. Firstly no one from that block had undertaken the death fast. Secondly the inmates of that block were suspected of being hardcore LTTE. The prison guards themselves referred   to Block B inmates as \u201cKoti\u201d.But now Devananda was told that some of the B inmates had also begun a fast and that  they would appreciate his meeting them. This was a lie as events proved later.",
    "Devananda used to taking many a risk in his life decided then to visit B ward too. At this point the chief Jailor Fernando again warned Devananda not to go into the ward itself but get the detenues to meet him outside in the hall. Devananda agreed and so the B detenues started coming out into the hall. Although there were 234 in Ward B only about 150 came out the rest saying that they were not interested in talking to Devananda.",
    "Douglas, Maheswari and Fernando then went into the hall alone. Maheswary  Velayutham sat on a cement seat in the hall. She placed her files by her side on the cement seat.",
    "Douglas and  Fernando remained standing. Douglas was addressed as \u201cAnnai\u201d( elder brother) in friendly and polite tones. Asked as to what the situation regarding the plight of the detenues was Devananda began explaining. He had spoken for about two minutes when some of the detenues commenced their brisk operation.",
    "Some detenues surrounded Douglas Devananda. He was  suddenly tripped  from behind. Douglas fell.. Four persons then began attacking him with improvised weapons. Two others swiftly grasped the chief Jailor Fernando from behind one of whom gripped him in a vice like lock preventing all movement of his arms.",
    "About fifteen to twenty detenues formed a human wall encircling Devananda while the assault continued. Devananda in a bid to protect his eyes turned on his back. Then one of the assailants bent low and began stabbing Devananda on the back of his head with a knife crudely fashioned out of a metal plate. Hooks used to fasten roofing sheets were mounted on sticks and used as makeshift pikes. A metal rod used to fix a toilet in the prison also was used as a club. The worst was that block like chunks of cement were also used to beat Douglas in a primitive manner. Blood started oozing out of Devananda\u2019s head.",
    "Maheswary Velayutham saw what was happening and  began screaming and tried to rush to Devananda\u2019s side. She was seized by some of the detenues who began dragging her to the cells inside Ward B. Some caught hold of her saree and started yanking it. Fortunately  another group  of detenues came to Maheswary\u2019s defence.. These detenues overpowered the others and allowed a thoroughly bruised and dishshevelled Maheswary to get away.",
    "In the meantime chief Jailor Fernando managed to free himself and rushed outside to raise  the alarm. Prison guards rushed to the scene. First they tried normal riot control techniques. Finding them useless they began firing in the air and on the walls. A few bullets richocheted and struck some of the detenues injuring three",
    "Upon hearing the reports of gunfire Devananda\u2019s bodyguards got perturbed and wanted to go inside the jail. They were forbidden to do so, But the intrepid bodyguards possessing intense loyalty towards Devananda brandished their firearms and forced their way in.In their zeal to protect Devananda they attempted some unorthodox measures that were resisted by the prison guards.",
    "During this fracas the  248  B ward inmates retreated to their cells and locked themselves from within fearing the wrath of Devananda\u2019s armed bodyguards. Later these locks had to be broken by the regular Prison guards.",
    "It took some time for the Police to arrive. Devananda was losing blood fast. But remarkably he did not lose consciousness at the prison and even  conversed  feebly with his bodyguards. He lost consciousness while being taken to the Nagoda hospital, Kalutara. Taken to the intensive care unit he was given emergency treatment.",
    "Later in the night Douglas was taken to the Colombo National Hospital where he was given emergency neuro surgery for five and a half hours by a team of ten doctors headed by Dr. Sunil Perera.   Apparently the stabbing at the back of his head had damaged vital nerve centres. Also some  arteries and veins leading to the brain had been ruptured resulting in heavy haemorrage.  Devananda was  taken abroad    in mid-July for further medical treatment.",
    "Two detenues at Kalutara Krishnakumaran (No 4180) and Sriskandarajah (No4590) were  arrested immediately  by the police on receipt of information supplied by Prison authorities. Some of the improvised weapons used to attack Douglas were also  seized. The inmates of B ward were compelled to surrender the clothes they were wearing at the time of the incident for forensic analysis.",
    "President Kumaratunga ordered a  top level probe into the incident by the Police under the direction of the then DIG -CID, Punya de Silva. 20 detectives were deployed.Apart from the Police investigations ,Justice Minister Peiris also appointed senior Prisons Dept Official Paskaralingam to conduct an internal inquiry.",
    "Meanwhile the LTTE through its media outlets attempted  to project the attack as a spontaneous uprising motivated by the detenues\u2019 anger against Devananda for supporting the government. But evidence available to the sleuths  suggested that the assault was clearly premeditated.",
    "Apparently the attack was a result of a direct order relayed from the LTTE high command in the Wanni. The LTTE hierarchy  conveyed instructions to its operatives in Kalutara to attack Devananda or other Tamil leaders whenever they got a chance.The implementation of that directive was an autonomous decision taken by the local LTTE  leaders in Kalutara. The assailants were waiting for the opportunity and seized the moment to target Douglas.",
    "The cowardly and brutal attack on Devananda was condemned then by friend and foe alike. A mob attacking a single  unarmed individual engaged in a humanitarian mission to end a hunger strike was unacceptable. Prisons Commissioner Karaliyadde  told the media \u201c It is a dreadful incident, where a person who came forward to redress the grievances of the inmates had been mercilessly pounced on by the inmates,\u201d",
    "Well-known lawyer  Kumar Ponnambalam who  was appearing in courts for many Tamils detained in Kalutara announced that he would not appear for them any more.",
    "Devananda returned to the Island in September 1998 after medical treatment abroad. An identification parade was held at the Kalutara magistrate court. Some detenue suspects were mingled  with  civilians. They were then placed in two batches of 50 persons each. Devananda  identified two suspects from the first batch and four from the other. All six were remanded.",
    "Subsequently Sixteen persons were indicted.The protracted  trial dragged  on for many years. One of the accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced  while court proceedings went on against the rest.",
    "On 30 October 2017, Colombo High Court Judge  Piyasena    Ranasinghe found six guilty and delivered a sentence of ten and a half years imprisonment each. The other nine were acquitted.",
