*2024-08-04 02:39:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/pr-the-essential-ingredient-in-hoteliering-part-a/) · `en`

I consider Public Relations (PR) as one of the most important aspects in running any business. In the context of managing Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) during the early 1990s, I identified the following twelve segments of people with whom I needed to have good PR:

During my efforts to shortlist employee suggestions, ‘Establishing quality circles in all departments, to earn a national award’ was identified as a goal for 1991. Before formalizing quality circles, we initiated special clean-ups using the Sri Lankan village concept of ‘Shramadana’ (donation of time and effort). This practice brought a new sparkle to the hotel.

### Some wonders AI has created and dangers of negative repercussions

*2024-08-04 02:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/some-wonders-ai-has-created-and-dangers-of-negative-repercussions/) · `en`

If anyone in this audience was skeptical regarding my earlier assertion that engineering and technology underpin numerous innovations shaping our lives, this example should effectively dispel their doubts. So what is behind this success in this new generation of AI that we now experience? It is a technology called Deep Learning, a term that may be familiar to some of you.

What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a computer learning paradigm, inspired by the human brain’s neural networks, which are believed to process data iteratively, through layers. Similar to how the brain learns from data, Deep Learning algorithms also learn by processing data, through layers of interconnected computing nodes, refining their understanding with each iteration.

### My time at Sussex University in the mid-1970s

“Culture is like jam; the less you have, the more you spread”

The Central Bank of Ceylon had stringent forex laws and regulations in the seventies. In 1975, it approved 18 sterling pounds for me to take to England as a student and recorded the amount in my passport. The postgraduate studentship from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) of Sussex University paid my airfare, tuition fees, and living expenses.

I travelled to Karachi from Colombo on October 1. The connecting flight to London was delayed because the plane had engine troubles. I did not have money to make a call to IDS or ARTI about the delay. The plan was for someone from IDS to meet me at Falmer railway station (the nearest to the university) on October 2 in the afternoon.

Trump can’t figure out if Kamala is Black or Indian, calls her husband a “crappy Jew”

During the two weeks after President Biden’s ultimate act of patriotism in deciding not to seek re-election for a second term, the political climate in the United States has been energized with a number of totally unexpected and refreshing events.

Biden became the second man to decline re-election since Lyndon Johnson in 1968. The circumstances surrounding the decision by these presidents not to run for re-election had many differences, but forsaking personal ambition for the good of their party and country is the common theme that has distinguished their presidencies in history for their selflessness and patriotism.

### Court Orders on the Plantation Wage Issue

*2024-08-04 00:25:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/court-orders-on-the-plantation-wage-issue/) · `en`

On May Day, flanked by plantation sector legislators representing the Ceylon Worker’s Congress( CWC), President Wickremesinghe announced the increase of the plantation worker daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. His will was legitimized by a gazette notification signed by Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour. Twenty one plantation companies, collectively, filed a petition before the Court of Appeal, seeking the invalidation of the said gazette, on the basis that the unilateral and arbitrary decision by the minister violated the legal principles of natural justice.

On July 4, a three-member Supreme Court bench issued an interim injunction order, preventing the implementation of the said gazette. Clearly, the court considered that the plea by the plantation companies had merit. The latest court ruling, along with the two others delivered on the recent election-related petitions, is more egg on the president’s face.

### Less Known Facts on Kamala Harris

There’s no denying the fact that the Democratic presidential candidate and possibly the first woman president of the USA is hugely dynamic, very ambitious, a successful career woman, beautiful and feminine. Not only will Kamala Harris be the 47th President if she wins the race in November, which she can do as her ratings rises rapidly and Trump shows strain and yes, trepidation, which he tries to cover with his usual bluff and bluster. She may also be the first Black and South Asian American president; Obama being considered to be first African American Prez. A very significant fact is that powerful women are rallying around her and endorsing her strongly. They are led by Nancy Pelosi, recently 52nd Speaker of the House of Representatives. Jill Biden, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama are close behind; Hollywood stars too like Beyonce.

### Seven Days In Sri Lanka: My Mother’s Life & Shadows of Betrayal

Mother died three days ago. Or maybe it was the day before. I’m not sure. It feels surreal, as if she’s still present. Her absence is heavy, a palpable silence thick with the memory of her voice. In those last days, she would call out my name in the evenings at the Cancer Hospital. I flew back for her from the US to Sri Lanka. It was a gruelling 20-hour journey.

Upon landing, I was arrested at the airport. They threw me into a cramped cell with two others: a Tamilian and a man who had stolen copper wire to feed his sick mother. The wire was worth Rs.22,000 (under 75 USD). It is in my opinion a desperate act in a country declared bankrupt in 2022. The economic collapse has driven many to crime, with Colombo’s streets mired in gun violence and systemic corruption.
