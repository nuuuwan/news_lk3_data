    "The customer is the primary focus of any business. Even with the best intentions, companies sometimes fail to meet customer expectations, leading to dissatisfaction. This often occurs owing to the following issues:",
    "When a problem arises, customers usually contact the company right away, expecting an immediate response. Responsiveness plays a crucial role in shaping the customer experience. Customers expect their issues to be resolved on the first contact or at least within the shortest possible time. Therefore, decision-making power should be as close to the customer as possible.",
    "However, there are instances when the service provider genuinely needs more time to resolve the issue owing to internal or external factors. In such instances, keeping the customer informed about the progress on the process can ease their concerns. Ignoring calls or failing to respond to emails only intensifies the customer\u2019s frustration. As the saying goes, \u201cCustomers don\u2019t mind waiting as long as they are kept aware; what they dislike is being left in the air.\u201d",
    "Customers need clear and straightforward communication. This starts with active listening, where the intent is to understand the customer rather than simply respond. Proper listening allows you to comprehend the customer\u2019s exact needs.",
    "Confusing or ambiguous instructions can frustrate customers. For example: \u201cWe can manage without the original document, but it\u2019s better to have it. Anyway, bring the original.\u201d This kind of messaging leaves the customer unsure of what to do. Similarly, using too many negative words to create a positive impression can be counterproductive. For example: \u201cIt\u2019s not common to face this issue, which, unfortunately, you did here. Not that we won\u2019t take action to prevent your dissatisfaction.\u201d Such statements only confuse an already frustrated customer. Be simple and concise in your communication.",
    "Use terms and diagrams that customers are familiar with and that are easy to follow. Shorter, positively framed messages inspire action. For example: \u201cWhatever you purchase inside the supermarket, you are free to consume in the lobby area beyond the cashier point.\u201d This is a clear and appealing way to communicate that food shouldn\u2019t be consumed before payment.",
    "Accuracy in everything you do should be a habit, not just an action. Always strive to meet the customer\u2019s exact requirements. Customers value their time, money, and effort, and mistakes cause significant inconvenience. Adopting a practice like \u2018Check twice, do it right once\u2019 is beneficial for everyone. \u2018Paying attention to detail\u2019 is crucial as well.",
    "It starts with getting the customer\u2019s name right, correctly entering information into the system, and pronouncing names properly. A person\u2019s name is the most pleasant thing they like to hear repeatedly. Accuracy in the address, content, and context is essential for delivering a great customer experience.",
    "For example, sending an email that mentions an attachment, but the attachment is missing, or sending a letter that says supporting documents are enclosed, but some are misplaced, creates frustration. Over-relying on spell check can also cause problems when the wrong word is selected. Mistakes like using \u2018attack\u2019 instead of \u2018attract\u2019, \u2018massage\u2019 instead of \u2018message\u2019, \u2018sing\u2019 instead \u2018sign\u2019, \u2018apart\u2019 instead \u2018a part\u2019 or \u2018grate\u2019 instead \u2018great\u2019 distort the meaning. Misplacing a comma in a sentence can have serious consequences. For instance, \u201cHang him not, release him\u201d can be disastrously altered to \u201cHang him, not release him\u201d if written incorrectly. Accuracy should never be taken for granted.",
    "Understanding the customer\u2019s demographics is key. Once you have this information, you can offer solutions that are relevant and meet the customer\u2019s specific expectations. Anticipating the customer\u2019s needs and offering tailored solutions are essential for any business with foresight. Digitisation should not only lead to standardisation and automation but personalisation. Using a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system constructively can help facilitate customer value creation.",
    "For example, a bank notices that a customer\u2019s savings account has a substantial balance that hasn\u2019t been touched for a while. Using the CRM, the bank could propose moving the money to a fixed deposit, creating value for the customer. Focusing on creating more value for existing customers is often more beneficial than merely attracting new ones merely to meet targets.",
    "Asking customers for the same information repeatedly, despite already having it in the system, wastes their time and effort. Insisting on additional evidence for something already established can also be frustrating. Of course, requesting information is acceptable when it\u2019s necessary for strict compliance requirements. Most often these requests are being done for the sake of doing without serving any real purpose and adding no value.",
    "We often talk about \u2018digital convenience\u2019, but is it truly centred on the customer? Sending a payment reminder is useful but imagine a scenario where the customer has already made the payment and still receives a final reminder. A message that at the end says, \u201cIf you\u2019ve already paid, please ignore this message,\u201d creates unnecessary discomfort. The system should be capable of identifying completed payments to avoid sending irrelevant messages.",
    "In conclusion, while these common mistakes may seem minor, they can significantly harm the customer experience, sometimes even leading to broken relationships. These issues can be resolved by adopting an empathetic approach toward the customer. The key principle should be: \u201cThe customer\u2019s best interest is always in my heart, and I am passionate about resolving their issues.\u201d",
