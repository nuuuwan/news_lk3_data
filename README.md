### US to send anti-missile system and troops to Israel, Pentagon says

The United States said on Sunday it will send U.S. troops to Israel along with an advanced U.S. anti-missile system, in a highly unusual deployment meant to bolster the country’s air defenses following missile attacks by Iran.

U.S. President Joe Biden said the move was meant “to defend Israel,” which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1.

The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on Iran’s energy infrastructure.

Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder described the deployment as part of “the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months” to support Israel and defend U.S. personnel from attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed groups.

We are pleased to announce that the criminal case brought against Asia Capital PLC and some former employees by a Japanese investor, CC Trust Pte Ltd., has been summarily dismissed by the Magistrate’s Court on 2 October 2024. This authoritative ruling confirms what we have maintained from the outset: that the allegations were unfounded, misleading and without merit in fact or law. The expert legal team consisted of Attorney Uchitha Wickremesinghe, Thilak Maparapana PC and Naveen Marapana PC.

Filing a criminal case in what is clearly a commercial transaction reflects malicious intent by the complainant. This positive ruling in our favour underscores not only our innocence but also the harmful nature of the claims that have been made against us.

We wish to express our deep concern regarding the reputational damage caused by these unfounded accusations and the significant loss and distress this matter has caused to our company, our employees, and our stakeholders.

### IGP introduces transparent selection process for police foreign training programs

*2024-10-14 00:40:33* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/IGP-introduces-transparent-selection-process-for-police-foreign-training-programs/56-767929) · `en`

For the first time in recent history, the newly appointed Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Priyantha Weerasooriya has announced a transparent selection process for Sri Lanka Police officers applying for foreign training courses and workshops.

In an official communique last week, Weerasooriya called for applications from police officers for foreign training programs to be held soon.

Moving away from the traditional method where officers were handpicked by the IGP or nominated by senior officers, Weerasooriya has introduced a mandatory interview process to select officers based on merit and qualifications.

The previous system had long been criticised for favouring officers close to the police top brass, sidelining others who might have been more deserving. Officers have often complained about the lack of clear criteria in the selection process, which undermined fairness and opportunities for growth within the force.

The people must realise though that with AKD at the helm only half the battle is won. He needs the people’s mandate to control the parliament. He must have an able crew to help him navigate the choppy waters ahead. At this point the NPP are doggedly sticking to their plan of nominating qualified and capable individuals to attract the attention of the voters. Already the names of high profile academics and professionals are emerging as candidates. This is leading the other parties to scramble and gather similar types to represent them and mirror the opposite camp. At least one thing is guaranteed – an increase in the IQ and capability of the next parliament which will be like none before
