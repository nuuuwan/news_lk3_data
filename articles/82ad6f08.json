    "Presidential candidate of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has outlined his ambitious economic plans, including a goal to generate five billion dollars through the information technology sector and create 500,000 software engineering jobs.",
    "Speaking at a public rally in Ruwanwella, Dissanayake stated, \u201cThere is a need to build the economy, and it will take some time to see significant growth. However, we can achieve an immediate boost in the tourism industry. I plan to attract 4 million tourists, which will contribute to an 8 billion dollar economy.\u201d",
    "He also emphasized his plans for the IT industry, saying, \u201cCurrently, the export economy is valued at 1.2 billion dollars. My goal is to increase it to 5 billion dollars and create 200,000 software engineering jobs in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "He pointed out that currently, 50 percent of multi-day fishing boats are left stranded due to inadequate planning, resulting in substantial financial losses, estimated between Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 01 million for each boat. He emphasized the need for subsidies to support fishermen and to develop a strategic plan to effectively utilize the maritime resources.",
    "He assured that local farmers will be supported, stating, \u201cIf the farmers in this country are capable of producing the onions we need, we will stop importing them. We will only import rice necessary for the tourism industry; not a single other grain of rice will be imported from abroad.\u201d"
