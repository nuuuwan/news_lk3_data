    "Political parties that supported former President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the recent Presidential election are gearing up to contest the upcoming General Election under the banner of the New Democratic Front (NDF), with the \u201cGas Cylinder\u201d as their election symbol.",
    "United National Party (UNP) Kesbewa Electoral Seat Organiser Saman Rathnapriya, yesterday confirmed that all parties within the alliance had agreed to contest under the \u201cGas Cylinder\u201d symbol. Alliance member S.M. Chandrasena also echoed this sentiment, stating that the group was united in their decision.",
    "Wickremesinghe, who ran as an independent candidate in the Presidential election using the same symbol, will now lead his coalition into the General Election with this emblem, pending approval from the Election Commission. Former MPs who backed Wickremesinghe have signalled their readiness to run under either the \u201cGas Cylinder\u201d or the \u201cElephant\u201d, or another common symbol, should the commission\u2019s decision not favour their first choice.",
    "The final decision on the symbol and the structure of the alliance will be made after the Election Commission announces its stance. Former MPs and party members met at Wickremesinghe\u2019s Election Operations office on Flower Road, Colombo, for the second consecutive day to finalise these details. The meeting, chaired by Wickremesinghe himself, brought together key alliance figures in preparation for the forthcoming polls.",
    "However, should the bid for the \u201cGas Cylinder\u201d symbol fall through, the group has expressed willingness to use the \u201cElephant\u201d symbol, traditionally associated with the UNP, or another mutually agreed-upon emblem."
