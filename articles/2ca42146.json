    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said President Ranil Wickremesinghe has no chance of getting a one-year extension of his tenure as the Supreme Court has given a clear ruling in 2019 that the President\u2019s tenure is five years.",
    "Dissanayake told the media in Colombo that the President and his group were trying to create confusion among the people about the Presidential election.",
    "\u201cThe Supreme Court has given a clear ruling in 2019 when the then President Maithripala Sirisena sought Supreme Court determination of the President\u2019s tenure. The Supreme Court observed that the President\u2019s tenure is restricted to five years as per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake said the NPP never thinks that the President will get an extension of his term as per the ruling given by the Supreme Court in 2019.",
    "He said the NPP will defeat any conspiracies or tactics of the President and his group to secure power without facing the people.",
    "\u201cWe will not only defeat Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s conspiracies but we will defeat Ranil Wickremesinghe altogether,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cRanil has to face the Presidential election. The NPP will defeat all attempts to prevent the election. We request the people not to give in to the unrests and confusions created by the Government,\u201d he said."
