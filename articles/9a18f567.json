    "Nestled in the misty hills of Sri Lanka\u2019s Uva Province is a living piece of Pure Ceylon Tea history in the form of Dambatenne Estate. Sprawling across the verdant slopes of Haputale, this iconic estate holds the legacy of one of the most famous names in tea \u2014 Sir Thomas Lipton. Dambatenne estate is a place where past and present converge, offering visitors a unique window into the origins of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry and the enduring global reputation it continues to command.",
    "Together with the father of Ceylon Tea himself, James Taylor whom at the time of Lipton\u2019s arrival in then Ceylon, had already established Sri Lanka\u2019s very first commercial tea plantation and factory at Loolecondera Estate, the duo set about the development of Pure Ceylon Tea that continues to form the foundation of the brand today.",
    "Walking the estate\u2019s picturesque paths today, to the scenic bungalow in which Sir Lipton himself resided \u2013 that is still maintained in pristine condition 134 years later, visitors trace the footsteps of a pioneer whose passion for tea reshaped Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and revolutionised how the world consumes tea.",
    "Founded in 1890, Dambatenne Estate was selected by Sir Thomas Lipton for its ideal tea-growing conditions: cool temperatures, rich soil, and abundant rainfall. Lipton\u2019s visionary approach transformed these remote Sri Lankan highlands into a powerhouse of tea production, kindling a global tea empire that helped make high quality tea accessible to millions.",
    "Lipton recognised the unique advantages of Dambatenne estate to produce tea leaves of exceptional quality almost instantly. His radical approach of bypassing the expensive brokers controlling the tea trade allowed him to bring tea \u201cdirectly from the garden to the teapot\u201d, while still making it affordable for the average consumer. This ground-breaking model laid the foundation for Lipton Tea, a global giant in tea that has been synonymous with quality, affordability, and innovation for generations.",
    "Today, Dambatenne Estate spans a total of 873 hectares, including 376 hectares of tea and 183 hectares of forestry and high conservation sensitive areas. Following significant investments in replanting, over 74% of the estate\u2019s tea is now vegetatively propagated, which has significantly increased the production of tea.",
    "The estate\u2019s rich history and legacy continue into the present day, with locations like the iconic Lipton seat remaining carefully preserved a tourist hotspot. Famed as Sir Thomas Lipton\u2019s favourite vantage point, Lipton\u2019s Seat offers stunning panoramic views of multiple provinces including Handapanagala Lake and Udawalawe Lake.",
    "These sites are also being strategically developed, with a new tea centre being established at the location, to offer visitors from across the globe a chance to savour the living heritage of Dambatenne estate at the very same location as Sir Thomas Lipton himself.",
    "For over a century, the estate has infused care and craftsmanship into every batch of tea it has produced, standing as a living testament to Lipton\u2019s enduring legacy and the estate\u2019s pivotal role in the rich history of Ceylon tea.",
    "Dambatenne remains at the forefront of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry, it skilfully blends tradition with modern advancements.

Similarly, the company has embarked on a strict polythene-free policy within the property, while investing significantly in hydropower, solar, and biomass renewable energy.",
    "The factory at Dambatenne is a remarkable feature of the estate, being the longest tea factory in Sri Lanka. Situated at elevations ranging from 1,560 meters to 1,970 meters above sea level, the estate enjoys ideal conditions for cultivating high-quality tea leaves that contribute to its exceptional output. It produces an impressive 700,000 to 1 million kilograms of tea annually, showcasing the scale and efficiency of Dambatenne\u2019s operations while maintaining the highest quality standards.",
    "The estate also manages 183 hectares of forestry and environmentally sensitive areas, including 126.47 hectares of timber plantations located at high elevations above 5000 ft. MSL. These areas are not only important for conservation but are also being considered for sustainable timber harvesting and ecotourism opportunities. The potential for utilising forest areas for ecotourism, such as introducing cabins within these scenic locations, has been recognised as an exciting prospect for sustainable tourism moving forward.",
    "Innovation plays a pivotal role in the estate\u2019s operations today. Automated machinery has enhanced harvesting efficiency, ensuring minimal environmental impact.

    "Dambatenne\u2019s investment in corporate social responsibility initiatives is another cornerstone of its legacy. From offering scholarships to supporting local schools, the estate ensures access to quality education for the workers\u2019 children.
