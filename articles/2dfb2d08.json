    "Over 80,000 water consumers have had their water supply disconnected in the past year due to unsettled bills, National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said.",
    "A spokesman from the NWSDB expressed that accordingly, the water supply of a total of 80,970 out of around 3 million consumers were thus disconnected.",
    "Among them are 63,150 domestic consumers and 17,820 non-domestic consumers.",
    "It is reported that the NWSDB has to recover Rs. 1,909 million in arrears from the consumers whose water supply was disconnected and outstanding payments amounting to Rs. 6,118 million from the consumers whose water supply is yet to be disconnected.",
    "This include Rs. 182 million in arrears from hospitals, Rs. 175 million from schools, Rs. 116 million from the Sri Lanka Army and the police.",
    "The NWSDB further stated that the consumers whose water supply was disconnected can, however, get their water supply re-established by settling 25% of the due tariff payments, and continuing the remaining\u00a0 payments later."
