    "State sector workers will receive 50% from increased CoL allowance",
    "Doctors to get Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000",
    "University lecturers to receive 25% hike in their study allowance",
    "The Government approved a comprehensive proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to disburse State sector workers\u2019 allowances to alleviate the financial burden and sustain essential services.",
    "The approved plan includes disbursing Rs. 5,000 from the increased Cost of Living (CoL) allowance for State workers starting from January, along with doubling of Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000 from the same month. In addition, University lecturers will receive a 25% rise in their study allowance starting in January.",
    "Originally, the Budget 2024 outlined increasing the CoL allowance by Rs. 10,000 scheduled for payment in April. However, recognising the urgent need for relief for State sector employees amid the prevailing economic situation and requests from various stakeholders urged the Government to expedite the disbursement process.",
    "Justifying the move to extend relief only to the State sector workers, the Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena emphasised retaining skilled professionals and maintaining the quality of essential services.",
    "He outlined the importance of recognising doctors and university lecturers as human capital, stating, \u201cIf we don\u2019t provide them reasonable answers, they will also migrate and it will hurt the overall economy,\u201d he added.",
    "Gunawardena said the decision aligns with the broader goal of sustaining healthcare, education and other public services vital for the smooth functioning of the country.",
    "The proposal to this effect submitted by Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday."
