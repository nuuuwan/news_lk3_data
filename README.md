### APAC economies and commodity exporters most exposed to China stress scenario: Fitch

Fitch Ratings believes that economies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and commodity exporters would be particularly affected under a severe downside stress scenario in China. There would also be a dampening effect on international price pressures.

Fitch’s analysis released last week, based on internal modelling using the Oxford Economics Global Economic Model, sees vulnerabilities in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, through their strong economic linkages with China.

It also suggests Middle Eastern energy exporters, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and Oman, would see slower real GDP growth. However, this does not capture factors such as Qatar’s long-term LNG supply contracts, which we think should make its exports less sensitive to short-term shifts in Chinese demand, limiting the hit to its GDP.

Given the possibility of Donald Trump returning to power in the US, even the current level of Western support to Ukraine may not be forthcoming. And unlike Russia, Ukraine has no indigenous capability to sustain itself, whether economically or militarily.

On the other contrary, Russia, has been able to circumvent the sanctions and keep its economy humming, according the Vienna Institute of International Economic Studies (VIIEC). And there has also been no let-up in its military efforts.

### NPP support surge linked to opposition weakness

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The surge in the support for the National People's Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka can be attributed to the weakness of the Opposition, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.

The primary opposition should be prepared to assume governance. However, this opposition prepared prematurely.

Therefore, the emergence of a third party became prominent as uncertainty loomed over the effectiveness of the opposition.

As a result, the main opposition's only course of action may be to collaborate with the ruling party. If they choose not to unite without careful consideration, several key leaders from the main opposition may opt to join the government.

However, the selection of the common opposition or the President will be made by the Members of Parliament based on their personal opinions, but there is no relevance to being in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or any other political party.

The development of nutritional deficiency is equivalent to forming an evil cycle. The opposition leader added that this has a negative impact on the country's productivity.

### China technology giant Xiaomi starts electric car sales

March 12, (BBC)-  Chinese technology giant Xiaomi says it will start deliveries of its first electric vehicle (EV) this month - its first ever foray into the competitive automotive industry.

China's fifth-largest smartphone maker says it has 59 stores in 29 cities around the country to take orders.

It comes as a price war intensifies between firms like BYD and Tesla in China, the world's biggest car market.

At the unveiling of the Speed Ultra 7 (SU7) last year, Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said the company aims to become one of the top five car makers in the world.

The smartphone giant has said it will invest $10bn (£7.8bn) in its vehicles business over the next 10 years.

Mr Lei said the SU7 was "super electric motor" technology which is capable of accelerating faster than some Tesla and Porsche EVs.

Xiaomi is also hoping that the car's shared operating system with its phones and other devices will appeal to existing customers.

### When I Become The President

*2024-03-12 20:34:02* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/when-i-become-the-president/) · `en`

Long ago, about 65 or more years ago, when I was a school boy, I remember writing an essay on the above subject. Don’t ask me what I wrote in that essay I remember nothing. I never thought I will have to write another essay on the same subject after almost a lifetime. This time it is serious as it is about the life and death of a nation.

The thought of becoming the president of this country is pure nonsense and useless wishful thinking. But it gives me a free hand to indulge in creative writing or day dreaming. It certainly is not going to be fiction or an irresponsible bed time story. It will be very serious and I am going to put to work all the gray matter, what little still left of it in my brain and all the warmth and hope, not much really, still left in my old, betrayed, dried up and broken heart.
