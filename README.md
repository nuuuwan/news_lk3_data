*2024-06-27 17:51:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187115) · `ta`

In Sri Lanka, state-supported anti-religious minority activities have escalated, with police involvement. The U.S. highlighted these issues in its 2023 religious freedom report. Local majority communities claim state backing for violent incidents against religious minorities, especially Christians and Muslims. Christian groups allege harassment and restrictions on religious practices, with the National Christian Swiss Coalition Organization (NCEASL) reporting police and state official interference. Civil activists and media report arrests of Tamil National People's Front supporters for peaceful protests and ongoing surveillance and harassment of Muslims post-2019 Easter Sunday attacks. The government is accused of viewing Muslim and Christian communities as threats to Sinhala Buddhist dominance, leading to legal controls and arrests under the ICCPR law. Religious transaction registrations are criticized for being arbitrary, with NCEASL reporting nine incidents against Muslims and 13 against Hindus. Concerns also arise over the Presidential Secretariat for Archaeological Traditional Management potentially leading to land grabs in Tamil and Muslim areas.

There have been claims made that recoveries are not being pursued against borrowers with political connections.

“This is most definitely not the case, and any impression being created that banks are lending on personal connections and political influence, that parate laws are being abused and customers exploited, are misconceived, inaccurate, misleading and unhelpful,” the SLBA said.

### The Only Way Forward – STEM Research & Development – For A Productive, Future Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka will have elections soon. In fact, right now, the country is engulfed and is swirling in the vortex of election fervour. People still hold on to the expectation that democracy will hold sway. The daily discourses are dominated by nothing but the most dismal of news – about debt restructuring and how to squander the IMF loan. How unfortunate is that? Notwithstanding those, I want to point out that there is still some hope.

A Nature news item by Benjamin Plackett (2024) reported that ‘by the end of this year, voters in some 65 countries and regions will have gone to the polls. That means close to half of the global population will have had the chance to cast a ballot of some sort, including almost 360 million people across the European Union’. The same article says: ‘Not all of the world’s political procedures will be free and fair, but this year is still expected to represent the biggest manifestation of the democratic process in history’.

### Honduras ex-President Hernandez sentenced to 45 years in prison on US drug conviction

Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses.

The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds.

A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution.

He also said jurors saw through Hernandez’s “polished demeanor” during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense.
