### Helicopter crashes into radio tower in Houston, killing 4

*2024-10-22 08:11:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102841/helicopter-crashes-into-radio-tower-in-houston-killing-4) · `en`

Four people aboard a helicopter were killed when it crashed into a radio tower in Houston and burst into flames, officials said.

The helicopter went down just before 8 p.m. Sunday in a neighborhood east of downtown after taking off from Ellington Field, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away, Mayor John Whitmire said at a news conference. He didn’t know the flight’s destination.

Officials said no one on the ground was injured, and no nearby homes were damaged, though some vehicles were. The crash sparked a fire that burned about 100 to 200 yards (91 to 183 meters) of grass, officials said.

Firefighters at a nearby station heard the crash and responded, Whitmire said. He said it was a “terrible accident scene” and that the tower and helicopter were destroyed. Some area residents lost power, Whitmire said.

“It is surrounded by residences and that’s where we were very fortunate — that it didn’t topple in one direction or another,” Whitmire said. “And the fireball pretty much was isolated.”

2022 වසරේ රටේ ඇතිවූ දැවැන්ත ආර්ථික අර්බුදයෙන් පසු සහ ඉකුත් සැප්තැම්බර් මස පවත්වන ලද ජනාධිපතිවරණයෙන් පසු පැවැත්වෙන පළමු මහ මැතිවරණය මෙය යි.

### Irrational Behaviour Of RW & MR Vs Rational Behaviour Of AKD

*2024-10-22 01:26:08* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/irrational-behaviour-of-rw-mr-vs-rational-behaviour-of-akd/) · `en`

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behavior can be compared with the rational behavior of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD). Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost.

Given the parliamentary election on 14 Movement 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

### Sri Lanka’s road to global competitiveness: Insights from trade, energy, and agriculture policies

In 2023, Sri Lanka’s goods and services exports made up nearly 20.4% of GDP, with manufacturing exports contributing 14%.

This is not the first time that a regime changed, and the board members got marching orders from minions in their organisation who have now got close to the ears of the executive. People who have served with dedication have to leave like thieves at night even before a new board is in place. There must be a better way – not just for civility but for the benefit of the country

The State apparatus consists of the executive, ministries, departments and public enterprises. A regime change is signified by the election of a new President and the formation of a new Cabinet of Ministers headed by the President. A Cabinet reshuffle also signifies a change in leadership of a ministry within the regime.

*2024-10-21 22:40:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-low-productivity-trap-strengthening-skills-jobs-and-public-sector-efficiency-in-sri-lanka/) · `en`

Sri Lanka experienced six consecutive quarters of negative economic growth up to the third quarter of 2023. This downturn has had a direct impact on the labour market, leading to lower wage rates and discouraging workforce participation and skill development. As a result, productivity levels continue to fall, creating a vicious cycle known as the “low productivity trap”, which hampers further economic recovery.

### Should Sri Lanka allow politicians to play the pork barrel game in the future?

*2024-10-21 22:37:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Should-Sri-Lanka-allow-politicians-to-play-the-pork-barrel-game-in-the-future/4-768237) · `en`

Principally, every rupee spent by the Government should maximise the social welfare of the citizens

Pork-barrel politics can lead to a fragmented political system where representatives focus more on their individual districts rather than working collaboratively to address broader, more urgent national issues. It creates a system where narrow, localised interests dominate policy decisions

In the 19th century, barrels filled with salted pork were considered a significant source of food, especially in rural America. This was a food preservation technique to make the meat last through the winter. Another interesting fact is that not every family had the capability to own such a barrel full of salted pork. This means that owning a pork barrel also served as a symbol of a prestigious social class with greater access to resources.

Fair wages are essential to the financial security of workers, but can employers sustain a wage hike in a fragile economy? This article explores key milestones in Sri Lanka’s minimum wage legislation from 2000 onwards, examines the population below the poverty line, and discusses whether businesses can absorb the recent increases amidst the country’s economic challenges, including debt obligations and import restrictions.

1. Early legislative efforts: Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers Act, No. 36 of 2005

In 2005, Sri Lanka introduced the Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers Act, No. 36 of 2005, which required private sector employers to provide a monthly relief allowance of Rs. 1,000.

At the end of the (London security) course, High Commissioner Tilak Gooneratne, who had an appointment in the European Common Market in Brussels with Sir Christopher Soames, External Commissioner for the European Common Market, took me along with him. He knew Sir Christopher, who was the son-in-law of Sir Winston Churchill, quite well and was keen that I should meet him, and also see at first hand certain common market arrangements.

### Trump creates an even bigger threat than “immigrant vermin” – The Enemy Within

The American economy is the envy of the world – The Economist, Oct. 19, 2024

The November presidential election, a mere two weeks away, still remains deadlocked.

The Trump campaign keeps gloating that Trump has the confidence of the American electorate on two key issues – management of the economy and immigration.

This week’s Economist follows its headline as shown above with the sub-head that the American economy has left the economies of other rich countries in the dust.

Economists agree that during the last four years, the economy has performed remarkably well. The Biden/Harris economy has achieved a record job growth of 15.7 million new jobs within four years, the highest new job growth for a presidential term in history. Wages are increasing faster than prices – the annual inflation rate is now at 2.2%. The Federal Reserve Board reduced interest rates by half a point in September, and is expected to reduce rates another half point in November.

### The possible future of foreign policy in Sri Lanka

*2024-10-21 15:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-possible-future-of-foreign-policy-in-sri-lanka/) · `en`

The last two weeks suggest that the NPP is moving to the centre, most probably in a bid to grapple with the challenges of a slim majority. The new government has announced that it will oppose the upcoming UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka. This indicates that it is moving to embrace the nationalist space that was previously held by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family, but has since bifurcated, if not trifurcated. As Harendra Dassanayake and Rajni Gamage recently observed, the Sinhala Buddhist space in Sri Lanka currently lacks a leader. The NPP appears to have caught the most vocally articulate sections of this milieu.

### Kumar David: An Accomplished Academic and a Broadminded Marxist

*2024-10-21 15:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/kumar-david-an-accomplished-academic-and-a-broadminded-marxist/) · `en`

One by one the lights go out. In a span of seven months, Sri Lanka’s Engineering fraternity and the country’s progressive political fraternity have lost three of their kind, one after another. Chris Rodrigo was the first to go in March, then it was Bahu in July, and now it is Kumar David, the oldest of the three. Professor Kumar David passed away in Los Angeles, on Monday, October 14. He was 83 years old.

He had been in declining health for some time after a cataract surgery that did not go as smoothly as such surgeries do. But on his annual visit to Sri Lanka earlier in May, he seemed to be in good spirits, and he was closely following from LA the results of the September presidential election in Sri Lanka. He was obviously pleased with the results and would have been hoping to see their consolidation in November. That was not to be. His was a long life, well lived, yet the end came too suddenly and too painfully for many of us.
