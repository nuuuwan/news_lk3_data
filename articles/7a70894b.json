    "Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa accepting the support of former Army Commander (Retired) General Daya Ratnayake, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka expressed his strong displeasure over the move.",
    "Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka made these remarks during his participation in the protest organized by the SJB in Colombo yesterday.",
    "Sarath Fonseka disclosed Ratnayake's significant involvement in his imprisonment back in 2010 under the administration of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Expressing his concerns, Fonseka emphasized that Ratnayake's allegiance to the SJB, particularly given his past affiliations, raises questions about the party's direction and principles.",
