    "INSEE Ecocycle, Sri Lanka\u2019s pioneer in sustainable waste management, is continuing the beach clean-up efforts in line with its commitment to combating coastal plastic pollution through three recent beach clean-ups as part of the Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia (PLEASE) project. The World Bank funded the PLEASE Project, which was implemented by the South Asia Cooperative Environment Program (SACEP) with support from the\u00a0United Nations Office for Project Services\u00a0(UNOPS). It aims to catalyze actions that reduce the flow of plastic pollution into South Asian seas.",
    "So far, INSEE Ecocycle has completed beach clean-ups along coastal areas in Norochcholai near the Lakvijaya Power Plant, Nuraicholai Casuarina Beach, and Nimalapura. Over 700 kg of plastic waste in total were removed during the cleanups. \u201cEach clean-up is a reminder of the crucial role we play in safeguarding our oceans and preserving the natural beauty of our beaches,\u201d said Sujith Gunawardhana, General Manager of INSEE Ecocycle. \u201cBy actively reducing plastic waste pollution, we are making a tangible impact toward environmental preservation and fostering a mindset of responsibility and accountability in the community.\u201d",
    "Through these ongoing initiatives under the PLEASE project, INSEE Ecocycle continues to champion beach clean-ups and raise awareness of plastic pollution, encouraging communities to embrace the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle.",
