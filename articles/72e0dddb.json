    "Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet approval has been granted to import 1,000 vehicles only for the tourism industry to transport tourists, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "Addressing the weekly media briefing to inform Cabinet decisions, he said this was after taking into consideration that vehicles in the tourism sector engaged in transporting tourists cannot be used for more than six years.",
    "It is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the tourism industry is not satisfactory and sufficient, and the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the use of old vehicles as a result of the limitations of vehicles and essential spare parts, the Minister said.",
    "\"Therefore, the requirement of importing vehicles essential for enhancing the industry has been recognized considering the contribution to the tourist industry within the economic revival process of Sri Lanka.",
    "\"Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the proposal by the Tourism and Lands Minister to import 750 vans, both electric and hybrid, with seating capacity of 6 to 15. Moreover, there are another 250 buses with seating capacities ranging from 6 to 30, which are small and larger buses with seating capacities ranging from 30 to 45 for the transport of tourists without any special tax relief,\" Minister Gunawardene said."
