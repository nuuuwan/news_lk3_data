### Buddhist Way to Peace and Prosperity

*2024-10-06 03:08:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/buddhist-way-to-peace-and-prosperity/) · `en`

Economic and social policies based on Buddhist principles were the foundation of peace and prosperity in ancient Sri Lanka. A close examination of this Buddhist foundation would be of assistance to attain, once again, the cherished goal of peace and economic prosperity.

Economic and political theories before Western influence were based on two famous ancient treatises, namely, Kautilya’s Arthaśāstra and Brihaspati’s Arthaśāstra. They had one common feature, in that, under the title of ‘Arthaśātra’ both writers had written on politics and economics, leaving out the most important ingredient for any development process, i.e. the mental and spiritual development of man.

### Back to Paradise

*2024-10-06 03:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/back-to-paradise/) · `en`

Fewer things are more impossible than a 45-minute layover at Doha International Airport. Disembarking takes a good 15 minutes, while the gates close 20 minutes before the next departure.

When you do the math, you realise you need to have exceptionally strong, sturdy legs to get to your next terminal. And that’s without the burden of bulky bags and the fear of wondering what will happen if you miss your flight and you have to wait a couple of hours or even a day to go back home.

In my case, home lay around 3,000 miles away. Not as far as San Francisco is to Doha – a gruelling 14 plus hour flight that can exhaust anyone – but far enough to make you want to go there quicker.

I had not been homesick in the US – there had been enough and more programs and meetings, friends to meet and places to visit, that had kept me busy – but as I sat in San Francisco, I had felt the vaguest stirrings of wanting to go back, kick off my shoes, and just collapse on my bed.

### A pragmatic approach to governance: An independent citizen’s perspective on President Dissanayake’s recent appointments

“It doesn’t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice – Deng Xiaoping”

As a concerned citizen of Sri Lanka, I have closely observed the early days of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s (AKD) tenure. Elected on a platform of reform, transparency, and merit-based governance, his recent appointments to key government positions have sparked debate. Some argue that these choices contradict the very principles AKD campaigned on. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced and pragmatic approach to governance that prioritises results and effective leadership.

### Will there be an October Surprise to sway the 2024 election?

*2024-10-06 02:46:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/will-there-be-an-october-surprise-to-sway-the-2024-election/) · `en`

An October Surprise is defined as “an unexpected political event or revelation in the month before a presidential election, especially one that seems intended to influence the outcome”. Since 1980, there have been a few “October Surprises” which may have changed the history of the nation.

The phrase originated in 1980, during the presidential election season of that year. Militants in Iran had seized 66 American citizens from the US Embassy in 1979, and held 52 of them hostage for over a year. Jimmy Carter was the incumbent president at the time. His failure to have the hostages released was the main reason he was losing in the polls to Ronald Reagan. The hostage crisis occurred after the Iran’s Islamic revolution and the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty. Carter had planned to negotiate a last-minute release of the hostages which would win him the election. It never happened.

When I returned to Sri Lanka from Sussex in 1982, the Director of ARTI requested me to oversee farmer training programmes. He appointed me the first Editor of the Sri Lanka Journal of Agrarian Studies. I invited Prof B H Farmer of Cambridge University to write the inaugural article of the journal on changing scenarios of agrarian systems in Sri Lanka. He was a well-known expert on Sri Lanka’s Dry Zone agriculture. He was the author of Pioneer Peasant Colonization in Ceylon: A Study in Asian Agrarian Problems (1957). Farmer was the committee chairman who investigated the post-colonial development prospects of irrigated agriculture in the Dry Zone and contributed to revising and updating the Land Development Ordinance of 1935.

### Crisis in Sri Lanka-US relations, Janavegaya & Mrs. B separating politics from official work

(Excerpted from the autobiography of Dharmasiri Pieris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

One could not however easily get away from managing. Besides the day to day management that was necessary to maintain paper and information flows, one had to service important meetings and conferences. There was the perpetual follow-up of numerous matters, each day bringing new material. In the midst of all these, someone often created a crisis, which ultimately ended up with us.

One such, during this time was the strong attack made by the Finance Minister Dr. N.M. Perera, on United States PL 480 assistance to Sri Lanka, before a large gathering on May Day. To the Americans, this attack by a senior Minister and the Finance Minister on an important program of official assistance was indeed inexplicable and unfriendly. Chris Van Hollen the Ambassador was not unnaturally quite exercised over this.

### Nasrallah’s possible successor out of contact since Friday, Lebanese source says

The potential successor to slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been out of contact since Friday, a Lebanese security source said on Saturday, after an Israeli airstrike that is reported to have targeted him.

In its campaign against the Iran-backed Lebanese group, Israel carried out a large strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs late on Thursday that Axios cited three Israeli officials as saying targeted Hashem Safieddine in an underground bunker.

The Lebanese security source and two other Lebanese security sources said that ongoing Israeli strikes on Beirut’s southern suburb - known as Dahiyeh - since Friday have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack.

Hezbollah has made no comment so far on Safieddine since the attack.

Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said on Friday the military was still assessing the Thursday night airstrikes, which he said targeted Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters.

Indian Minister of External Affairs Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar says the political trauma Sri Lanka had to experience two years ago was a result of both internal and external factors.

Addressing a discussion organised by the U.S. think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Indian External Affairs Minister said conflicts in a specific region can have serious impacts on other regions of the world, especially the global south.

“The international economy today is fragile. I have travelled to various parts of the world which has had a very hard time for the last five years, where people have seen a visible sort of drop in the quality of life. I may mention Sri Lanka. I’ve been in that country, I’ve been going there from time to time. I think part of what explains political shifts there was actually the trauma that they underwent as a result of some sort of factors within their control, but some of it was not”, he said.
