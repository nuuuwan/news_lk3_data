    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Cigarette smuggling occurs across the country, and a better understanding of this is needed to develop policies to curb it, increase government revenue, and minimise adverse health impacts, a study by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS) has found.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s smuggling is a result of incentives given by high tobacco taxes. High import duties have also promoted corruption in the trade of other goods including foods in Sri Lanka analysts have pointed out.",

    "Maldives sees Sri Lanka-scale cigarette smuggling after import duty hike",
    "Sri Lanka smuggled cigarettes soared over 1 billion sticks 2024 amid tax hikes : CTC",
