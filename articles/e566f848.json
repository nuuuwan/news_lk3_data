    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake retained Finance Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana under the new cabinet after his National People\u2019s Power (NPP) secured a landslide in the parliamentary elections last week.",
    "Siriwardana was appointed as the Finance Secretary by former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 and continued under Rajapaksa\u2019s successor Ranil Wickremesinghe. He has been instrumental in the key negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and debt restructuring deals since 2022.",
    "Before September 21 Presidential poll, Dissanayake\u2019s NPP vowed to oust Siriwardana, citing adverse impacts of the country\u2019s economic policies. The NPP also said it will renegotiate with the IMF and external private bond holders on debt restructuring.",
    "Dissanayake, however, has retained Siriwardana twice \u2013 after both his election and the last week parliamentary election.",
    "But the President appointed Aruni Ranaraja as the new Foreign Secretary, replacing Aruni Wijewardena, who was appointed by former President Rajapaksa in May 2022 and continued under Wickremesinghe.",
