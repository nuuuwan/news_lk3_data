  "original_body_lines": [
    "Tonga\u2019s Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned in parliament on Monday ahead of a planned no-confidence vote in his leadership, capping a period of fraught relations between his government and Tonga\u2019s king.",
    "Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.",
    "His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between Tonga\u2019s monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010.",
    "A statement on the Tongan Parliament Facebook page said Sovaleni, 54, quit \u201cfor the good of the country and moving Tonga forward.\u201d Video from Tonga\u2019s parliament on Monday showed the leader making brief and emotional remarks in Tongan before the no-confidence vote was scheduled to take place.",
    "Sovaleni\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His leadership had survived a previous no-confidence vote in September 2023.",
    "In recent months, Sovaleni\u2019s tenure was marked by difficult relations with Tonga\u2019s head of state, King Tupou VI. Although the sovereign\u2019s predecessor ceded power voluntarily in the 2010 democratic reforms, Tupou VI retains powers to dissolve parliament, appoint judges and veto laws.",
    "The king at times made his dissatisfaction with Sovaleni apparent, including by withdrawing confidence in him as defense minister in February. Some lawmakers at first decried the king\u2019s pressure on Sovaleni and his foreign minister as unconstitutional, but both eventually resigned their posts in April \u2014 although Sovaleni remained prime minister.",
    "A month earlier, Sovaleni had been photographed at a traditional ceremony of apology to the king, but neither side publicly addressed the event. When Tonga hosted the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders\u2019 Meeting in August, the king was traveling abroad and did not attend the conference \u2014 a significant event for the small Pacific nation \u2014 which analysts said was a snub to Sovaleni and his government.",
    "Speaking to Radio New Zealand on Monday, Sovaleni did not signal a particular reason for his departure. Asked whether his decision was prompted by disagreements with the king, Sovaleni said that \u201cdifferences in views\u201d were normal.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s the reason,\u201d he said, according to RNZ, adding that he still did not know why he and Tonga\u2019s foreign minister had lost the king\u2019s confidence earlier this year.",
    "\u201cBut we still provide respect to his majesty,\u201d Sovaleni told RNZ. \u201cWhatever we do, we always consider that relationship. So maybe you can ask someone else.\u201d",
    "His successor will be selected by Tonga\u2019s 26 lawmakers in a vote. The parliament is made up of 17 lawmakers elected by the public and nine who are nobles, elected by a group of hereditary chiefs.",
    "Sovaleni entered parliament in 2014 and had been a minister since 2019. He led Tonga as the tourism-dependent country struggled to rebound from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, growing threats from climate change and a catastrophic 2022 volcanic eruption and tsunami, which battered beachfront resorts, homes and businesses around Tonga\u2019s 171 islands.",
    "A former senior public servant who also worked in the private sector before entering politics, Sovaleni is the son of a former Tongan deputy prime minister. He attended high school in New Zealand and studied at the University of Oxford and the University of the South Pacific, attaining master\u2019s degrees in computer science and business."
