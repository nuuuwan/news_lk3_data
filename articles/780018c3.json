    "\u201cVolumes in the FC business was driven by higher sales in the impulse segment which comprises of higher margin products. Both businesses recorded a sustained improvement in margins on account of lower raw material prices and electricity costs and the increased operating leverage, due to higher volumes, enabling absorption of fixed costs.\u201d",
