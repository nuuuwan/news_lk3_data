Since its debut in 2015, the show has become a strategic sourcing calendar event for buyers and industry leaders from across South Asia, ASEAN, MENA, and Europe. From fibres to fashion, processing to packaging, Intex delivers the full textile value chain, and this year, it\u2019s taking it all a notch higher, the organisers of the event said in a statement.",

    "A key vertical within the show, the 3rd edition of INMAC (Smart Technology and Innovation in Gar-tex Machinery) brings together next-gen Gar-tex machinery from Germany, China, India and Taiwan, each showcasing their manufacturing edge. From AI-powered inspection systems (Germany) and digital print/dyeing tech (China) to smart stitching solutions (India) and energy-efficient fabric finishers (Taiwan), the pavilion spotlights how intelligent upgrades are reshaping textile production for a smarter, greener future. As the official Sustainability Partner, Eurofins will bring global expertise in testing, compliance, and environmental certification to the show, helping manufacturers and brands implement sustainability with scientific integrity.",
    "But Intex is not just about products, it\u2019s about people and progress.

From conversations on Apparel 2030, bio-based fibres, circularity, and smart clothing, to critical sessions on talent development and sourcing strategies in a volatile global economy, IBF 2025 promises insight that will move minds and markets.",
    "As Sri Lanka accelerates its momentum as an ethical and innovation-led sourcing destination, Intex and Inmac continues to play a role in connecting global demand with regional excellence. By strengthening linkages, supporting digitisation, promoting sustainability, and building bridges between governments, businesses, and innovators, Intex Sri Lanka 2025 aims to become a catalyst for economic opportunity."
