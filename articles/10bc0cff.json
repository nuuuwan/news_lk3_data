    "Sri Lanka\u2019s education system, once a beacon of progress in South Asia with its high literacy rate, now faces pressing challenges. Disparities in quality of education \u2014particularly between urban and rural areas\u2014are widening due to outdated curricula, insufficient resources, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Socio-economic barriers contribute to higher dropout rates and unequal access to quality education, threatening upward social mobility.",
    "Globally, the 20th century witnessed a rapid expansion of public education, with curriculum development evolving in tandem with theories of social change. In Sri Lanka, education was instrumental in promoting national unity in the early post-independence period. Today, however, it faces growing demands for financial resources and accountability. Neo-liberal, market-driven reforms are reshaping education worldwide, placing further strain on systems already struggling to balance equity and quality.",
    "Education remains a cornerstone of individual and societal advancement. It promotes self-reliance, financial security, and social acceptance, while driving economic growth and improving employment opportunities. For Sri Lanka to harness these benefits, its education reforms must be comprehensive, inclusive, and grounded in evidence.",
    "Since the 1980s, the Global Education Reform Movement (GERM)\u2014a set of market-oriented policies\u2014has transformed education systems in Anglo-Saxon countries such as the United States, England, and Australia, and even in some transitioning economies. These reforms have introduced market-based schooling, high-stakes testing, and narrow curricular focuses on literacy and numeracy.",
    "Critics argue that GERM undermines the core principles of public education by creating disparities, limiting pedagogical diversity, and prioritising corporate management models. In Australia, for example, reforms linked student achievement to standardised testing such as NAPLAN, generating pressure on teachers without significantly improving learning outcomes.",
    "Such approaches risk promoting \u201clow-risk\u201d teaching that discourages experimentation and holistic learning. Effective policy reform requires more than performance metrics; it must also support teacher development, contextual sensitivity, and the lessons of historical practice.",
    "Finland has notably resisted GERM influences. It avoids test-based accountability, instead prioritising teacher expertise, creativity, and student well-being. Teachers are required to hold a master\u2019s degree, which ensures high professional standards and continuous pedagogical improvement. Finnish school principals play a crucial role in implementing reforms while protecting their institutions from external interference.",
    "The Finnish system\u2019s focus on equity, student-centred learning, and holistic development has attracted global attention, offering valuable lessons for countries like Sri Lanka.",
    "Cuba\u2019s education system is a highly centralised, socialist model that guarantees free and compulsory education for all children aged 6 to 16. Following the 1959 Literacy Campaign, Cuba achieved one of the highest literacy rates in the world. The system emphasises equity, national pride, and social responsibility, with a strong focus on teacher training and professional development. Schools operate within a unified curriculum designed to promote discipline, civic values, and community engagement. Post-secondary pathways include both pre-university and technical training, and all graduates complete mandatory social service, reinforcing the link between education and national development.",
    "In Australia and England, political expediency often overshadows evidence-based reforms. Market-based approaches, excessive reliance on standardised testing, and privatisation initiatives have widened inequalities and undermined the student learning experience. These cases highlight the dangers of prioritising short-term political gains over sustainable, research-informed reforms.",
    "Education is central to fostering social and community entrepreneurship. It equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and mindset to address societal challenges and build sustainable businesses. Curricula that emphasise critical thinking, social responsibility, and real-world problem-solving nurture individuals who are capable of driving meaningful change.",
    "By cultivating networks, partnerships, and mentorship opportunities, education empowers students to translate ideas into impactful initiatives. As societies confront increasingly complex social and environmental challenges, education\u2019s role in nurturing socially responsible entrepreneurship becomes even more vital.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s educational reforms must balance quality, equity, and relevance. Key priorities include:",
    "* Strengthening governance and leadership: Effective management structures and shared accountability mechanisms are crucial.",
    "* Improving teaching and learning: Investments in teacher training, professional development, and innovative pedagogy must remain central.",
    "* Promoting equity: Reforms should close gaps in race, gender, disability, and socio-economic status, ensuring all students have access to quality learning opportunities.",
    "* Linking education to economic goals: A skilled workforce drives economic growth. Lifelong learning, digital literacy, and adaptability will be vital to Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness.",
    "* Fostering civic responsibility: Education should promote democratic values, intercultural understanding, and social cohesion.",
    "Addressing educational disparities is fundamental to social equity and upward mobility. Sustainable education prepares individuals for dynamic labour markets, integrating technology, personalised learning, and 21st-century skills.",
    "Finland\u2019s decentralised yet value-driven approach offers a model of fairness and quality. Its holistic curriculum, minimal reliance on standardised testing, and strong support systems for struggling students foster equitable outcomes.",
    "Cuba, with its centralised socialist model, demonstrates the importance of political will in achieving universal access in education. Its robust teacher training programs and commitment to literacy campaigns offer further insights for Sri Lanka.",
    "Successive Sri Lankan governments, having recognised the need for reform, often proposed stakeholder committees and White Papers to guide change. However, reforms must go beyond consultation on paper; they must be genuinely participatory, drawing on the insights of educators, parents, students, and community groups.",
    "Closing or merging under-enrolled schools in disadvantaged areas could exacerbate dropout rates. Instead, reforms should focus on improving facilities, ensuring adequate transportation, and providing qualified teachers in rural communities.",
    "Education unions have called for a gradual increase in education expenditure to 6% of GDP. Targeted investments in curriculum reform, teacher recruitment, nutritional support for marginalised students, and equitable resource distribution will be critical.",
    "Education is more than an academic exercise\u2014it is the foundation of a just, prosperous, and forward-looking society. It equips individuals with the skills and values necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world while strengthening the social fabric of the nation.",
    "In Sri Lanka, meaningful education reform will require a broad, inclusive consultative process that transcends political cycles. Policies must be evidence-based, equity-focused, and aligned with long-term national priorities.",
    "Empowering the minds of today\u2019s students is the most effective way to shape a brighter future. Investing in education is not simply an economic imperative; it is an investment in the very future of the nation."
