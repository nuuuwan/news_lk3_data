### Why is it that Wijeweera's family is unable to provide security to Mahinda? - Ajith P Perera Question

*2025-10-07 04:27:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/227065) · `ta`

The security of his family has been confirmed by all governments to date after Rohana Wijeweera died. It is essential to ensure the safety of national citizens in any government. United People's Power MP Ajith P. Perera said the government should take steps to provide security to Mahinda Rajapaksa if the family of Rohana Wijeweera is provided with security.

He made this statement at a press conference held in Colombo on Monday (6). As he further stated,

Everyone should follow the Act to remove privileges for the President. But as a citizen of the country, he cannot eliminate his right to Mahinda Rajapaksa's security. The former president's pension and privileges are eliminated, but his security cannot be recognized.

The last governments, the current government and the future governments are responsible for ensuring his safety on the basis of being a leadership to complete the war.. Therefore, the removal of his security for political revenge is a false role.

### Outdated laws obstacle to resolving drugs shortages, says Health Minister

Health and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said that several long-standing laws and regulations are obstructing efforts to address the ongoing shortage of medicines in the country.

He noted that while some question why the Government cannot amend these laws despite having a Parliamentary majority, many of the regulations in question are not new but inherited from the British colonial period.

Speaking at the opening of the Vipassi Buddhist Centre at the Colombo National Hospital, Dr. Jayatissa stressed that legal reforms in the health sector must be approached carefully, as existing rules are interlinked and cannot be amended in isolation.

*2025-10-06 22:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/parental-intelligence-sri-lankas-first-parenting-ai-companion/) · `en`

The recently announced Parental Intelligence (PI), Sri Lanka’s first culturally relevant AI parenting companion, was developed to support parents and caregivers in manoeuvring the daily challenges of family life.

Compared to global AI platforms, PI was created locally for Sri Lankan parents and offers a safe, useful, and judgment-free environment where families can get advice on how to raise kids of all ages.

Knowing that conversations are never saved gives parents the confidence to voice concerns.

### Gaza ceasefire talks begin in Egypt

Delegations from Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday that the U.S. hopes will bring a halt to the war in Gaza, facing contentious issues such as demands that Israel pull out of the enclave and Hamas to disarm.

Israel and Hamas have both endorsed the overall principles behind President Donald Trump’s plan, under which fighting would cease, hostages go free and aid pour into Gaza, the closest they have come to an end to fighting.

The plan also has the backing of Arab and Western states. Trump has called for negotiations to take place swiftly towards a final deal, in what Washington hails as the closest the sides have yet come to ending the fighting.

“I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said in a social media post.

But both sides are seeking clarifications of crucial details, including over issues that have wrecked all previous attempts to end the war and could defy any quick resolution.

More than 100 million people, including at least 15 million children, use e-cigarettes, fuelling a new wave of nicotine addiction, the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning.

Children are, on average, nine times more likely than adults to vape, it says, based on available global figures.

The WHO’s Dr Etienne Krug said e-cigarettes were fuelling a “new wave” of nicotine addiction. “They are marketed as harm reduction but, in reality, are hooking kids on nicotine earlier and risk undermining decades of progress.”

WHO Director General, Dr Tedros, accused the tobacco industry of “aggressively targeting” young people.

“Millions of people are stopping, or not taking up, tobacco use thanks to tobacco control efforts by countries around the world,” he said.

“In response to this strong progress, the tobacco industry is fighting back with new nicotine products, aggressively targeting young people. Governments must act faster and stronger in implementing proven tobacco-control policies,” he added.

Her previous books have been on diverse themes like guide to mental health, translation of fictions, translation of rare but valuable books on economics, and biographies. In 2015, as I have explained in a previous article[2], she published the writings of the French economist and statesman in the early 19th century, Frederic Bastiat under the title Libertarian Economics. This was the first attempt to introduce Bastiat to Sri Lankan readers. All the copies numbering about 2000 were distributed freely to interested readers by the publisher, Sri Lanka Frederic Bastiat Society, of which Shapiro was one of the patrons. That shows the extent of her dedication for promoting sound and advanced economic literacy among the fellow Sri Lankans.

Israel’s foreign ministry issued a statement, accompanied by photos of Thunberg at the airport, saying all participants’ legal rights had been upheld and the only violence involved an activist who bit a female medic at Israel’s Ketziot prison.
