### Insurance regulation in Sri Lanka тАШdeveloping with limited transparencyтАЩ: Fitch Ratings

Sri LankaтАЩs regulatory environment for the insurance sector is regarded as тАЬdeveloping with limited transparency,тАЭ according to Fitch Ratings.

In a report, Fitch cited the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka which oversees domestic insurers.

It introduced a risk-based capital (RBC) regime in 2015, which was fully adopted by insurers in 2016. The regime required insurers to maintain a minimum RBC ratio of 120%, and those with a ratio below 160% are required to submit a plan to improve their capitalisation levels.

The commission also enforces the segregation of life and non-life insurance businesses and requires all insurers to list on the local stock exchange to enhance transparency. However, exemptions are provided to insurers whose parent companies are listed on a recognised stock exchange.

Resentment has been growing among the sizable portion of the Muslim community as a result of the NPP governmentтАШs failure to appoint a Muslim to the cabinet, and it appears that demanding a ministerial portfolio specifically designated for the Muslim community in Sri Lanka is reasonable from both a representation standpoint and historical context. It means it is not just any portfolio but the ministry that can lessen the historic problems facing the Muslim community. For example, the Ministry of Muslim Religious, Cultural Affairs, and National Integration and Communal Harmony. A dedicated minister could focus on issues pertinent to the Muslim community, such as Islamic education, Islamic economic development, Muslim cultural preservation, and inter-community relations with and between Christians, Buddhists, and other religious groups that might otherwise be overlooked in broader governmental agendas.

### Book industry renews call for exemption from VAT, citing serious concerns

Sri LankaтАЩs book industry has renewed its call for books to be exempt from tax, with four industry bodies submitting a proposal to the new government for inclusion in the next national budget.

Urging the government to consider the financial as well as social ramifications of taxing sources of knowledge and learning, these associations representing publishers, writers, retailers, importers and exporters have called for books to be returned to the list of items exempt from tax, as was the case before 1st January 2024.

In their proposal, the four associations pointed out that with all inputs for the publishing industry with the exception of local labour being imported, Sri LankaтАЩs book industry is already taxed at 33.045%, and the imposition of a value-added tax (VAT) of 18% at the point of sale has made books unaffordable to many, and is putting small-scale publishers out of business.
