### Six including minor killed in Tamil Nadu hospital fire

*2024-12-13 07:51:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104200/six-including-minor-killed-in-tamil-nadu-hospital-fire) ¬∑ `en`

At least six persons, including a minor boy, were killed in a fire accident at a private hospital in this district on Thursday, police and Fire department officials said.

All the six were found unconscious in a lift, they said. They were rushed to a hospital where they were declared dead by doctors.

The victims suffocated to death and the Fire and Rescue Services personnel found them inside the lift after evacuating about 30 in-patients of the hospital. The evacuated persons have been admitted in the district GH, the officials added.

The fire was suspected to have been caused by an electrical short circuit, police said citing initial probe.

TV visuals showed fire and smoke billowing from the hospital building, with fire tenders pressed into service to put down the flames.

### Who guards the guards?

The Opposition continues to crank up pressure on Speaker Asoka Ranwala to resign over what it calls his false claim to have a doctorate. The JVP-led NPP government may have expected its opponents‚Äô campaign against the Speaker to fizzle out with the passage of time. In this country, controversies crop up at such a rate that one finds it well-nigh impossible to keep track of them, and that may be the reason why the government has chosen to remain silent on the issue of the Speaker‚Äôs educational qualifications. But the Opposition remains maniacally focused on the Speaker‚Äôs claim in question, and SJB MP Ajith Perera has gone on record as saying that unless Ranwala resigns forthwith, the Opposition will be compelled to move a motion of no confidence against him. The government has sought to make light of the situation, but in vain.

Reform of the MMDA will represent all these progressive aspects: Islamic legal jurisprudence, constitutional protections, universal human rights and basic human compassion and fairness.

President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It‚Äôs the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.

The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.

Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017.

### Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children

The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.

The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to ‚Äúcommunity outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders‚Äù and will act as a deterrent.

But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.

The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.

The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the ‚Äúrights of victims‚Äù ahead of ‚Äúthe rights of criminals‚Äù.
