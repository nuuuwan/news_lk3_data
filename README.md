### AKD-NPP’s March of Folly: Deeper into the debt labyrinth

*2024-12-12 05:58:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-NPP-s-March-of-Folly-Deeper-into-the-debt-labyrinth/4-770416) · `en`

However formidable, even brilliant, a leader and protagonist in the national political arena President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is, dialectics in general and the dialectics of the debt deal in particular, will undermine and undo AKD-NPP rule. A contradiction lies embedded at the very heart of the Government between the NPP’s progressive political sociology—its generational and gender configuration—and its regressive political economy. AKD and the NPP’s economic decisions; their choice of economic strategy and model; their economic turn, will erode and disintegrate the NPP social bloc and vote-base—and cannot but do so. Anura is determined, but the economy is the determinant.

In sports, underperforming men are not accused of being feminine – it is the over performing females who capture the limelight

The binary division of boys and girls is similar to black and white to most of us. However, the controversy at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, in the boxing category for women, has raised questions regarding the sex of the Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and the Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting. The controversy flared up when Imane Khelif competed against the Italian boxer, Angela Carini, who quit the fight after just 46 seconds saying that she had never been hit so hard in her boxing career.

While investing in the share market carries risk, there are clear long-term rewards for those who enter it with discipline

Sri Lanka’s equity market as measured by the Colombo Stock Exchange is hitting new highs, in a wave of political and economic optimism. Buoyed by expectations of stronger than expected economic growth and fuelled by lower interest rates, the benchmark stock market index the ASPI (All Share Price Index) sparkles this December like a Christmas ornament. Market liquidity which appears on the way up and hopes of capital gains tempt individual investors to increase their risk tolerance and test the market’s waters.

### Liberal Youth Movement urges Govt. inquiry into academic qualification concerns of Speaker

The Liberal Youth Movement yesterday expressed its deep concern over allegations questioning the authenticity of the academic qualifications presented by Speaker Ashoka Ranwala prior to elections and during Parliamentary proceedings.

“These concerns have sparked significant public debate and raised serious doubts about the integrity of information shared by leaders with the electorate,” said the Liberal Youth Movement’s Co-Convener Namini Panditha in a statement.

While academic qualifications are not mandatory for holding the position of a Member of Parliament or Speaker, such titles carry weight and are often used to influence voters and enhance political credibility. Misrepresentation of credentials undermines public trust and tarnishes the democratic process.

ඒ, ශ්‍රී ලංකා රජය සහ ඉතාලි රජය අතර පැවති ද්විපාර්ශ්වික ගිවිසුමක් අනුව ය.

### 2024-12-11 (Wednesday)

### Beat the Heat…

*2024-12-11 23:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/beat-the-heat/) · `en`

Phew! It’s terribly hot when you venture out and your skin is at an exposed danger of the ultraviolet rays.

Yes, we can’t stop ourselves from stepping out, but you can protect yourself from the harmful rays.

Application of fresh aloe vera gel to the skin helps to soothe and heal sunburn. Aloe vera contains zinc, which is actually anti-inflammatory.

Papaya pulp can be applied on the skin, like a mask…washing it off after 20 minutes. Papaya contains enzymes and helps to remove dead skin cells. Add curd or lemon juice to the papaya pulp to remove tan. Fruits like banana, apple, papaya, orange can be mixed together and applied on the face. Keep it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Papaya helps to cleanse dead skin cells. Banana tightens the skin. Apple contains pectin and also tones the skin. Orange is rich in Vitamin C. It restores the normal acid-alkaline balance.

🟩

The Sri Lanka PA (SLPP) Jaffna District Organizer Geetanath Kasilingam has said that the diplomatic community should temporarily suspend his contacts amid increasing allegations of the credibility of the educational qualifications of Parliament Ashoka Sabumal Ranwala.

During the recently concluded parliamentary elections, Ranwala had misrepresented his credentials by using the title "Doctor".

There have been accusations that the Speaker should not graduate from doctorate, which raises questions about his honesty and accountability.

"It is unacceptable to be a Speaker who portrayed fake qualifications," Kasilingam said. "The public should be interpreted on this obvious scam."

Kasilingam asked President Dissanayake to begin an immediate inquiry into the matter. He emphasized the importance of transparency and urged the authorities to quickly solve these issues to maintain the credibility of the parliamentary organization of Sri Lanka.
