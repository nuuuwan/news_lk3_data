Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran early on Wednesday morning, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fuelled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.

The Palestinian Islamist militant group and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed Haniyeh’s death. The Guards said it took place hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for Iran’s new president.

Although the strike on Haniyeh was widely assumed to have been carried out by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government made no claim of responsibility and said it would make no comment on the killing.

Haniyeh was killed by a missile that hit him “directly” in a state guesthouse where he was staying, senior Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya told a news conference in Tehran, quoting witnesses who were with Haniyeh.

He said this during a media briefing held in Jaffna on Wednesday (31).

I have a compassion for the country now. That is, there is a situation where riots may erupt after the election. There is no one who can get fifty percent of the Sinhala candidates.

But although many people say they are contesting in the election, Ranil, Sajith and Anura are the three war.

What kind of competition is going to happen between the three.If you ask what the party's role in this election is, I think that the party will be completely destroyed if an election comes back.

That is, it is my opinion that all their seats in the south will go to the JVP party.Their betrayal of this country is in the mind.

They have been raging in this country in particular, and they have raised themselves because of the war war.All of these are well known now.

### Concession to the importer and change the status of the national manufacturer - Sajith

He promises changes in the United People's Power regime to address these concerns.

Providing concessions to the importer and the burden to the national manufacturer must change the conditions.Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that if the current government does not change this position, we will change it in the United People's Power regime.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said this while addressing a discussion with traditional coconut oil producers on Wednesday (31).

Although a government policy that contains double policies that protect the manufacturer and consumers is required, today, the government's unreasonable policy is very unreasonable to impose an 18 percent tax on the domestic manufacturer and remove the tax on the imported coconut oil manufacturer and protect a few.

Although the five -star hostels will be given the right place to the national manufacturers, the national manufacturers and the producers have not been encouraged and supported.

We see the names of various institutions, especially social media, especially the food is good for cancer. That propaganda often is wrong. A meal cannot be advertised that you can often heal a disease. If so, formal clinical data should be submitted to the Ministry of Health Ministry authority. It is illegal to do that. "

Public sector workers’ pensions are paid by tax revenue, with 12% of Government revenue allocated for pensions

An IPS analysis shows that public service pensions are not a progressive welfare program, with half of the publicly funded pensions benefitting the top 20% wealthier group

Implementing a contributory pension fund is crucial to creating a more sustainable and equitable retirement system

The recent economic crisis has highlighted the need to address weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s economic policies for long-term structural change. One significant issue is the financial burden of public sector pensions. The Public Services Pensions (PSP) is the largest pension scheme for permanent public sector employees in Sri Lanka. However, its non-contributory nature has become a critical burden on the country, wherein pension benefits are funded directly from Government revenue, supported by general taxation.

The recent Supreme Court interim ruling has two components. On the first, that is restraining Deshabandu from “the powers, functions and responsibilities” of the office of IGP, the interim order is broad and straightforward.

The second pertains to the appointment of a suitable officer to act in the office of IGP. The SC ruling states: “...His Excellency the President may, should he wish to, consider making appointment, in terms of the law, of a suitable person to act in the post of IGP for the duration of the afore-stated interim order.”

Strictly speaking, this is only a direction given to the President, respecting the legal provisions under which he has the power to make acting appointment. In effect, it suggests to him that he may, if he wants to, consider making an acting appointment, in terms of the law.

It has been made clear that the President is in no mood to consider this direction of the Supreme Court, to go by the special statement made by the PM in Parliament today.

– ‘A Global Movement Against The Status Quo’ By Ian Bremmer, TIME, 5 Aug. 2024 –

Given the global trend as summed-up by Ian Bremmer, one of the world’s best-known think-tank gurus, a win for incumbent Wickremesinghe is virtually unthinkable.

Given the decision by Mahinda Rajapaksa’s SLPP to fend-off Wickremesinghe’s political piracy and field a candidate under the party banner, a Ranil win is logically impossible.

As PM in 2001-3, Ranil overstepped the mark and encroached on President Kumaratunga’s terrain. She tossed him out. As PM in 2015-2019, he did the same with President Sirisena, was turfed out, made a comeback thanks to the Supreme Court he now derides, and was evicted by the electorate.

Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam’s legacy is one of profound intellectual and humanitarian impact, rooted in a steadfast commitment to nonviolence, human rights, and inclusive dialogue

The Sri Lankan civil war ended with a brutal and decisive Government victory in May 2009, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians during the final stages of the conflict. If the LTTE and the Sri Lankan political parties had formed a consensus and worked to implement the constitutional reform proposals which Dr. Tiruchelvam helped formulate, the war likely could have ended much sooner, potentially saving countless lives

### A spotted affair: Has Sri Lanka over-promoted the iconic Sri Lankan leopard?

*2024-08-01 01:06:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-spotted-affair-Has-Sri-Lanka-over-promoted-the-iconic-Sri-Lankan-leopard/4-764988) · `en`

The Sri Lankan leopard – ‘panther pardus kotiya’ – Pic by Srilal Miththapala

Of all the charismatic animals seen in Sri Lanka, there is none that has created so much interest and popularity, than the Sri Lankan leopard. And today it has become arguably one of the most sought-after tourist attractions in the country. But is the leopard’s own popularity leading to its own destruction?

1 August is Sri Lanka Leopard Day, a day proposed by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka in 2020 to celebrate our very own leopard sub species.

So this maybe an overtime moment to reflect on the problems that the Sri Lanka leopard is facing today.

The Sri Lankan leopard is a distinct subspecies – ‘panthera pardus kotiya’ (after Dr. Sriyanie Miththapala 1966). It is the only large carnivore found in Sri Lanka, and is therefore the apex predator in the wild, with no threats to it other than man.

The Sri Lankan leopard, an apex predator and a key component of the island’s rich biodiversity, faces escalating threats from unplanned land use, wildlife crimes, inadequate penalties, and limited ecological understanding. With rough estimates suggesting fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the country, the conservation of this endemic subspecies has become increasingly vital.

### Understanding Sri Lanka president’s lotus-shaped dilemma

*2024-08-01 00:49:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/understanding-sri-lanka-presidents-lotus-shaped-dilemma-174646/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — On Monday July 29, the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) voted against backing President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the 2024 presidential election, opting instead to field its own candidate. The calculations that went into this decision are likely more complex than meets the eye and, given what is at stake, are worth discussing.

At the outset, it must be noted that in the absence of closely guarded inside information and scientifically sound polling data, any speculation on the outcome of a national election that’s still some time away has to necessarily involve reasoning built on publicly available information and a certain amount of guesswork. This analysis, therefore, attempts to work out the least unlikely rationale behind the SLPP politburo’s decision and its possible implications, based on information already at hand.

### Hair Growth Mask Recipe

*2024-07-31 23:13:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hair-growth-mask-recipe/) · `en`

Although I still haven’t finished with my Cucumber beauty tips, I thought I’ll tackle the hair growth problem this week and then go back to my Cucumber scene…probably next week.

You will need 01 medium-size onion (helps in stimulating hair follicles), a handful of curry leaves (promotes hair growth and strengthens hair roots), 02 tablespoons of coconut oil (moisturizes the scalp and adds shine), and the contents from 02 vitamin E capsules (nourishes hair follicles and promotes growth).

Heat the coconut oil in a pan, over low heat, and then add the chopped onion and curry leaves to the heated coconut oil.

Sauté them together until the onions turn translucent and the curry leaves become crispy. This helps infuse their nutrients into the oil.

Strain the oil, using a fine sieve or cheesecloth, to separate the solid particles (onion and curry leaves) from the oil. You should be left with infused coconut oil.

Pierce the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil into the strained mixture.
