### Through Tin Tin’s Eyes: The Calamity Bishop Rodrigo Is Visiting On The Church

When the decision was taken at schools take-over to keep St. John’s private, one of the key considerations was to be a witness for Jesus Christ and to serve society. Bishop Dushantha Rodrigo seems to have lost that vision in decapitating Fr. Daniel Jeyaruban by dismissal after blessing him only the previous night.

Worse, after suspending him without pay for over a year, the Church has demanded that he pay the rent and utility bills from when he was suspended without ever having told him at the time of suspension over a year ago. And the Church expected him to move immediately when his wife was in hospital with a prematurely born infant weighing under 3 lbs in a room full of occupied incubators and she had to come regularly from her ward to feed her. I believe that the prematurity was precipitated by the social stigma of his suspension and the indignation from the charge that he told people he was suspended when people asked him why he was not coming to school.
