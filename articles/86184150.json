  "original_body_lines": [
    "Republicans have won enough seats to control the US House, completing the party\u2019s sweep into power and securing their hold on US Government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.",
    "A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.",
    "With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the Federal Government and swiftly implement Trump\u2019s vision for the country.",
    "The incoming President has promised to carry out the country\u2019s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the Federal Government\u2019s most powerful tools and reshape the US economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.",
    "When Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority. Not this time.",
    "When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed.",
    "Trump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election.",
    "\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s good, we got to figure something else\u2019,\u201d Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trump\u2019s endorsement won the Republican Conference\u2019s nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a \u201cblowtorch\u201d to the Federal Government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an \u201cambitious\u201d 100-day agenda."
