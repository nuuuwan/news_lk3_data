  "original_body_lines": [
    "Repayment obligations \u2013 No immediate repayment obligations in equity financing. In debt financing however, the borrowed amount must be repaid within a time frame.",
    "Interest payments \u2013 In terms of equity financing, there are no interest payments but in debt financing regular interest payments are required.",
    "Debentures are essentially formal IOUs that companies give you when you lend them money. What makes them particularly attractive to investors is their predictable nature and security features. They offer fixed returns, meaning you know exactly how much you\u2019ll earn or can predict your return with certainty. Most debentures provide regular income through interest payments made every six months, creating a steady cash flow for investors. Each debenture comes with a specific maturity date when the company must repay the full principal amount you originally lent them. Perhaps most importantly, debenture holders enjoy priority treatment in the company\u2019s capital structure, which means if the company faces financial difficulties, debenture holders get paid before shareholders, providing an additional layer of security for your investment.",
    "Interest Rate Risk \u2013 When interest rates rise, existing bond prices fall since newer bonds offer higher yields. Long-term bonds are more sensitive to rate changes than short-term ones. This creates potential capital losses if you need to sell before maturity.",
    "Credit Risk \u2013 The borrower may default on interest payments or fail to repay the principal. This is particularly relevant to corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, and emerging market debt. Even government bonds aren\u2019t immune, as sovereign defaults can occur.",
    "Inflation Risk \u2013 Fixed-rate debt investments lose purchasing power when inflation exceeds the bond\u2019s yield. Your real return (after inflation) may be negative even if you receive all promised payments.",
    "Liquidity Risk \u2013 Potential difficulty in buying or selling a bond at a fair price, especially during periods of market stress.\u00a0This risk arises because some corporate bonds may have fewer buyers and sellers compared to government bonds, making it harder to execute trades quickly without impacting the price significantly.",
    "Event Risk Corporate restructuring, mergers, natural disasters, or regulatory changes can suddenly impact a borrower\u2019s ability to service debt, even for previously stable issuers.",
    "Prepayment Risk Borrowers may pay off debt early when interest rates fall, forcing you to reinvest at lower rates. This is common with mortgage-backed securities and callable bonds.",
    "Tips on How To Balance The Devil On Your Shoulder; Guide to Risk Management",
    "Build bond ladders with staggered maturities to reduce timing risk and provide regular reinvestment opportunities. Shorter-duration bonds (under 5 years) are less sensitive to rate changes. Consider floating-rate bonds that adjust with interest rate movements.",
    "Diversify across multiple issuers, sectors, and credit ratings rather than concentrating in single borrowers. Research credit fundamentals and consider professional credit analysis for corporate bonds.",
    "The Array of Debt Securities Facilitated; Invest In What You Believe In",
    "The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka serves as both the gatekeeper and facilitator of bond investments. Acting like a financial referee, the SEC creates rules and approval processes that allow companies to borrow money from the public through bonds while protecting investors from fraud and misinformation. Their dual role as regulator and facilitator has enabled the development of innovative bond markets, ensuring that when companies want to issue bonds, they must provide complete and honest information about their finances and intentions. Through this careful oversight and facilitation, the SEC has made possible the following bond categories that serve both investor returns and broader societal goals:",
    "The corporate bond market presents a fascinating risk-reward spectrum. At one end, bonds offered from established corporations with good credit ratings offer reliable returns slightly higher than government securities. At the other end, high-yield or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds from less financially stable companies entice investors with premium interest rates to compensate for elevated risk.",
    "The corporate bond market offers remarkable diversity, allowing investors to precisely calibrate their desired balance between safety and yield.",
    "Save the Planet and Make Profit: Unlocking Value Through GSS+ Bonds",

    "Sustainability Linked Bonds \u2013 Sustainability Linked Bonds differ from the other types of GSS+ Bonds in that their proceeds are not used to finance specific projects but are instead made available for general corporate purposes, with the issuer contractually undertaking to achieve predefined, measurable sustainability targets or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).",
    "Shariah compliant Debt Securities, commonly known as Sukuk, represent Shariah-compliant financial certificates that embody partial ownership in an underlying asset, usufruct, service, project, business, or investment.
