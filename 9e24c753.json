    "Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday revealed that 900 licences have been issued for the import of electric vehicles based on the amount of money legally sent to Sri Lanka by expatriate workers.",
    "He said that by issuing licences, it has been possible to bring in an amount of $ 100 million into the country.",
    "\u201cWe have introduced an electric vehicle licencing scheme to increase foreign exchange earnings, whereby we have issued licenses to nearly 900 electric vehicles. Over $ 100 million have come into the country through this effort,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "\u201cEven though the President had requested thrice to extend the period of issuing Letters of Credit (LCs) to import vehicles, the officials at the Finance Ministry had not taken any action to implement it. The same officials have been there at the Finance Ministry during the tenure of former Presidents Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa. We are not aware of the political agenda of these officials,\u201d Minister Nanayakkara alleged."
