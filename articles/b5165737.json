    "Chris Devonshire-Ellis is well-known for his work in foreign investment, but he\u2019s also a writer. Over the years, he\u2019s contributed to music magazines, interviewing legendary jazz and soul musicians like Luther Vandross and George Clinton. He\u2019s also authored several business books, expat stories about life in China, and even a travel guide to Mongolia. However, The Optimistic Kingfisher marks his debut as a children\u2019s author, published by The Jam Fruit Tree Publications.",
    "\u201cThe idea for the book came about when I had a few young Russian children visiting me in Sri Lanka. To entertain them, I started creating stories, and they loved them so much that they asked for them every night before bed,\u201d Chris shared. \u201cWhen the pandemic hit, I decided to revisit these stories, reached out to some artist friends to illustrate them, and eventually published them. The team at The Jam Fruit Tree Publications did an incredible job bringing these stories to life in print.\u201d",
    "The stories in Chris\u2019s book focus on the wildlife of Sri Lanka, featuring animals, birds, fish, whales, and turtles. With its colorful illustrations, it essentially serves as a children\u2019s guide to the island\u2019s natural world. Chris highlights how children often have fears of creepy crawlers, so he wrote stories about insects, explaining which ones are beneficial and which ones to watch out for. The goal is to encourage kids not to be afraid of going outside and exploring the rich outdoor life Sri Lanka offers. It\u2019s both educational and enjoyable.",
    "The Optimistic Kingfisher is written from an adult\u2019s perspective, intended for parents to read to their children at bedtime. Chris added some light-hearted jokes that may go over young kids\u2019 heads but would amuse adults. The book also reflects the spirit of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s works, like The Jungle Book. \u201cThere are three kinds of love in the book,\u201d Chris explained. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s the love of Sri Lanka, introducing its beauty. Then, there\u2019s the love of children, especially those from foreign countries visiting Sri Lanka. And lastly, it\u2019s a love story about my dogs, Clemmie and Winnie, whose adventures are featured as well. It\u2019s a love story for my dogs, Sri Lanka, and young children everywhere, and I hope readers feel that connection.\u201d",
    "Having moved to Sri Lanka over a decade ago, Chris feels deeply connected to the island. He purchased a bungalow in Unawatuna, explored the country, swam in the sea, and visited countless places. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have a large garden, redesigned by Geoffrey Bawa\u2019s former gardener, complete with a beautiful pond. Many of the stories about flowers and birds stem from what I saw in that garden with the children. So, these stories come from a very personal, home-centered place,\u201d said Chris.",
    "Now partially retired, Chris finds writing children\u2019s books more enjoyable than dealing with legal reports. Looking ahead, he plans to focus more on fiction and is considering a sequel to The Optimistic Kingfisher based on its reception. He also has ideas for books aimed at adult readers in Sri Lanka.",
    "The title story, The Optimistic Kingfisher, is about a kingfisher that would sit on a jasmine branch overlooking Chris\u2019s swimming pool at 9 a.m. Although the pool had no fish, Chris viewed the bird as \u201coptimistic.\u201d Another story centers around Clemmie, one of his dogs, who fell into a pond full of water lilies, mistaking the lily-covered surface for solid ground. These authentic, amusing memories inspired Chris as he developed each story.",
    "\u201cOnce you switch into creative mode, the ideas just flow,\u201d said Chris. \u201cI like to write without distractions. I need quiet and solitude. My wife is patient, the dogs are kept away, and my phone is off. Jeremy Muller at The Jam Fruit Tree Publications was incredibly helpful, even though I was out of Sri Lanka at the time. We managed everything online. The publisher handled the layout, proofreading, and all the details, making the process seamless.\u201d",
    "The book also stands out for its beautiful illustrations of animals and nature. \u201cSri Lanka has a rich literary culture, so I encourage anyone who has a book inside them to write it,\u201d Chris advised. \u201cI had people asking when I was going to publish the stories, so when I finally decided to go for it, it was a lot of fun. Rediscovering these stories after so many years was a really enjoyable process.\u201d",
    "One of the key messages of the book is to help children overcome their fears of nature. Chris explained that while Sri Lanka\u2019s wild creatures \u2013 whether fish, sharks, snakes, or insects \u2013 can seem intimidating, the book encourages children to learn more about them. The goal is to help kids understand that nature is full of wonders, and with the right knowledge, they can safely enjoy the outdoors. \u201cThe book is almost like a beginner\u2019s natural history guide,\u201d Chris said. \u201cI want to inspire children to notice the birds, flowers, and animals around them and ask questions about them. Who knows, maybe one day they\u2019ll grow up to be adventurous and continue encouraging others to appreciate nature.\u201d"
