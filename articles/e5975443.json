    "EOCNOMYNEX \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s president Anura Dissanayake calls for support for all citizens to take the country out of its current economic crisis, and promised to build the trust of those who voted and did not vote for him.",
    "\u201cWe do not believe that this this deep crisis can be got over by a government, a party or an individual,\u201d he said after being sworn in by the chief justice at the Presidential Secretariat.",
    "\u201cI have said before I am not a magician, I am an ordinary citizen born in this country. There are some skills and knowledge. My main task is to absord skills, absorb knowledge, take the best decisions to guide the country",
    "\u201cMy responsibility is to be part of that collective intervention.\u201d",
    "President Dissanayake won 42 percent of the popular vote unlike his predecessors, who got 50 percent, and also did not do well in minority areas.",
    "\u201cWe have a good idea about the size and composition of our victory,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my tenure, my task is to the people who did not support or did not trust to build their trust. You can see that in the future.\u201d",
    "He would also use foreign relations to further friendships with all countries.",
    "\u201cEspecially I know that our country needs international support,\u201d Dissanyake said.",
    "\u201cWhatever the power divisions we expect to act in the most advantageous way to our country.",
    "\u201cWe should not be an isolated country. We have to go forward with world in unity. We will not hesitate to take the decision in this regard.\u201d",
    "Dissanayake promised a clean political culture, where the trust of the public in politics and politicians would be re-built."
