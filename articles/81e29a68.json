    "At the Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association (SLGJA), Akram Cassim, a longstanding member of the industry, was officially announced as the newly elected President. In a speech that was both forward-looking and deeply appreciative of Sri Lanka\u2019s gem and jewellery heritage, Cassim outlined his vision to drive the industry forward, tackle challenges collectively, and capitalise on the unique legacy of the Ceylon Sapphire.",
    "\u201cIt is both a pleasure and privilege to serve you all in an industry that I have cherished throughout my life,\u201d Cassim began, expressing his gratitude to the members of SLGJA for entrusting him with the role of President. Acknowledging that the challenges ahead are many, he called for unity across all facets of the gem and jewellery trade to address shared issues and improve the industry\u2019s outlook. He emphasised that all segments of the trade\u2014from Ratnapura, the heart of gem mining, to the gem trading hubs of Beruwela and the gold and jewellery craftsmanship found in Kandy and Sea Street\u2014need to collaborate to strengthen the sector\u2019s overall growth.",
    "Cassim highlighted the enormous potential of Sri Lanka\u2019s gem and jewellery industry to become a significant foreign exchange earner for the country and a generator of employment across the island. He drew attention to urgent policy reforms required to reverse the changes that have hindered growth, weakened global competitiveness, and led businesses to consider moving operations abroad. \u201cIf we can have urgent reforms and reverse policies that have impacted our industry negatively, we can create a business-friendly environment that will allow our trade to flourish,\u201d he noted. Cassim expressed a firm commitment to work closely with the new government and other authorities to foster a business climate conducive to the growth of this vital sector.",

Cassim emphasised that the country remains one of the best sources globally for fine sapphires and more than 50 varieties of coloured gemstones. By promoting the \u201cmystery, magic, myths, and legends\u201d along with the \u201chistory, crafts, and skills\u201d of Sri Lanka\u2019s gem and jewellery legacy, the industry could create a compelling narrative to showcase to the world.",
    "The association envisions creating a comprehensive \u201cSapphire Shopping Experience\u201d for tourists, enticing them to own a piece of Sri Lanka\u2019s rich heritage. By romanticising the Ceylon Sapphire, Cassim believes that every aspect of the industry can be promoted, from the miners of Ratnapura to the gem cutters and traders of Beruwela, the gold and silver craftsmen of Kandy, the historic silversmiths of Galle, and the jewellery boutiques of Colombo.",

Having recently celebrated its centennial milestone, CJS has upheld its century-old tradition of excellence while continuing to innovate and set trends in the Sri Lankan jewellery industry His deep understanding of the trade and his passion for its growth add great value to his leadership role at SLGJA.
