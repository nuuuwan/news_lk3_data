    "(Reuters) \u2013 U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday she was \u201ceager\u201d to work with China on areas of mutual interest, including debt restructurings for poorer countries, and that multilateral development banks needed reforms before capital increases could be considered.",
    "In remarks prepared for a press conference before a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers in India, Yellen said her visit to Beijing last week helped put the U.S.-China relationship on \u201csurer footing\u201d and that the world\u2019s two biggest economies had an obligation to the world \u201cto cooperate on areas of mutual concern\u201d.",
    "She said she discussed Zambia\u2019s restructuring with her Chinese counterparts and, although it took too long to negotiate, differences were overcome.",
    "\u201cWe should apply the common principles we agreed to in Zambia\u2019s case in other cases \u2013 rather than starting at zero every time. And we must go faster,\u201d Yellen said, adding she hoped debt treatments for Sri Lanka and Ghana could be finalised quickly so the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could move forward with initial loan programme reviews this fall.",
    "She said a debt restructuring \u201cuser guide\u201d was needed for borrowing countries and other stakeholders to provide clarity about the process.",
    "Yellen said the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth trust, which provides zero-interest loans to the world\u2019s poorest countries, needed to be put on sounder financial footing. The U.S. Treasury is ready to assist the IMF to consider options for this, including using internal fund resources, she said.",
    "Yellen also laid out a number of next steps for the evolution of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, but said that any exploration of capital increases for the institutions can only be considered after implementing reforms aimed at expanding their role beyond poverty reduction to tackle global challenges such as climate change and pandemics.",
    "\u201cWe should build better banks, not just bigger banks,\u201d Yellen said.",
    "She repeated her estimate that multilateral development banks could collectively boost lending by $200 billion over a decade from internal resources through balance sheet reforms now being implemented or considered. They could boost this further by implementing recommendations from last year\u2019s G20 Capital Adequacy Framework report, she said.",
    "Among other World Bank reform steps, Yellen said she was pushing for a new set of principles that would allow the \u201ctargeted use\u201d of the bank\u2019s concessional financing for global challenges, including climate change and measures to boost such resources.",
    "She said she would like the World Bank to explore options for lending to sub-sovereign and supra-sovereign borrowers like the COVAX vaccine initiative.",
    "Yellen said the United States was committed to implementing a global corporate minimum tax deal reached in 2021 despite the lack of action by the U.S. Congress to do so. She said negotiations on technical details of the deal\u2019s Pillar 1 \u2013 reallocation of taxing rights on large multinationals including big technology firms \u2013 were \u201cvery close\u201d to completion.",
