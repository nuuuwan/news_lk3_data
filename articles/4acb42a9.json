    "Comfort Mattress Lanka will construct a 62,000-square-meter factory to make sponge mattress manufacturing on a 30-year renewable lease agreement with HIGP.",
    "It will import raw materials through global supply chain involving South East Asia and China and make the product in Sri Lanka for export.",
    "Firms in the industrial zone will be able to use the container terminal in the Hambantota Port, Chief Executive Wilson Qu said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThe container yard we are developing will handle transhipment and strengthen HIP\u2019s positioning as a gateway port,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe anticipate heightened interest in the industrial park over the coming years, and as Sri Lanka\u2019s economy stabilises, we foresee industries outside the port taking advantage of HIP\u2019s strategic location.\u201d",
    "The project represents significant opportunities for local employment in Sri Lanka.",
