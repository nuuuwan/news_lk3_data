The Hela Group’s revenue surged by 36.5% year-on-year to Rs. 23.4 billion in the second quarter of FY 2024/25. This was primarily driven by the contribution of the recently established Brand Licensing Division, following the acquisition of UK-based Focus Brands in January 2024. Sales for the existing private label manufacturing division were also supported by the ongoing recovery in demand from its key brand partners across the US and Europe.

### Rice-price does not follow Law of Gravity

The paddy and rice prices seem to be a political game but can be sorted out to a greater extent based on more coherent policies, planning and implementation mechanisms. Paddy and rice prices are socially sensitive issues that cause headaches for any government at different periods of the year. It is a pride of Sri Lankans to consume the rice produced locally. However, when the need arises, we will not hesitate to import rice to bridge the gap based on the requirement

### What has democracy got to do with unproductive coconut land?

*2024-11-18 00:25:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-has-democracy-got-to-do-with-unproductive-coconut-land/4-769341) · `en`

It is unlikely that democracy will yield greater returns solely because of the moral fortitude of the agents entrusted with governing on our behalf

It is broadly accepted that the Sri Lankan coconut industry, especially the smallholder segment, is highly unproductive. It has been reported that the average yield per hectare in Sri Lanka is less than half the yield in Andhra Pradesh where the climatic conditions are not dissimilar. This problem is not new.

Thirty years ago, I was asked to evaluate several information projects including the coconut information system managed by the Coconut Research Institute. The information system was exemplary, but I concluded that it all seemed pointless because the end objectives of producing more coconuts and improving the livelihoods of the growers were not being achieved. During the entire period of study, yields were declining. I was not asked to conduct evaluations after that.

### IMF must respect voice of Sri Lankan voters

The importance of achieving debt sustainability without compromising the welfare and long-term interests of Sri Lanka’s populace is clear

Lender awareness that Sri Lanka’s debt exceeded Government revenue by a factor of 10 underscores a stark instance of predatory lending practices. This highlights a profound failure to adhere to established norms of responsible lending, which require creditors to assess a borrower’s capacity to repay before extending further credit. By continuing to extend loans under such unsustainable conditions, creditors blatantly disregarded these principles, exacerbating Sri Lanka’s financial vulnerability and contributing to its current debt crisis. This pattern of lending not only violated ethical standards but also undermined the spirit of shared accountability between lenders and sovereign borrowers

### Economic challenges of new Government: Road ahead not smooth, but treacherous

AKD’s biggest woe will be to comply with the quantitative targets set for him by the previous Parliament

This is a historic occasion in Sri Lanka because in the past no Sri Lankan leader has been able to unite the country through the power of the ballot in this manner. Their attempt at doing so by the power of the bullet has miserably failed. But along with this electoral record which has elevated AKD and his supporters to the highest pedestal of the reign of power, there is an unshirkable responsibility cast on him as well

### Mandate of heaven on Poya Day

*2024-11-17 23:57:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Mandate-of-heaven-on-Poya-Day/4-769337) · `en`

Unlike in the past, voters cannot afford to remain aloof as mere onlookers and critics of what the Government does – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

When the date for election was announced there were murmurs among a group of Buddhist monks that the date would fall on a Poya Day, that it would be a day for people to attend to their religious rituals and meditation and that therefore the polling date be postponed. But the Election Commissioner stuck to his guns and as proved by the results voters thronged in hundreds of thousands not to the temples but to the polling booths and delivered an unassailable mandate to their favourite party of choice, National People’s Power (NPP) under the leadership of their favourite son, Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD).

It was indeed as the Chinese would say a mandate of heaven delivered on a Poya Day through the voting citizenry. To the Buddhists at least, NPP’s historic victory and the enormity of its size would appear a divinely blessed outcome.

### Ballot unites Sri Lanka in 2024

*2024-11-17 23:54:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ballot-unites-Sri-Lanka-in-2024/4-769336) · `en`

This Government and this President have the best opportunity in decades to truly unify the country like none other – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

How with the overwhelming mandate from the people of the north and the east, the NPP has a unique opportunity to unite the country

The Rajapaksa family was duly credited with uniting the country after winning a relentless war with the LTTE. In May 2009 the war was won and the country was declared united as one.

But for years afterwards, racism continued to feature in political campaigns and while the peace was won, question marks persisted regarding the hearts and minds of the northerner. And doubts remained regarding their actual integration with their southern brethren.

2024 may be seen as a watershed moment in Sri Lankan history as a Presidential election was fought where racism was not an issue. Language and religion did not play a role and none of the candidates had a divisive agenda.

Every ethnicity, religion, educational, competency, discipline and age demographic is represented. For the first time in the history of Sri Lankan politics a humble estate worker has been afforded an opportunity to participate in political decisions.
