    "The agricultural sector in the Tellipalai DS Division faces numerous challenges, including inefficiencies in land use, market access issues, and outdated practices. This policy paper aims to create a comprehensive approach that leverages modern technologies and sustainable practices, ensuring that local farmers are equipped to meet both current and future agricultural demands.\u00a0More than 200 Ac land released and around 100 registered farmers are keen to start the cultivation and require a coordinated approach to ensure success.\u00a0Honorable Presidents effort to open the one and a half Km direct riad also another positive step in this direction.\u00a0Departments and private sectors like Wikremaratne & Sons,\u00a0Keels, new investors and Cargills need to extend their support.",
    "Detail short and medium-term crops with minimum inputs need to be recommended by the Department of Agriculture Extension and the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centers through a participatory planning cum appraisal programme.\u00a0This should be an agribusiness programme.
