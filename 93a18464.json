    "The road safety projects are inclusive of workshops and seminars, not only for motorists but for all other road users, including schoolchildren.",

    "The State Minister also pointed out that at present data regarding road accidents, fatalities and injuries are collected by the Police Department, insurance companies, the Road Development Authority, Department of Motor Traffic and the National Road Safety Council, but there is no consistency in such data-gathering and there is no guarantee of the accuracy of this data. He therefore inquired whether the Association could develop a software for this purpose so that accurate data could be gathered.",

He extended an invitation to the Association to combine their operations with those of the Department.",
    "The State Minister further inquired whether the AAC wishes to change the Incorporation Act of 1957. But Association delegates did not want to give up their identity as the Association\u2019s incorporation is state recognized.",
