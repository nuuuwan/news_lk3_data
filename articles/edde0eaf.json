    "Another round of promise making has come to an end with two days to go before the next general election. Perhaps, the only thing Sri Lankan politicians do \u2018as if to the manner born\u2019 is to make promises to win elections, which have become promise-making contests in this country. If Machiavelli were alive, Sri Lankan politicians\u2019 adeptness at making promises and breaking them would compel him to put out a revised edition of \u2018The Prince\u2019. The Opposition politicians are making new promises while President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his team are promising to fulfil their election promises and making still more pledges.",
    "It is only natural that all political parties in the parliamentary election fray are desperate and troubled by a gnawing sense of uncertainty. Elections held under the Proportional Representation (PR) system can throw up surprises. Given the electoral strengths or weaknesses of the parties in contest, and the way seats are allocated under the PR system, the prospect of a hung parliament is looming large and has left political parties and their leaders scrambling for alliances.",
    "The JVP-led NPP did not succeed in getting off to a flying start after winning the presidency in September much to the disappointment of those who expected quick results. Sri Lankans are in a mighty hurry; they cannot even wait until traffic lights turn green! The NPP elevated the people\u2019s expectations immeasurably, before the presidential election, promising many things including huge fuel price reductions and making other essential commodities freely available at affordable prices. Above all, its failure to win the presidency outright, despite its claim that it was riding a massive wave of popular support, has apparently affected its parliamentary election campaign, which has seen a drop in voter enthusiasm.",
    "President Dissanayake, who stumped for the NPP throughout the country during the past several weeks, renewed a controversial promise in Vavuniya over the weekend. He pledged to release the \u2018Tamil political prisoners\u2019 in consultation with the Attorney General (AG). The Tamil Guardian has reported that JVP/NPP stalwart Bimal Ratnayake said in Vavuniya last month that President Dissanayake was \u201ccommitted to releasing all political prisoners\u201d.",
    "Interestingly, successive governments including the  Yahapalana administration, which Dissanayake\u2019s JVP backed to the hilt, have insisted that there are no political prisoners. In 2015, Yahapalana Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe declared that Sri Lanka did not have any political prisoners. He said there were only some LTTE suspects in detention. The JVP did not take exception to his claim. Rajapakshe has reiterated his position on the issue, according to our main news item today. In 2021, Justice Minister Ali Sabry, in response to an inquiry ITAK MP Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam made in Parliament about the total number of \u2018political prisoners\u2019 in Sri Lanka, denied that there was anyone in prison for political reasons. He said 12,848 LTTE members had been rehabilitated and released after the end of the war in 2009 and that 600 of them were child soldiers. He said some persons were being held in connection with ongoing legal procedures, which were time-consuming due to the complex nature of the cases. He said the government would expedite those cases with the help of the AG. The then SJB MP Mano Ganeshan accused the government of playing on nomenclature to evade the question of political prisoners, and called for the release of all those who were being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The NPP reportedly stayed aloof from the debate on \u2018political prisoners\u2019 at the time.",
    "What President Dissanayake, who is also the Minister of Defence, has said about \u2018Tamil political prisoners\u2019 is likely to be considered official, and his pledge to release them has already been picked up by the international media and human rights groups. So, it is incumbent upon the President to substantiate his claim in question by revealing the number of \u2018political prisoners\u2019 in Sri Lanka, if any. It is antithetical to democracy to hold political prisoners. Has the government mistaken some hardcore LTTE cadres for \u2018political prisoners\u2019? An explanation is called for.",
