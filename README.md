His doctor's degree must submit to the country in the next two weeks. Otherwise it is expected to bring a no -confidence motion. We haven't decided yet. We are going to discuss with the Opposition MPs group. If that happens, the National People's Power MPs will vote during their conscience during the no -confidence motion. Remble

### AKD-NPP’s March of Folly: Deeper into the debt labyrinth

*2024-12-12 05:58:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-NPP-s-March-of-Folly-Deeper-into-the-debt-labyrinth/4-770416) · `en`

However formidable, even brilliant, a leader and protagonist in the national political arena President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is, dialectics in general and the dialectics of the debt deal in particular, will undermine and undo AKD-NPP rule. A contradiction lies embedded at the very heart of the Government between the NPP’s progressive political sociology—its generational and gender configuration—and its regressive political economy. AKD and the NPP’s economic decisions; their choice of economic strategy and model; their economic turn, will erode and disintegrate the NPP social bloc and vote-base—and cannot but do so. Anura is determined, but the economy is the determinant.

The controversy flared up when Imane Khelif competed against the Italian boxer, Angela Carini, who quit the fight after just 46 seconds saying that she had never been hit so hard in her boxing career.

### Liberal Youth Movement urges Govt. inquiry into academic qualification concerns of Speaker

### ඉතාලි රියැදුරු බලපත්‍රය: 'ඩ්‍රයිවින් කරන රස්සාවක් හොයාගන්න තිබුණා ලයිසන් එක තිබුණා නම්. එහෙනම් මේ සීතලේ මැරෙන්න වෙන්නේ නෑ'

ඉතාලි රියැදුරු බලපත්‍රය: 'ඩ්‍රයිවින් කරන රස්සාවක් හොයාගන්න තිබුණා ලයිසන් එක තිබුණා නම්. එහෙනම් මේ සීතලේ මැරෙන්න වෙන්නේ නෑ'

වැඩි වශයෙන් ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයන් සංක්‍රමණය වන රටවල් අතරින් රටක් වන ඉතාලියේ වෙසෙන ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයෝ ආසන්න වසර දෙකක පමණ කාලය තුළ රියැදුරු බලපත්‍ර සම්බන්ධ ගැටලුවකට මුහුණ දී සිටිති.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ රියැදුරු බලපත්‍රය ලබා ගෙන තිබුණු ඉතාලියේ ස්ථීර පදිංචිය ලැබූවන්ට එම බලපත්‍රය ඉතාලියට වලංගු වන ආකාරයෙන් හරවා ගැනීමේ පහසුකමක් මීට පෙර හිමිව තිබිණි.

ඒ, ශ්‍රී ලංකා රජය සහ ඉතාලි රජය අතර පැවති ද්විපාර්ශ්වික ගිවිසුමක් අනුව ය.

නමුත් මේ වන විට එම පහසුකම ඉතාලියේ වෙසෙන ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයන්ට අහිමි වී තිබේ.

ඉතාලියේ අගනුවර වන මිලානෝ සිට කිලෝමීටර 350ක් පමණ දුරින් පිහිටි නගරයක් වන, පේසරෝ නගරයේ ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයෙකු වන නුවන් දිසානායක දිවි ගෙවයි.

2022 වසරේ ශ්‍රී ලංකාව මුහුණ දුන් ආර්ථික අර්බුදය හමුවේ බොහෝ තරුණ පිරිස් වෙනත් රටවල්වලට ශීඝ්‍රයෙන් සංක්‍රමණය වූ අතර නුවන් ද එම වසරේදී ඉතාලියට සංක්‍රමණය වූ අයෙකි.

Phew! It’s terribly hot when you venture out and your skin is at an exposed danger of the ultraviolet rays.

Yes, we can’t stop ourselves from stepping out, but you can protect yourself from the harmful rays.

Application of fresh aloe vera gel to the skin helps to soothe and heal sunburn. Aloe vera contains zinc, which is actually anti-inflammatory.

Papaya pulp can be applied on the skin, like a mask…washing it off after 20 minutes. Papaya contains enzymes and helps to remove dead skin cells. Add curd or lemon juice to the papaya pulp to remove tan. Fruits like banana, apple, papaya, orange can be mixed together and applied on the face. Keep it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Papaya helps to cleanse dead skin cells. Banana tightens the skin. Apple contains pectin and also tones the skin. Orange is rich in Vitamin C. It restores the normal acid-alkaline balance.
