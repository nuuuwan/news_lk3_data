    "The Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE), in partnership with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), has relaunched the Sri Lankan Corporate Health & Productivity Awards (SLCHPA) 2025, calling for a new era of corporate leadership in which employee health and wellbeing are recognised as core business drivers.",
    "The launch event, held on August 13 at Shangri-La Colombo, marked the revival of the awards after a five-year pause due to the pandemic and economic turbulence. This year\u2019s edition sees JETRO joining as a strategic partner for the first time, bringing Japanese expertise, international benchmarking and proven global best practices to Sri Lankan boardrooms.",
    "Delivering the keynote, JETRO Resident Representative Hiroki Oi said the return of the awards was \u201cnot just a beginning \u2013 it\u2019s a comeback\u201d, symbolising resilience, shared values and a renewed focus on people as the heart of economic progress.",
    "\u201cHealth is not optional \u2013 it is essential. Resilient companies are built on the well-being of their people. The path to recovery must be paved with compassion, innovation, and collaboration, Oi emphasised.",
    "He explained that Japan has been developing Health and Productivity Management for over a decade, making it a central pillar of corporate competitiveness. Today, over 60% of all large corporations in Japan practise it under direct executive leadership, with tens of thousands of companies applying annually for the Japanese national award.",
    "According to Oi, the approach is not simply about corporate wellness programmes, but a strategic investment that links employee health to productivity gains, profitability and long-term corporate value. The benefits, he said, extend to attracting top talent, improving retention rates, and strengthening brand reputation.",
    "This year\u2019s SLCHPA will also be supported by Japan\u2019s Social Health Strategy Research Institute, ensuring that Sri Lanka\u2019s evaluation framework is aligned with the latest international standards, including ISO 25554, issued in November 2024 for improving organisational wellbeing.",
    "\u201cThese awards will not only enhance the performance of Sri Lankan companies but also become a source of national pride, contributing to a wellbeing-oriented society. This aligns with the Buddhist concept of loving-kindness, Oi said.",
    "Highlighting global trends, Oi noted that the world is shifting beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) towards models that put wellbeing at the centre of sustainable economic growth. In Japan, where ageing demographics present unique workforce challenges, health and productivity management has proven critical to maintaining competitiveness while safeguarding social stability.",
    "He stressed that Sri Lankan corporates could leverage the awards as a platform to adopt these forward-thinking practices, ensuring their resilience in an increasingly interconnected and competitive regional market.",
    "COYLE chairman Manjula Wijesundera reiterated that healthy employees are the foundation of healthy businesses and strong economies. \u201cThe Corporate Health & Productivity Awards is more than a recognition programme \u2014 it\u2019s a movement. If you have a balanced lifestyle, that also leads to a happy family life, he said.",
    "Wijesundera explained that the awards were successfully held in 2019 and 2020, but had to be paused due to COVID-19 and the subsequent financial crisis. With JETRO\u2019s partnership, the event now returns with higher ambitions and a sharper international focus.",
    "Organising Committee Chair Mihiru Perera said a three-year MoU with JETRO will ensure the awards maintain world-class evaluation methods rooted in Japanese best practices. The judging panel will comprise nine members, including representatives from COYLE, JETRO, Sri Lanka Medical Association, WHO, JASTECA, and CIPM.",
    "Field evaluations, auditor verification, and workshops will form part of the rigorous two-phase selection process. Perera encouraged companies to see the awards as an opportunity to showcase their leadership in building resilient, people-centred workplaces:",
    "\u201cLet your brands be recognised not only for what they make or sell, but for how they treat their people. Your actions can inspire businesses across the island to put wellness first and, together, shape a healthier, more productive nation.\u201d",
