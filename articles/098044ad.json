  "original_title": "Why Prince William\u2019s support could be a turning point for Sri Lanka\u2019s elephants",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka, famed for its biodiversity and cultural heritage, faces an unprecedented challenge: safeguarding its most iconic species \u2014 the Asian elephant. With over 6,000 wild elephants, the island harbours the largest population outside India, yet their survival is under severe threat. Every year, more than 400 elephants and 150 humans die due to escalating human\u2013elephant conflict (HEC), driven by habitat loss, deforestation, and unplanned development. Conservationists warn that without decisive, coordinated action, Sri Lanka could lose half its elephant population within three decades.",
    "In this pressing context, Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has made a timely appeal to His Royal Highness Prince William, Prince of Wales, seeking his patronage and partnership in launching a National Elephant Conservation and Coexistence Initiative (NECCI).",
    "This appeal is far more than symbolic. Prince William is one of the most influential global advocates for wildlife conservation, with a proven track record of transforming commitments into measurable outcomes:",
    "Through United for Wildlife, he united transport and finance sectors to combat the illegal wildlife trade, leading to the landmark Buckingham Palace Declaration.",
    "In 2020, he launched the Earthshot Prize, designed to scale solutions for biodiversity and climate resilience.",
    "His longstanding support for organisations like Tusk Trust and Fauna & Flora International reflects deep engagement with community-based conservation.",
    "Prince William\u2019s global visibility, credibility, and convening power uniquely position him to elevate Sri Lanka\u2019s elephant conservation agenda onto the world stage.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s elephants are not merely a national treasure; they represent a globally significant subpopulation of the endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus maximus). Protecting them contributes to:",
    "Advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals on biodiversity and climate resilience.",
    "Meeting obligations under international conventions such as CBD and CITES.",
    "This is more than a domestic issue \u2014 it is a global ecological imperative.",
    "Elephant conservation is not just an environmental cause; it is an economic necessity. Wildlife-based tourism is a major pillar of Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry, with elephants as its flagship attraction. According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, wildlife tourism accounts for nearly 30% of nature-based tourism revenue.",
    "Conversely, human\u2013elephant conflict imposes a heavy financial burden. Crop losses, property damage, and compensation schemes cost the economy billions of rupees annually. A structured approach like NECCI could reverse these losses by promoting eco-tourism, creating rural jobs, and attracting sustainable green investments.",
    "Previous Governments have attempted fragmented policies to address human\u2013elephant conflict, but a cohesive, science-driven national strategy has remained elusive. NECCI seeks to change that trajectory by introducing:",
    "Community-driven conservation models, ensuring villagers are partners \u2014 not victims \u2014 in coexistence efforts.",
    "Science-led strategies, including habitat corridors, land-use planning, and data-driven conflict mitigation.",
    "International collaboration, leveraging best practices and donor confidence through credible global partnerships.",
    "Prince William\u2019s endorsement could serve as a catalyst, unlocking technical expertise, international funding, and visibility for Sri Lanka\u2019s conservation efforts.",
    "Following his recent meeting with the British High Commissioner in Colombo, Premadasa emphasised:",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s elephants are not just our national heritage \u2014 they are a treasure of global biodiversity. With His Royal Highness\u2019s leadership and conservation network, we can build a sustainable future for both wildlife and our communities.\u201d",
    "This appeal reflects a progressive justification: that Sri Lanka\u2019s conservation challenge demands international solidarity, science-backed planning, and leadership capable of mobilising global attention.",
    "Sajith Premadasa\u2019s call should be seen not as a political gesture but as a forward-looking strategy \u2014 one that recognises that protecting elephants is inseparable from safeguarding rural livelihoods, tourism, and ecological stability.",
    "The question now is: Can Sri Lanka\u2019s policymakers, global partners, and conservation leaders transform this vision into a sustainable, inclusive strategy for the future?",
    "(The writer is a telecommunications engineer turned environmental conservationist and documentary filmmaker, focusing on policy-driven wildlife protection in Sri Lanka.)"
