    "Ahimsa (Non-violence) is one of the cardinal principles of my life. I am a great admirer of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s life and work. Ahimsa was a cardinal principle of his life too. I met him on several occasions and studied his writings carefully. In November 1989, I delivered a lecture in London on Ahimsa to a meeting of the Joint Commonwealth Societies. On October 2, 1991, 1 spoke about Gandhi and Ahimsa, at a commemoration meeting bell in Colombo on Gandhi\u2019s birth anniversary. But here, I would like to present what I said about Gandhi first, and then what I said about Ahimsa.",
    "It was indeed very gracious on the part of the India-Sri Lanka Society to have invited me to speak a few words on this occasion, commemorating the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. It may be because very few in Sri Lanka, and even very few among the politician of India are alive, who lived",
    "in the era in which Mahatma Gandhi played such an important role in Indian and World History.",
    "It is possible for me to speak of some events that others may now know of or may not even have heard of. I am happy to have this opportunity of doing so.",
    "It has already been mentioned that Mahatma Gandhi, or Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869. He was born in Porbandar, a village to the North-West of Bombay, and was the fourth child of his father\u2019s fourth marriage! He (Gandhi) married Kasturba Bai at the age of 14. She was younger. The marriage lasted for 62 years.",
    "At the age of 19, he went from India to London to study law. He was there for a few years and came back to India as a full-fledged lawyer in 1891. The story of his life in London is stated in his biography and it is not necessary to refer to it now.",
    "When he was practicing in Bombay, he received an invitation from South Africa in 1893 to appear in a case and he decided to go to South Africa for a short time. When he was there, he found the life of a Black man different from what he had experienced in India. The White people in India treated the natives badly but in South Africa it was much worse.",
    "He appeared in Court with a turban and the-judge said, \u201cTake the turban off.\u201d He refused to do so. The judge said, \u201cYou cannot appear in this Court.\u201d He had to leave the Court.",
    "On another occasion, he was traveling by train. He bought a First Class ticket and boarded the train. After some time, some White people got in and said, \u201cGet out of this compartment.\u201d He replied that he had bought a First Class ticket. The White man used some words which I cannot repeat to this audience. Gandhi refused to get out. At the next station, they got the police and Gandhi was ejected. He was left on the station platform for a whole night, freezing in the cold.",
    "He was once traveling in what was the then called a bus. It was a horse-carriage vehicle. He was asked to climb up and sit with the driver because a White man was traveling inside the carriage. He refused. He was assaulted and pulled out. He found life in South Africa different, and saw how the Black people were treated there. Gandhi thought that he should try and help them because most of them were uneducated and a large number were also indentured labour brought from India.",
    "After some years, he decided to go back to India. On the day in 1894 he was to go back, he was given a farewell lunch. He heard that a law had been passed which prohibited Indians registering marriages, because Indians were marrying White people and this was the best way to prevent such marriages. All Indian marriages became illegal and the children became illegitimate. Various other laws were also being passed; some which prevented Indians from registering as voters. Gandhi was persuaded to stay. He promised to stay for another year but at the end he stayed for 20 years, up to the end of the nineteenth century, and the first decade of the twentieth century up to 1914.",
    "During his stay in South Africa, he began to think of the social and political life led by the Black people in South Africa and, in his own country, India. He was wondering how to educate them to free themselves. He published a small paper, and organized a competition to ask the people their views to suggest a name for the non-violent way he had thought of to free the people from bondage or apartheid, as it was called.",
    "The prize was ultimately won by his own son for the word \u201cSatyagraha\u201d. \u2018Satya\u2019 means truth and \u2018Graha\u2019 means holding, that is, \u201cholding to the truth\u201d. It is not a new word. \u201cSatya Kriya\u201d is a word used in the Buddhist vocabulary. When Gautama the Buddha was faced with certain difficulties, he had performed \u201cSatya Kriya\u201d-\u2018Truthful Action\u2019. By the power of his mental ability, which he called \u201cSatya Kriya\u201d, he was able to overcome those difficulties. When you attend a Buddhist wedding ceremony, you hear \u201cJayamangala Gathas\u201d\u2013\u201cHappy Happy Wedding Verses\u201d, being sung. They describe the \u201cSatya Kriyas\u201d performed by Gautama the Buddha.",
    "Our own king, Siri Sangabo, had performed a `Satya Kriya\u2019 when there was no rain. He had sat in front of the Ruwanweli Dagoba and decided not to get up till there was rain. His `Satya Kriya\u2019 brought rain. Later, when he abdicated and gave up his throne and went into the jungles at Attanagalla, his brother who succeeded him feared that he might come back as he was very popular. He announced a reward for anyone bringing the head of his brother.",
    "People started bringing heads to the King. A beggar came to Attangalla and met Siri Sangabo who was a mendicant there and related the story. He performed a `Satya Kriya\u2019 and gave his head to the beggar. The beggar took it to Anuradhapura and gave it to the King and got the reward, for people who were bringing false heads could not do so after that.",
    "Gandhi, greatly influenced by the Russian writer Tolstoy, on non-violence, started the `Satya Graha\u2019 movement in South Africa and it was a great success. All the Indians there, as well as others, flocked to him. He was able to dispel the fear of the people. When he said, \u201cBreak the law\u201d, they broke the law. They did not fear being arrested and going to jail. This went on and the whole tempo of South African politics changed and it was due to Gandhi\u2019s leadership.",
    "People in India began to invite him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to India? We are beginning our freedom movement. You have been successful in South Africa, why don\u2019t you come back. We do not know what to do. We are making speeches, we are sending memoranda. Why don\u2019t you come back and teach us how to regain freedom?\u201d",
    "In 1914 he decided to come back. Unfortunately, the First World War was going on at that time. He said, \u201cWe will have to help the British.\u201d Even at that time the Germans were not very popular. He said, \u201cWe do not want the German regime to come here.\u201d He went round the country but did nothing to hurt or hinder the British movement.",
    "There were occasions when he helped the people to perform `Satyagraha\u2019. One was when there was an agitation in Champaran in Bihar in 1917, where the people used to grow indigo by agreement with the British planters. They grew the indigo, spent all the money, but they had to share the crop and the profit. Three-fourths of the crop went to the British planter, and one-fourth to the man who grew the crop.",
    "There was great distress and Rajendra Prasad who was one of the Indians who lived there, said, \u201cWe must resist this,\u201d but did not know how. Gandhi came in and started the first `Satyagraha\u2019 movement in India. It was a great success. The British Government of the area decided to acquire all lands of the \u2018Satyagrahis\u2019. They acquired all their buildings, furniture and other assets. Ultimately, they were sent to jail. The peasants did not change. The British said they had had enough of it, and \u201ccame to terms; to planters and the peasants.\u201d",
