    "I capitalise or upper case my title because it is The Debate I write about, thousands of miles away in Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania between US contestants for the presidency. It was on September 10 at 9.00 pm and Cassandra listened to it on BBC News on 11th morning starting around 6.30. She is sure many of her readers did the same but dissecting it and expressing opinions cannot be boring.",
    "The debate was conducted superbly by ABC News, facilitated by moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. To Cassandra it was completely fair and unbiased. But the immediate war cry of the Republicans, denounced by Trump\u2019s son, was that it was a \u2018three on one\u2019 debate. Their contention was that the hosts were biased and questioned Trump while Harris was given plenty of time to express her views. This I felt was a case of the carpenter blaming his tools for a shoddy job done. Trump\u2019s people have to blame and malign unless he is treated with kid gloves and respect bordering on reverence given him",
    "The main subjects debated on were the American economy, abortion, migration, global warming, international relations, war in Gaza and Ukraine, Afghanistan, and of course the respective policies of Trump and Harris.",
    "The American economy was never so stable according to what Trump proclaimed when he was president. He said he fired any officer who was inefficient in his job, whatever position he held. Harris pointed out the jobs created within the four years of Biden\u2019s presidency and the advancement of technology and mass green manufactures such as electric cars. Trump derided the development of solar power etc., as too expensive. Harris said people had better medicare and social benefits and schooling and housing would be improved vastly when she became president. She said Trump had done away with Obama\u2019s Medicare legislation to which Trump replied he improved it.",
    "was hotly debated with Harris presenting facts such as Trump appointing three judges to the Supreme Court who rescinded Roe vs Wade judgment which allowed women to seek abortion within the first trimester with valid reasons for the request. Harris spoke so well on this topic justifying a woman\u2019s right over her own body and pregnancy. Trump went haywire. \u201cSo, you will allow abortion in the eighth, ninth month, seventh month?\u201d Harris mentioned that IVF treatment for childless couples was denied during Trump\u2019s tenure and to obtain a necessary abortion a woman had to go to other States until abortion was made illegal. She showed her humanity here and the humane policies of a Democratic government.",
    "Migration was hotly spoken on by Trump not only when the subject was under discussion but in answer to many questions on other issues asked him. He accused Biden and Harris for destroying the country by allowing thousands of migrants to enter the US with most of them being terrorists and murderers. He even said: \u201cIn Springfield people are complaining of the loss of their pets, and migrants are eating cats and dogs.\u201d Muir is said to have fact checked and challenged Trump to substantiate his statement with figures. Of course, he evaded that.",
    "One of the hosts asked Trump: \u201cAbout the march on the Capitol, do you regret anything connected with January 6th?\u201d He did not reply that question even when repeated and lied preposterously that it was a peaceful march and he did not incite violence. He denied culpability. \u201cOnly one was shot that day and by the police. I had nothing to do with it. The police who defended the Capitol were on the other side.\u201d He blamed Nancy Pelosi and the Major of Washington for the incident. Harris pitched into him but without any show of anger. She said he incited a violent mob. She said her government would \u201cturn a page and stand for law and order. He has said there will be a bloodbath if he loses the election.\u201d",
    "Which led one of the moderators to ask Trump whether and why he said he won the 2021 election and then concede he lost by a whisker. Trump replied: \u201cThere is proof I won. Elections are bad, allowing everyone and anyone to vote. The problem is the nation is dying.\u201d",
    "When debating foreign policy and the ongoing wars, Trump boasted that if he was in power there would have been no wars. He would have negotiated with Putin, Netanyahu and Hamas and no wars would have occurred. To which Harris scathingly said he wrote love letters to Kim Jong Un and would favour any dictator if that person praised him. She recounted the many visits she had made to Ukraine as VP; and heard many, even officers of the American armed forces, who spoke of Trump\u2019s pride and self-esteem and that anyone who praised him was his friend. Trump said Harris hated Israel, hated the Arabs too. Also, that she was worse than Biden and he was the weakest of all presidents of the US of all time. \u201cShe is a horrible negotiator.\u201d In this segment of the debate Harris did not shine like she did all through. She should have mentioned her husband is a Jew.",
    "One of the hosts addressing Trump said: \u201cYou said you can stop the war in Ukraine. How will you do it? What is your opinion?\u201d Trump replied: \u201cI will settle matters before becoming president.\u201d",
    "Trump was very critical of how Biden handled the situation in Afghanistan allowing American soldiers to die there. Harris countered this by saying Trump when he was Prez negotiated directly with the then and now Taliban leader \u2013 Hibatullah Akhundzad and even invited him to stay over in Camp David which is a resort where respected, notable world leaders are invited to.",
    "Climate change was discussed briefly. Harris reminded her audience that Trump had said global warming was a hoax. She commented the young particularly were concerned about the environment and dangers inherent. Her policy was clean energy.",
    "The racial issue came up when one of the moderators asked why Trump often brought up the issue of a person\u2019s race like Obama being Black and showing surprise on discovering Harris claimed to be Black. \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d he lied. She spoke of her parentage and growing up in a middleclass milieu with a very determined and disciplined mother, implying the contrast between Trump\u2019s background and hers.",
    "The issue of gun possession had Trump saying that Harris and Biden would confiscate everyone\u2019s gun. She countered this by saying she and her VP \u2013 if she were elected \u2013 both possessed guns. It is known that one policy issue in her future plans is about schools and schooling with free meals and safety.",
    "The 90-minute debate ended with the final statements of each. Harris said she would take the country forward charted by a new plan: children would be protected; COL would be brought down; American peace policy would be sustained worldwide; human rights, particularly women\u2019s, would be protected.",
    "Trump had no definite statement. He said Harris promises much and questioned what she had done in 3 \u00bd years. (The notes I took down gave me nothing from him. He rambled on).",
    "You can Google or read in the foreign press myriads of comments. Cassandra says the debate was excellently conducted and so were the moderators. Kamala Harris out debated her contestant and \u201clanded repeated blows on former President Trump\u201d. She was focused, gave clear definite answers to questions posed to her and was charismatic, emanating vibes of vibrancy, charm, firmness. She will make an excellent Prez. However, she faces two negatives with white conservative Americans: her being a woman and of mixed races \u2013 Jamaican and Indian.",
    "Donald Trump was a failure in the debate: rambling and vituperative with insults. He was brought many pegs down after being judged better in the debate he had with Biden.",
    "Locally, many debates were spoken about, challenges thrown by party leaders to their opponents, but none have been forthcoming.",
