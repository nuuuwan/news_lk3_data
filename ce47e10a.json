    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it was confirming an \u2018A(lka)\u2019 national rating of Sri Lanka\u2019s People\u2019s bank, along with a negative rating watch.",
    "Fitch Maintains People\u2019s Bank\u2019s National Rating of \u2018A(lka)\u2019 on Watch Negative",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 13 Jun 2023: Fitch Ratings has maintained the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) on the \u2018A(lka)\u2019 National Long-Term Rating of People\u2019s Bank (Sri Lanka) (PB).",
    "RWN Maintained: The RWN on PB\u2019s National Long-Term Rating reflects the potential for the bank\u2019s creditworthiness relative to other entities on the Sri Lankan national ratings scale to deteriorate. This reflects heightened near-term downside risks to its credit profile from potential capital and funding stress, as the default risk on its domestic debt increases while access to foreign-currency funding remains constrained.",
    "Debt Restructuring Weighs on OE: The impending restructuring of the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s domestic debt, in addition to foreign debt, and the ensuing risks to the broader economic environment could exacerbate risks to banks\u2019 already stressed credit profiles, further hindering operational flexibility. The negative outlook on the operating environment (OE) reflects downside risks that would stem from further deterioration in economic conditions.",
    "OE Risks Pressure Business Profile: PB\u2019s business profile reflects its elevated vulnerability to heightened risks in the domestic market, which continue to affect its ability to generate and defend business volumes. The bank curtailed lending amid tight liquidity, along with the deterioration in the sovereign\u2019s credit profile, led to the bank\u2019s share of net loans falling to 59.7% of total assets by end-1Q23 (2021: 70.3%).",
    "High Sovereign Exposure: PB\u2019s risk profile is affected by its significant exposure to the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile, which accounted for over half of the bank\u2019s total assets via loans, off-balance sheet liabilities and investments, albeit having reduced from end-2021 levels. This makes PB vulnerable to the sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position.",
    "Asset-Quality Stress: PB\u2019s impaired-loan ratio is the highest among Fitch-rated large Sri Lankan banks. The ratio, which includes some of the loans to state-related entities being classified as stage 3, rose to 17.4% of gross loans at end-2022 (end-2021:8.7%). We believe the bank\u2019s asset-quality metrics will remain highly conditioned by its large sovereign-linked exposures through its loans and off-balance-sheet liabilities. PB\u2019s large holdings of local-currency-denominated government securities also exacerbate risks to asset quality.",
    "Earnings Face Significant Risks: Fitch believes the sovereign default on foreign- currency debt and prevailing macroeconomic challenges increase the possibility of the bank becoming structurally unprofitable for a sustained period. This is despite a moderate improvement in operating profit/risk-weighted assets to 3.5% at end-1Q23 (end-2022: 3.2%), supported by impairment reversals on its foreign-currency loan book owing to exchange rate appreciation.",
    "Debt Restructuring Could Weaken Capitalisation: PB\u2019s regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stood at 12.6% at end-1Q23. The bank faces elevated risks to its capital buffers due to its large sovereign holdings and a high share of unprovided impaired loans. We believe the sovereign\u2019s potential domestic debt restructuring could have a significant effect on PB\u2019s solvency, and it may necessitate recapitalisation to restore viability in the absence of regulatory forbearance.",
    "Funding and Liquidity Pressures: We believe PB\u2019s overall funding and liquidity position is prone to sudden changes amid weak creditor sentiment, similar to its peers. Stress on foreign-currency liquidity has somewhat eased. Nonetheless, the bank\u2019s access to foreign-currency wholesale funding remains constrained by the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile. Any local-currency debt restructuring could elevate funding and liquidity stresses, and could raise the likelihood of restrictions being placed on banks\u2019 ability to service their obligations.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The bank\u2019s National Rating is sensitive to a change in the bank\u2019s creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers.",
    "We expect to resolve the RWN once the impact on the bank\u2019s credit profile becomes more apparent, which may take longer than six months.",
    "\u2013 significant banking-sector intervention by authorities that constrains the bank\u2019s ability to service its obligations",
    "\u2013 a temporary negotiated waiver or standstill agreement following a payment default on a large financial obligation",
    "\u2013 Fitch\u2019s belief that the bank has entered into a grace or cure period following non- payment of a large financial obligation",
    "A downgrade of the sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating could also lead to a downgrade of the bank\u2019s rating.",
    "A deterioration in PB\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers would also lead to increased downward pressure on the bank\u2019s rating, which is driven by its intrinsic financial strength.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "There is limited scope for upward rating action on the National Rating, given the RWN.",
    "The resolution of the Rating Watch with an affirmation could be driven by our view that risks from funding stresses have abated, both for PB as well as the sector, to the extent that we believe the banks\u2019 ability to service their obligations in local and foreign currency is not hindered.",
    "PB has a 1.78% equity stake each in Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd. No shareholder other than Fitch, Inc. is involved in the day-to-day rating operations of, or credit reviews undertaken by, Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd."
