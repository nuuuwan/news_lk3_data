Trump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below could be heard in the hallway on the courthouse’s 15th floor where the decision was revealed after more than nine hours of deliberations.

### “VFS” the whole lot

*2024-05-31 05:37:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/VFS-the-whole-lot/4-762401) · `en`

“Yes, real tragedy is never resolved. It goes on hopelessly for ever. Conventional tragedy is too easy. The hero dies and we feel a purging of emotions. A real tragedy takes place in a corner, in an untidy spot …” – No Longer at Ease (Chinua Achebe)

In the common usage, VFS has come to represent the concept of outsourcing, when the State or a private sector organisation decides that one of its functions is better performed by an outside agency, and more economically. As far as we are aware, VFS, the organisation in issue is in the business of providing visa support services, acting on behalf of certain States, which will make the final decision on who goes in or out of that country. The function of the VFS is purely administrative, collecting documents from visa applicants which are then sent to the respective embassies for decision.

### Quo Vadis (Where are you going) Sri Lanka?

Whichever way Sri Lanka chooses to go, will ultimately be determined by its core values

Sri Lanka, since independence has been on a road that was not quite destined to reach a destination. Then, after almost 30 years of independence, with light to moderate progress, the economy underwent a radical change in 1977. We were told that this would make Sri Lanka a developed country in a short time span.

Things did not work out as expected and the next four and a half decades brought us to bankruptcy. There is not much purpose in blaming others, when we ourselves were to blame.

What is clear is that there was a huge thinking deficit on our part, as we believed all the West was saying and advising about development and how we should be getting about it.
