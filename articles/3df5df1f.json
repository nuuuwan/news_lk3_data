  "original_body_lines": [
    "The controversial Online Safety Bill has sparked a geopolitical debate with the Russian Ambassador in Colombo Levan Dzhagaryan stating that regulations of the online sphere are solely a domestic issue of Sri Lanka, and that any interference in this internal issue by foreign powers is absolutely irrelevant and unacceptable.",
    "In a statement issued by the Russian Embassy in Colombo this morning (26), the Russian Ambassador in Colombo highlighted that Russia is currently following the developments pertaining to Sri Lanka\u2019s Online Safety Bill, which was passed in the Parliament on Wednesday (24).",
    "Dzhagaryan added that Russia also takes notice of all comments and reactions both from the domestic political sphere and among the foreign powers accredited in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Russian Ambassador\u2019s statement came hours after U.S. Ambassador in Colombo Julie Chung\u2019s reaction to the Online Safety Bill yesterday (Jan. 25).",
    "Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Julie Chung noted that the U.S. remains concerned about the potential impact of the bill, which was passed without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies, who mention that this legislation threatens freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy.",
    "She added that, in addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs.",
    "Ms. Chung further noted that the U.S. urges Sri Lanka to prioritise transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people."
