    "Thousands of people protested Saturday against Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza on the sidelines of the Venice Film Festival, seeking to move the spotlight from movie drama to real-world trauma.",
    "Organised by left-wing political groups in northeast Italy, the demonstration began in the early evening a few kilometres from the festival where top Hollywood talent from George Clooney and Julia Roberts to Emma Stone have walked the red carpet in recent days.",
    "The protesters, whose numbers AFP reporters estimated to be about three to four thousand, marched slowly to the entrance of the festival in the beachfront Lido district, waving Palestinian flags, as the Hollywood blockbuster \u201cFrankenstein\u201d was due to have its world premiere nearby.",
    "Protesters said the film industry should use its public platform at Venice -- the world\u2019s oldest film festival whose movies often go on to Oscar glory -- to focus attention on Gaza.",
    "\u201cThe entertainment industry has the advantage of being followed a lot, and so they should take a position on Gaza,\u201d Marco Ciotola, a 31-year-old computer scientist from Venice, told AFP at the rally.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t say that everyone needs to say \u2018genocide\u2019, but at least everyone needs to take a position, because this is not a political situation. This is a human situation.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe all know what is happening and it\u2019s not possible that it carries on,\u201d said Claudia Poggi, a teacher holding a Palestinian flag as people shouted \u201cStop the Genocide!\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine\u201d.",
    "The Gaza war was one of the main talking points in the lead-up to the festival due to an open letter denouncing the Israeli government and calling on the festival to speak out against the war more forcefully.",
    "The letter, drafted by a group called Venice4Palestine, has garnered more than 2,000 signatures from film professionals, including \u201cFrankenstein\u201d director Guillermo del Toro, according to organisers.",
    "A similar initiative was organised at the Cannes Film Festival in May.",
    "\u201cThe objective of the letter was to bring Gaza and Palestine to the core of the public conversation in Venice,\u201d Venice4Palestine co-founder and director Fabiomassimo Lozzi told AFP.",
    "\u201cIt was like people in our business were just waiting for someone to raise our voice.\u201d",
    "On the same day just blocks away on the red carpet, \u201cFrankenstein\u201d stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi posed for the paparazzi and signed autographs.",
    "The Netflix-produced film is one of 21 movies in the main competition vying for the festival\u2019s top prize, the Golden Lion.",
    "On the red carpet Friday, Moroccan filmmaker Maryam Touzani held up a sign saying \u201cStop the Genocide in Gaza.\u201d She told AFP it was \u201cessential that we make our voices heard.\u201d",
    "\u201cI want every person to be able to speak out on this. And raise their voice. And make their voice heard,\u201d she said, calling what was going on in Gaza \u201can attack on humanity.\u201d",
    "The festival has said it would not disinvite actors who have supported Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, as the collective had asked it to do for Israeli actor Gal Gadot and Britain\u2019s Gerard Butler -- who regardless were not expected to attend the festival.",
    "\u201cI believe that it\u2019s justified in the same way I believed about 40 years ago that it was justified boycotting artists who performed in South Africa at the height of the apartheid system,\u201d he said.",
    "The controversy over Gaza is not expected to end soon. Next week will see the premiere of \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d, set in Gaza, by Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, in the main competition.",
    "Actors Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix, and directors Alfonso Cuaron and Jonathan Glazer, have joined the movie as executive producers, according to film business news outlet Deadline.",
    "It tells the true story of a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in January 2024 by Israeli forces alongside six family members while trying to flee Gaza City.",
    "Israel invaded Gaza nearly two years ago and has killed at least 63,025 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the UN considers reliable.",
    "The United Nations has declared a famine in the territory caused by Israel\u2019s blockade on the territory of nearly two million people.",
    "The war was sparked by the October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures."
