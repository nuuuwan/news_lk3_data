    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s government approval rating doubled to 21 percent in a June 2023 from 10 percent in February, according to a survey by Verete Research, a Colombo based think tank.",
    "From March 2023, the Sri Lanka rupee was allowed to appreciate by lifting a surrender rule, as the central bank conducted deflationary monetary policy, bringing down food prices in particular.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee collapsed in 2022 from 200 to 360 to the US dollar, after two years of inflationary open market operations to suppress interest rates, effectively re-financing private sector investment and imports (sterilized forex sales).",
    "The central bank purchased large volumes of maturing debt (monetized the GFN) as well as new debt and also injected money overnight into the banking system to drive credit and prevent rates from going up.",
    "Economic confidence also improved from a negative 78 to a still negative 44",
    "In June interest rates were still high. Sri Lanka\u2019s interest rates went up higher than in past currency crises due to fears of a broad-based domestic debt re-structuring. Due to a flaw in the IMF\u2019s default framework, there was no early cut-off date for domestic debt.",
    "Sri Lanka generally has high nominal interest rates and chronic forex shortages and depreciation due to monetary instability coming from the lack of a single anchor regime, analysts have said.",
    "1. Government approval rating | 21% | To the question, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way the current government is working?\u201d 21% said they approve (with an error margin of \u00b1 2.68%). Further, 18% said that they do not have an opinion on the way the current government is working.",
    "2. Sri Lanka satisfaction | 12% | To the question, \u201cIn general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in Sri Lanka?\u201d only 12% said they were satisfied (with an error margin of \u00b1 2.21%). This rating was at 4% in February 2023 and 7% in October 2022.",
    "3. Economic confidence | negative (-) 43.8 | Multiple choice questions on the condition and trajectory of the economy were used to generate an economic confidence score. The score can range from negative (-) 100 to positive (+) 100. A score above zero means more people see the economic conditions positively rather than negatively. If everyone thinks that the economy is in poor condition (instead of good or excellent), and everyone also thinks it is getting worse (rather than better), then the score will be a (-) 100.",
    "In June 2023, 0.8% rated the economic conditions as excellent, 26.6% rated it as good; and 28.8% rated it as getting better. The resulting score was a negative (-) 43.8 (rounded off as negative 44).  This rating was (-) 78 in both February 2023 and October 2022.",
    "The Mood of the Nation survey is designed to assess the approval, satisfaction, and confidence of the nation in relation to the government, the country, and the economy. The poll is based on an island wide nationally representative sample of responses from 1,008 Sri Lankan adults, conducted in June 2023. The poll is conducted as a part of the syndicated survey instrument by Verit\u00e9 Research and the polling partner was Vanguard Survey (Pvt) Ltd."
