    "Parliament, June 06 (Daily Mirror)- The government is trying to sell off the country's power sector to India's Adani group by creating a private sector monopoly over the electricity sector through the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill, National People\u2019s Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath said today.",

    "He said while criticizing the state monopoly in the power sector, the government is now trying to create a private sector monopoly.",
