  "original_title": "IMF Reforms Paying Off? Fitch Keeps Sri Lanka at \u2018CCC+\u2019 Amid Recovery Signs",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); GGlobal credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at \u2018CCC+\u2019, citing continued fiscal and economic vulnerabilities despite notable progress under the country\u2019s IMF-supported reform programme.",
    "Fitch does not assign outlooks to sovereigns rated \u2018CCC+\u2019 or below, but the affirmation reflects a cautiously optimistic view of Sri Lanka\u2019s post-debt restructuring trajectory, following the completion of its sovereign debt overhaul in 2024.",
    "The rating remains constrained by elevated public debt, a high interest-to-revenue ratio, and structural fiscal weaknesses, even as the country demonstrates signs of recovery.",
    "Fitch forecasts gross general government debt to reach 96% of GDP by 2027, well above the \u2018CCC\u2019 median of 74%.",
    "However, the agency acknowledged substantial progress under the 48-month IMF programme, including:",
    "The passage of the 2025 budget aligned with IMF targets, Restoration of cost-recovery pricing for electricity, Reforms in tax compliance, revenue administration, and state-owned enterprises.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s primary fiscal balance has improved significantly, shifting from a 5.7% deficit in 2021 to a 2.2% surplus in 2024, with an average surplus of 2.7% of GDP expected between 2025 and 2027.",
    "Fitch projects the overall fiscal deficit to narrow to 4.2% by 2027.",
    "On the external front, foreign exchange reserves have rebounded to USD 6.2 billion as of mid-2025, up from a low of USD 1.9 billion in 2022.",
    "The external liquidity ratio has nearly doubled to 96.5%, and reserves are expected to rise further to USD 6.4 billion by year-end. The economy is also showing signs of stabilisation, with GDP growth of 5% in 2024 and 4.8% in the first half of 2025, driven by strong performance in industry and services.",
    "Fitch forecasts full-year growth at 4.4%, moderating to 3.6% by 2027.",
    "Inflation is expected to remain low but gradually rise to 5%, in line with the Central Bank\u2019s target.",
    "Despite these gains, Fitch warns that risks remain high, particularly beyond 2027, and that sustained reform momentum is essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and investor confidence."
