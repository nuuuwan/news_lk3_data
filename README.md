Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets as collateral.

Details of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. That’s according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. Here’s how the plan would work:

Most of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.

A French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be “topped up” with European money or other national contributions.

The temple's opening was also criticized for lacking essential facilities like water supply. Despite these issues, fundraising efforts are underway to address the shortcomings. The Hindu community fears this could lead to future disruptions in the pilgrimage route.

### IMF approves Sri Lanka review, calls for monetary policy for stability

*2024-06-13 05:24:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/imf-approves-sri-lanka-review-calls-for-monetary-policy-for-stability-167761/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund has approved Sri Lanka’s program review allowing the disbursement of 330 million US dollars, while calling for monetary policy to be used only for stability.

“Monetary policy should continue prioritizing price stability, supported by a sustained commitment to refrain from monetary financing and safeguard central bank independence,” Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair said in a statement.

The call comes as inflationists are calling for rates cuts to support ‘growth’ and early noises are starting to be made about ‘positive real interest rates’ based on historical inflation.

Sri Lanka’s inflation is currently low as anchor conflicts have not yet re-emerged, though the operating framework of the monetary authority remains deeply flawed without a credible anchor, critics have said.

### Conflict left in Sri Lanka constitution to avoid referendum

ECONOMYNEXT – The 19th Amendment created a conflict in Sri Lanka’s constitution, but it remained unresolved because the then government was determined to avoid a referendum.

The deficiency in the constitution was highlighted in a report by  EconomyNext on Tuesday and later taken up during a government meeting at the highest levels, sources familiar with the issue said.

The constitutional error, which has persisted since April 2015, could allow an incumbent president to extend his term by less than a year without facing a referendum.

Former legislator and President’s Counsel Jayampathy Wickramaratne said the brief from the then government was to come up with a bill for a 19th Amendment which could be passed without a referendum.

“As a member of the team that drafted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, I wish to make a clarification,” Wickramaratne said, adding that they were aware of the issue.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Planters’ Association said a government mandated wage hike which amounted to 70 percent, will be contested in court, as the island’s wages were double that of India.

Tea and rubber estates may have difficulties in servicing loans due to the wage hike.

“The PA emphasizes that wages must be intrinsically linked to productivity to ensure the sustainability of businesses and the livelihoods of workers,” the group said in a statement.

“Sri Lanka already grapples with the highest production costs, wages, and lowest productivity among all tea-growing nations.

“Notably, the newly gazetted wage is double that of India, creating significant cost disparities in the global market.

This unilateral increase affects not only the regional plantation companies but also over 400 private tea factories in Sabaragamuwa and the Southern province, smallholders employing external labor, and all rubber producers and factories, the statement said.

### Competition against the West Indies is decisive to New Zealand

*2024-06-13 01:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185957) · `ta`

In the R20 World Cup, New Zealand's C team faces the West Indies after losing to Afghanistan. A win against the West Indies could secure New Zealand's spot in the Super 8 round, enhancing their chances. Historically, New Zealand has performed well in World Cups, reaching the semi-finals or finals multiple times since 2015 but struggled against Afghanistan this year. The match against the West Indies is crucial for New Zealand, who leads 10-4 in international T20 encounters but faced a tie and loss in previous meetings. Both teams aim to advance to the Super 8 round, making this match pivotal.

🟩

The New Zealand C team, which lost its first match against Afghanistan, will oppose the West Indies in its second match in the R20 World Cup.

The tournament will begin at 6.00 am on Thursday (13).

If the West Indies wins the match, the fourth team will qualify for the Super 8 round, while New Zealand's Super 8 round chance will be questioned.

So in today's match, New Zealand will try to increase its Super round chance by defeating the West Indies.

New Zealand, which has revealed the best in the World Cup since 2015, has advanced to the semi -finals of 2015, 2019, 2019 and 2023 in 2016, 2021 and 2022. On 3 occasions, he played in the final game, but did not hesitate.

However, there is suspicion that New Zealand will leave the first round of Afghanistan by 84 runs this year.

So the rivalry against the West Indies will be a knock out of New Zealand.

On the other hand, the West Indies will also try to win the Super 8 round.

### India qualified for the Super 8 round to win the United States

*2024-06-13 01:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185956) · `ta`

India beat the United States by 7 wickets in the R20 World Cup, qualifying for the Super 8 round. In a challenging pitch, India, after electing to chase 111 runs, achieved the target in 18.2 overs despite early losses. Key contributions came from Suryakumar Yadav (50 runs) and Shivam Dube (31 runs). The United States, batting first, managed 110 runs in 20 overs, led by Nitish Kumar (27) and Steven Taylor (24). India's bowlers, Saurab Nethravalkar and Arshdeep Singh, were standout performers.

🟩

India won by 7 wickets in the R20 World Cup for A Group, which ended some time ago at the New York Nasav County Cricket Stadium between India and the United States.

With this victory, India qualified for the third team in the Super 8 round.

South Africa (D Group) and Australia (B Group) are the first two teams to be selected for the Super 8 round.

In the strange pitch, the players also faced the difficulty of facing the bowlers.

In some cases unthinkable, the ball flowed and in some cases the ball went down.

In response to the United States, India won the toss and elected to win 111 runs, losing 3 wickets in 18.2 overs.

Virat Kohli (0), team captain Rohit Sharma (3) and Rishabh Bant (18) lost 39 runs in the overs.

India's total number was 47 runs for the loss of 3 wickets in 10 overs.

In this case, India had to score 64 in the last 10 overs to achieve the win.

### AKD’s speech on police and rule of law: Merits and demerits

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s (AKD) speech as the Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) at the National Convention organised by the Retired Police Officers Collective on 9 June 2024 is quite promising in terms of establishing or reestablishing rule of law in the country, if they get the opportunity to govern the nation. They have been talking about a ‘system change’ now for some time, and various independent critics and observers were asking the details of this promise, without merely depending on the slogan.

I was fortunate to listen to this speech online and live, through ‘Horawa News,’ and one weakness or wrong that I immediately observed was its leading phrase ‘Malimawa shows its police power.’ I have no idea about who runs the ‘Horawa,’ but that was not what AKD was quite obviously advocating. ‘Power’ is not a good word to use in democracy, worst still is the ‘police power.’

‘Is There Another Way? Debt Restructuring, the IMF and the Future of Sri Lanka’, was the title and topic of the most educative, enlightening public policy event of this year. Organised by Yukthi a newish civic association spearheaded by Ahilan Kadirgamar, Ermiza Tegal and Melanie Gunatilleke, it featured three top-notch international economists, Prof. Jayati Ghosh, Prof. Martin Guzman --former Economics Minister of Argentina-- and Charles Abugre. (https://www.youtube.com/live/3SF2L0nh_l4?si=G7D82fcNI2YSxu5A)

Watching the video, my wife Sanja and I had the same thought: these experts and not Lazard et al, should be our advisors on debt restructuring and consultants on our negotiating team, and our negotiating team should certainly not be the current one.

My key takeaways from what Ghosh, Guzman and Abugre said were:

Each country must do its own expert research rather than blindly accept the IMF narrative.
