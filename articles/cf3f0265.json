  "original_title": "Sri Lanka\u2019s Elephant Crisis: \u201cNo Single solution, but a collective Will\u201d \u2013 Jehan CanagaRetna",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka has lost more than 6,400 elephants in the past 24 years \u2014 an average of over 260 per year \u2014 and 250 more have died in just the first six months of 2025. For Jehan CanagaRetna, Vice President and Head of the Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) Sub-Committee of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), these statistics are a painful reminder of a crisis that has escalated to alarming levels.",
    "\u201cThe numbers keep me awake at night,\u201d he said, speaking to  The Island. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that this wasn\u2019t a problem that would disappear overnight. Human-elephant conflict has been brewing for more than 50 years. Without a systematic, united approach, there won\u2019t be light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s elephant population, estimated at around 6,000, is among the largest remaining populations of Asian elephants in the world. Yet as forests shrink due to agriculture, infrastructure, and human settlements, elephants are increasingly forced into villages and paddy fields in search of food. This conflict has become one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most pressing environmental and social challenges, killing an average of 400 elephants and over 150 people annually.",
    "CanagaRetna, a conservation leader with decades of experience and affiliations with Greenpeace South Asia and the Rainforest Alliance, believes the country has the knowledge to turn the tide \u2014 but lacks the political will.",
    "\u201cThe science is there. Solutions exist. But successive governments have failed to prioritise this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cHEC is not just a wildlife problem. It\u2019s a rural poverty problem, a national security issue, and a matter of cultural heritage. The elephant is part of our identity as Sri Lankans. Losing them would be a tragedy.\u201d",
    "In 2017, Sri Lanka unveiled a comprehensive National Action Plan on HEC, designed by a committee led by world-renowned elephant biologist Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando. The plan recommended science-driven strategies, from landscape-level land use planning to village-centric electric fencing.",
    "Yet, nearly eight years later, the plan has seen little implementation. \u201cThe biggest obstacle is a lack of seriousness at the policymaking level,\u201d CanagaRetna noted. \u201cThe country\u2019s bankruptcy also meant that funding wasn\u2019t available. But the cost of inaction is far greater \u2014 every elephant and human life lost is a national failure.\u201d",
    "He urged the government to empower the Presidential Committee on HEC, chaired by respected conservationist Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, to revive the plan and lead coordinated pilot projects.",
    "One standout strategy is fencing villages instead of forests, a concept tested in two districts by Dr. Fernando. \u201cWe fence the villages and farmland, not the jungle,\u201d CanagaRetna explained. \u201cThat keeps the forests free for elephants to roam their traditional ranges while keeping communities safe. More than 500 farmers are already benefiting from this model.\u201d",
    "Among WNPS\u2019s most promising contributions is the Light Repel System (LRS), a low-cost, community-driven method to keep elephants away from crops. Deployed in 24 sites across six districts, the LRS has achieved an impressive 82% success rate.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re piloting it, collecting data, and preparing a white paper,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce that\u2019s complete, we\u2019ll present it to the government as a proven tool. Scaling it nationwide is possible, but we lack the funding to do it quickly. Right now, every installation depends on community partnerships and donor support.\u201d",
    "Farmers in pilot areas have reported a noticeable drop in night raids by elephants, providing much-needed relief. \u201cThe LRS is simple but effective. For farmers, it\u2019s a lifeline,\u201d CanagaRetna added.",
    "While physical barriers and deterrents are essential, CanagaRetna stresses that solving HEC requires a cultural shift. In Anuradhapura District, WNPS has embedded staff in villages to live alongside farmers, experience their struggles, and co-develop solutions.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t solve this conflict from Colombo. You need to live with these farmers, see the stress they endure daily, and build trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working to change perceptions \u2014 to help communities see elephants as a resource, not an enemy. If they can benefit financially from conservation or ecotourism, hostility will decline.\u201d",
    "This approach is already yielding signs of success. In Ehetuwewa, a farming community that has long been a hotspot for elephant encounters, some villagers are beginning to view elephants differently. \u201cYes, they see elephants as an asset when they\u2019re rewarded for coexisting,\u201d CanagaRetna confirmed.",
    "Initiatives like the Gaja Nena Sahana scholarships, which support children who have lost parents to elephant attacks, are part of this broader strategy. \u201cWe\u2019ve just started awarding scholarships. It\u2019s too soon to measure long-term impact, but these gestures of compassion can shift narratives and heal communities,\u201d he said.",
    "Beyond community work, WNPS continues to invest in cutting-edge research. In partnership with the Department of Wildlife Conservation\u2019s Elephant Transit Home and the University of Ragama, the organisation has conducted a groundbreaking study on antibiotic resistance among wild and captive elephants, including those foraging at garbage dumps.",
    "\u201cThis research is vital. It tells us that human mismanagement of waste isn\u2019t just unsightly; it\u2019s a health risk for elephants and humans alike,\u201d CanagaRetna said.",
    "Another ongoing experiment is a GPS collar-based early warning system. The project aims to alert villagers when elephants approach their settlements, potentially preventing encounters. \u201cWe\u2019ll know by year-end whether this system is scalable. If it works, it could save lives,\u201d he explained.",
    "Calls to reintroduce elephant drives \u2014 a controversial practice where elephants are rounded up and relocated \u2014 are growing louder. CanagaRetna, however, is unequivocal in his opposition.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s scientifically proven that elephant drives don\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cData from collared elephants shows they always return to their home ranges because the areas they\u2019re driven to aren\u2019t suitable. Worse, drives often displace herds of females and calves \u2014 not the lone bulls responsible for crop raiding. It\u2019s a waste of resources and a source of trauma.\u201d",
    "Instead, he advocates for a science-led review of all management practices. \u201cIf drives are unavoidable, at least collar elephants to study the aftermath. But our priority should be proactive, not reactive solutions.\u201d",
    "For CanagaRetna, Sri Lanka\u2019s elephant crisis cannot be solved by a single organisation, project, or technology. It demands a united national effort.",
    "\u201cWe need everyone at the table \u2014 the government, conservationists, farmers, the private sector, and international partners,\u201d he urged. \u201cReducing stress for both farmers and elephants is essential. These communities need immediate relief, and elephants need safe corridors.\u201d",
    "He also believes that empowering rural people economically could be transformative. \u201cIf we can help farmers earn from elephants, whether through tourism or incentives, much of this conflict will disappear. Coexistence isn\u2019t a dream \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s elephants are deeply embedded in its cultural and spiritual fabric. From temple processions to ancient chronicles, these giants are symbols of strength and wisdom. Yet today, they are also symbols of conflict and tragedy.",
    "\u201cThe elephant is a keystone species. If we lose them, our ecosystems and identity suffer irreparably,\u201d CanagaRetna warned. \u201cEvery dead elephant is not just a statistic \u2014 it\u2019s a failure of leadership, a failure of society.\u201d",
    "Until political will and community action align, the grim statistics will continue to climb. For CanagaRetna, that is unacceptable. \u201cA few minutes with the President or Prime Minister wouldn\u2019t be enough,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cBut if I had to say it in one sentence: adopt the action plan.\u201d",
