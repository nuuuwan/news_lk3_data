    "Apr. 5 (Daily Mirror) - The Colombo District Court Judge Sandun Vithana today made an order suspending an enjoining order obtained against the office-bearers of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA).",
    "The order of the Court suspending the enjoining order was made in response to an urgent application filed by motion by the Attorneys-at-Law representing the President and Secretary of the SLSCA.",
    "The Plaintiffs had obtained the order on March 25, 2024 preventing the SLSCA from conducting the demotion and relegation cricket matches scheduled as part of the Under-19 Inter-Schools Division I Two-Day Cricket Tournament, conducted by the Association.",
    "The Defendants had brought to the notice of Court that it is an unincorporated association and that grave and irreparable damage was being caused to the SLSCA, its members, school cricketers, and their education by the actions of the Plaintiffs.",
    "Some of the Plaintiffs had stated that they are cricketers engaged in the said ongoing cricket tournament for the year 2023/24 and representing several schools engaged in the tournament.",
    "Several actions had been filed by some school cricketers from four schools and filed jointly by their Lawyer in the Colombo District Court. Action had been filed stating and seeking relief that it is unjust to demote and relegate four teams by playing relegation matches.",
    "They had stated that the decision taken to relegate four teams by playing one relegation match is causing them prejudice. Thereafter, they had filed action for injunctions and had obtained ex-parte an enjoining order preventing the conducting of the said matches.",
    "However, after hearing submissions by Lawyers for both parties on April 4, 2024, the Colombo District Judge Sandun Vithana delivered the order today suspending the enjoining orders obtained and directing the Defendant party to file objections in the main case.",
    "Senior Counsel Hiran De Alwis with Counsel Pasan Weerasinghe instructed by Darsha Lekamwasam appeared for the incumbent President of the SLSCA Oshara Panditharathne."
