  "original_body_lines": [
    "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was quoted as saying the government should \u201cjust let people die\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than impose a second national lockdown, the inquiry into how Britain handled the crisis heard on Monday.",
    "Patrick Vallance, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser during COVID, made a note in his diary on Oct. 25, 2020, about a meeting involving then Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sunak, who was finance minister.",
    "The diary entry shown to the inquiry recorded how Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser during the pandemic, had relayed to Vallance what he said he had heard at the meeting.",
    "Vallance quoted Cummings in his diary as saying: \u201cRishi thinks just let people die and that\u2019s okay. This all feels like a complete lack of leadership.",
    "A spokesman for Sunak said the prime minister would set out his position when he gives evidence to the inquiry \u201crather than respond to each one in piecemeal\u201d.",
    "The inquiry is examining the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic that shut large sections of the economy and killed more than 220,000 people in Britain. It is due to run until the summer of 2026.",
    "Senior government officials have repeatedly said the government was unprepared for the pandemic and a \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cmacho\u201d culture hampered the response to the health crisis.",
    "The danger for Sunak is that evidence at the inquiry undermines his attempt to cast himself as a change to the chaotic leadership of Johnson even though he was one of the most senior ministers in that government.",
    "Previous evidence has shown he was branded \u201cDr. Death\u201d by one government scientific adviser over his \u201cEat Out to Help out\u201d policy in the summer of 2020, which subsidised meals in pubs and restaurants but was criticised by health experts for spreading the virus."
