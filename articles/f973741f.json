    "The Supreme Court bench comprising justices Yasantha Kodagoda, A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Achala Wengappulli issued formal notice and an interim order suspending the proceedings on the indictment signed by the Director General of Bribery Commission. The Supreme Court also made order that the Bribery Commission reconsiders its position on the indictment signed by the Director General during the interim period.",
