  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Israeli military said it was opening an additional route for 48 hours that Palestinians could use to leave Gaza City as it stepped up efforts on Wednesday to empty the city of civilians and confront thousands of Hamas combatants.",
    "Hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering in the city and many are reluctant to follow Israel\u2019s orders to move south because of dangers along the way, dire conditions, a lack of food in the southern area and fear of permanent displacement.",
    "\u201cEven if we want to leave Gaza City, is there any guarantee we would be able to come back? Will the war ever end? That\u2019s why I prefer to die here, in Sabra, my neighbourhood,\u201d Ahmed, a schoolteacher, said by phone.",
    "At least 63 people were killed by Israeli strikes and gunfire across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, with most of the casualties in Gaza City, local health authorities said.",
    "They said the latest fatalities took the Palestinian death toll from the two-year war between Israel and Hamas past 65,000. Palestinian officials and rescue workers say the true figure is likely higher as many remains are trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.",
    "Among those killed were 13 people, including local TV journalist Mohammad Alaa Al-Sawalhi, who medics said were complying with the order to leave Gaza City.",
    "Another five people were killed and dozens wounded by Israeli gunfire near an aid site in Rafah, local health officials said. The Israeli military said troops had fired warning shots to remove an \u201cimmediate threat.\u201d",
    "The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.",
    "Israel estimates about 400,000 people, or 40% of those who were in Gaza City on August 10 - when it announced plans to take control - have already fled. The Gaza media office says 190,000 have headed south and 350,000 have moved to central and western areas of the city.",
    "A day after Israel announced the launch of its ground offensive to seize control of Gaza\u2019s main urban centre, tanks had moved short distances towards the city\u2019s central and western areas from three directions, but no major advance was reported.",
    "An Israeli official said military operations were focused on getting civilians to head south and that fighting would intensify over the next month or two.",
    "The official said Israel expected around 100,000 civilians to remain in the city, which would take months to capture, and said the operation could be suspended if a ceasefire was reached with the Hamas militant group.",
    "The prospects of a ceasefire appear remote after Israel attacked Hamas political leaders in Doha last week, infuriating Qatar, a co-mediator in ceasefire talks.",
    "Defying global criticism of the attack, including a rebuke by Israel\u2019s stalwart ally, the United States, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would strike Hamas leaders anywhere.",
    "The Hamas-run government\u2019s Ministry of Health said an Israeli drone dropped grenades on one floor of the Rantissi children\u2019s hospital on Wednesday. No casualties were reported but the ministry said some 40 families took their children away.",
    "\u201cThis hospital is the only specialist facility for children with cancer, kidney failure and other life-threatening conditions \u2013 but even these gravely ill children are not spared from relentless bombardment,\u201d said Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director at the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.",
    "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "In leaflets dropped over Gaza City, the military said Palestinians could use the newly reopened Salahudin Road to escape towards the south and that they had until lunchtime on Friday to do so.",
    "But the situation remained chaotic and dangerous for civilians, who have been streaming away on foot, by donkey cart or in vehicles in recent days.",
    "Much of Gaza City was laid waste early in the war in 2023, but around 1 million Palestinians had returned there to homes among the ruins. Forcing them out would mean confining most of Gaza\u2019s population to overcrowded encampments in the south where a hunger crisis is unfolding.",
    "The United Nations, aid groups and foreign governments have condemned Israel\u2019s offensive and the proposed mass displacement.",
    "In a separate response to the Gaza conflict in general, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry concluded on Tuesday that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza. Israel called the assessment \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d.",
    "Israeli forces control Gaza City\u2019s eastern suburbs and have been pounding three areas in the southeast, north and northwestern coastal areas of the city, from which tanks have been pressing towards the centre and western areas.",
    "\u201cGaza is being wiped out. A city that is thousands of years old is being wiped out in front of the whole cowardly world,\u201d said Ahmed, the schoolteacher.",
    "In Nuseirat refugee camp in the enclave\u2019s centre, an airstrike destroyed a high-rise building on Wednesday, prompting residents of nearby buildings to flee in panic.",
    "Palestinian and U.N. officials say no place is safe, including in the southern area designated by Israel as a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d. On Tuesday, an airstrike killed five people in a vehicle as they were leaving Gaza City for the south."
