  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that neither he nor his lawyers were consulted when a businessman on Wednesday filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition in the Supreme Court asking for an interpretation on the tenure of the presidency as per the island nation\u2019s constitution.",
    "Though the FR case is advantageous for President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by another year, he quickly dissociated from the Supreme Court filing, citing that he \u201cis firmly of the opinion that the term of the President is 5 years, and the Election Commission is correct in taking steps to hold the Presidential Election in 2024\u201d.",
    "However, the move has raised some concerns amid uncertainty over the presidential poll. Here are some questions (Q) and answers (A) about the FR petition and what it means in Sri Lanka\u2019s current context:",
    "Q: Who will benefit if the Supreme Court rules a stay order?",
    "A: Obviously President Wickremesinghe. Informal and unreliable surveys show despite his recent gains he is still behind Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka. Wickremesinghe is pushing for highly unpopular IMF-led economic reforms to fast track economic recovery.",
    "Under his ruling, taxes were raised, new taxes were introduced, and cost of living hit a record high. However, he has said such difficulties will have to be borne by the people for a short period until the country sees high economic growth after an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "More time will help him to prove that his reforms are effective. If he can prove this, then his reforms are likely to earn him more votes. One more year of presidency could also help him to prove his rivals\u2019 doom economic theories are rhetoric. It will also change the current momentum which is towards opposition parties, amid strong anti-incumbency sentiment.",
    "A: Interpret the tenure of the presidency, the Election Commission shall hold the next presidential election taking into account that the president\u2019s tenure is six years and for an interim order restraining the members of the Election Commission from taking any further steps in conducting a Presidential Election in 2024 until the Supreme Court determines this Application.",
    "A: If the Supreme Court rules a stay order and allows leave to proceed for the businessman, the Election Commission will not be able to declare the election date after July 17 as scheduled and will have wait until the Supreme Court verdict on the case.",
    "If the case is dismissed, the Election Commission can go ahead as it has already decided. Legal experts say the petitioner has interestingly neither pleaded nor stated infringement of any specific fundamental rights which will be the basis for relief. They also say the petitioner has not sought any declaratory relief or finding (with or without compensation) to any fundamental rights infringement(s), while seeking effective post-enactment review of 19th Amendment to the constitution which reduced the tenure of the president to five years from six.",
    "A: After the unprecedented economic crisis, mass protests led to the ousting of former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 9. His administration\u2019s wrong economic policies were seen as the immediate reason for the economic crisis. So people were frustrated and angry about the Rajapaksa regime\u2019s actions. They wanted to change the government and punish the Rajapaksas for their alleged economic crimes despite the fact that the majority had chosen Rajapaksa through democratic elections.",
    "The Rajapaksas backed Wickremesinghe for the presidency in the parliament as per the constitution. After becoming the president, Wickremesinghe was seen as a leader suppressing freedom of expression after he resisted any protests in the capital Colombo, and safeguarding the Rajapaksas despite past corrupt deals. His government also postponed local government polls which were scheduled to be held in March 2023. High taxes and cost of living also have led to more frustration. So, people have been waiting for an election to express their frustration. (Colombo/July 4/2024)"
