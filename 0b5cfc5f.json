    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo Mayoral Candidate Mujibur Rahman yesterday filed a Right to Information request with the Presidential Secretariat to obtain information on state-sponsored benefits accorded to former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "\u201cWe are all aware that Gotabaya Rajapaksa stepped down from his post prior to the end of his term. But the current Government is now maintaining a person who left his post. They are spending a significant amount of people\u2019s tax monies to maintain him,\u201d he said.",
    "Rahman said the Government is spending a significant sum on Rajapaksa\u2019s official residence, vehicles, security and other necessities.",
    "He said the RTI was filed to elicit information from the Government on the tax monies being spent on an ex-President who stepped down from the post.",
    "Rahman said once he receives the information he will file a case before the Supreme Court.\u00a0 \u201cHe should not be maintained with the public money. It is yet another stress and pressure on them.\u201d he maintained.",
    "According to him, their intention is to protect the people\u2019s tax monies and interests through this move."
