    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says he is confident that Sri Lanka will be able to shed its bankruptcy status by September and urged everyone to work collectively to back the government\u2019s efforts.",
    "He made these remarks while addressing the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID) held at the Cinnamon Grand on Friday (June 30).",
    "\u201cI hope by September that Sri Lanka will be able to shed its bankruptcy status. Whether you are Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim or any other nationality, no one likes to be called bankrupt. If individually you don\u2019t like it, then collectively why do you want to have this tag on you? So let\u2019s get out of it.\u201d",
    "The President also mentioned that a Climate Prosperity Plan was launched in November, which means that more resources are required, partially from the Government and partly from other investments, including private investments. As a result, the President stated that if Sri Lanka abandons the program, the country would immediately forfeit the $700 million that the World Bank is set to provide the country, and the second review would be a failure.",
    "Sri Lanka in future will start playing a more active role in the area of debt and climate resilience and the President expressed confidence that Sri Lanka can make it with what it has got.",
    "The President further said that Sri Lanka has a growth agenda which the Government has placed up for discussion with everyone involved. However, he said that completing the debt restructuring is critical.",
    "Wickremesinghe noted that he had already met with members of the Cabinet, Bankers, Chamber of Commerce representatives, and trade union representatives and held discussions.",
    "The President also expressed confidence about Sri Lanka getting out of the present crisis, while looking ahead for a far more competitive economy.",
    "He noted that Sri Lanka would be making an application in the next month to join the RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that puts Sri Lanka into the whole Southeast East Asian market. As a start off in building a competitive economy, discussion will commence with the EU and India to strengthen trade agreements, the President added."
