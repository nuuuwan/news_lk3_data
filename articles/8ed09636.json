    "Trump\u2019s proposed cabinet appointments short on quality, long on slavish loyalty",
    "Last week, in the despair I felt in the aftermath of the election to the US presidency of the most evil man in the United States, I wrote that I will take a break to lick my wounds and get over my distress at the apparent catastrophe that has befallen my second home. Then I realized that this is not the end of the world, though it sure felt like it on the morning after the election.",
    "I learned that I was not alone in these feelings of despair. Trump\u2019s win had sparked off an unprecedented increase in Google searches reflecting a growing interest among Americans in relocating to foreign countries, New Zealand heading the list with an astonishing 7,600% increase! The next most popular Google search was \u201cthe least painful way to kill yourself\u201d.",
    "I have since regained my perspective, and will continue to take the liberty of inflicting my regular brand of \u201cmisinformation\u201d. To paraphrase the words of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it will hopefully keep bending towards justice. Admittedly, the election of Donald Trump has served to lengthen the arc of the universe way beyond our lifetimes, perhaps even break away from the traditional definition of justice.",
    "Many great countries in the world, Russia, China, North Korea, to name a few, have been following alternative, totalitarian ideologies of governance in the post-World War II era. However, the United States has always been the leader, the beacon of democracy, the example for the \u201cFree World\u201d and many developing countries to pursue the concepts of freedom, the rule of law and the government of the people, by the people, for the people. The justice at the end of the moral arc of the universe.",
    "The constitution of the United States of America in 1789 is recognized as the harbinger of this Great Experiment of Democracy at a time when the world was largely ruled by monarchies and other feudal and totalitarian systems of government.",
    "The overwhelming success of Trump\u2019s Republican Party marked yet another, perhaps terminal phase, in the continuing saga of the Great Experiment of Democracy. Some dregs of the evil breed of white supremacy and ethnic purity seem to have survived the defeat of Hitler and the Nazis in Germany in the 1940s. The ultra-right wing of European nationalists has emerged once again to fight for their Christian God-given rights of white dominance. And they seem to be gaining ground, in the USA and many European nations.",
    "In a twisted, long-term kind of way, it may have actually been a blessing that Trump won the 2024 election. He would have never conceded a loss, and a corrupt Supreme Court would have ruled in favor of Trump on any election disputes. The nation would have been embroiled in endless constitutional crises combined with violence, incited by Trump, probably ending in a second civil war.",
    "After almost every election, pundits predict that the nation will be changed forever, for better or for worse. Just this century alone, after the election of African-American Barack Obama to the White House, Jon Stewart, the smartest political satirist in the US, then and now, concluded his Late Show after the 2008 presidential election with the words, \u201cAt last, we are who we say we are\u201d. Meaning that the nation was well on the way to exterminating the plague of racism and white supremacy that had bedeviled it for centuries.",
    "A mere eight years later, in 2016, these predictions were proved spectacularly wrong when Donald Trump, a white supremacist with a cruel history of well-publicized racist behavior, ties to the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi movements, was elected to the presidency. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the most qualified candidate ever to run for the US presidency, proving that racism and misogyny were both very much alive in the United States.",
    "Trump\u2019s first actions on assuming the office of the presidency in January 2017 was to enact a $1.7 trillion tax cut benefiting mainly the super-wealthy and the corporations; to withdraw from the United Nations sponsored Paris Climate Change Agreement; and to remove all regulations against pollution imposed by President Obama to protect the environment against corporate pollution.",
    "When Covid 19 hit in his last year of office, Trump was exposed as the quintessential narcissistic windbag he is, who, by his criminal incompetence, was responsible for the avoidable deaths of nearly a million Americans and the near-destruction of the economy.",
    "As a result, Americans came to their senses \u2013 briefly \u2013 and dumped Trump ignominiously, electing Democratic President Biden by a landslide in 2020, both on the popular and Electoral College votes. Trump refused to concede the election and was found guilty of inciting a violent insurrection to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, stealing top-secret documents on leaving the White House, and numerous other felonies.",
    "MSNBC Political Anchor, Lawrence O\u2019Donnell said that Trump would never again set foot in the Capitol, and public opinion was that the only government facility Trump would occupy in the future would be a federal prison cell, clad in an orange jumpsuit perfectly matching his skincolor.",
    "But here we are, just four short years later, Trump is elected back to the White House with a comprehensive mandate by the same \u201cWe the people\u201d. The United States will adopt an isolationist policy of White America First, with the US constitution of 1789 replaced by a combination of the conservative Heritage Foundation created document Project 2025 \u2013 Mandate for Leadership and Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, which more accurately reflect the current aspirations of the MAGA movement of white supremacy and a Christian Nationalist kleptocracy.",
    "It took the nation nearly two centuries to evolve from a slave owning feudal state governed by white men to an inclusive, though imperfect democracy, with equal legal rights for all its citizens.",
    "And it took America under two decades to change from a constitutional Socialist Democracy run by the most ethical, competent African-American President to a crooked kleptocracy run by a white supremacist, fascist convicted felon.",
    "Has the Great Experiment failed? Is the change to a white supremacist, Christian nationalist authoritarian system of governance here to stay, with the election of Donald Trump? Will the new nation betray her traditional allies and join her erstwhile adversaries like Russia, China, North Korea and the growing number of ultra-radical right-wing nations?",
    "Trump\u2019s proposed appointments to his senior posts so far, cabinet and non-cabinet, give an indication as to where his domestic, foreign and fiscal policies are heading. Trump has made it clear that he will rule as a dictator, not for a day as he promised during his election campaign, but a dictator in perpetuity.",
    "Trump\u2019s appointment of his long-time confidante and architect of his winning election campaign, Susie Wiles, 67, as the first female White House Chief of staff was seen to be a sound choice. Also known as the \u201cIce Maiden\u201d, she avoids the limelight and speaks sparingly in public. Her stated intention is to limit access of the \u201cclown car to the White House\u201d, away from the Clown-in-Chief.",
    "Trump has appointed Florida Senator Marco Rubio, 53, one-time political opponent but now one of his closest advisers, to the coveted position of Secretary of State. Rubio has considerable experience serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and is considered to be one of Trump\u2019s more rational appointments, so his days are numbered.",
    "Trump has appointed Congressman Matt Gaetz, 42, as Attorney General, which is not just a dangerous joke. Gaetz\u2019 only qualification is his slavish loyalty to Trump. He is currently under a congressional ethics probe for having sex with, and trafficking, underage girls and the illegal use of drugs. His nomination to the post of Attorney General is so scandalous that his appointment would probably not have been approved, even by the Republican majority Senate.",
    "Trump has foreseen the possibility of some of his more controversial, even dangerous appointments, like that of Matt Gaetz may not get Senate approval. Some would not even pass the mandatory background checks. He has declared his intention to circumvent the Senate approval process for his nominations for cabinet and senior posts by using the Recess Appointments clause in the constitution. By abusing a clause that was supposed to be availed of only in emergency situations, Trump has established that Senate approval, even that of a Republican majority Senate, will not be required for his appointments. The most invidious appointment of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, or any other such appointment, is now within the sole power of the president, as and when required.",
    "As the head of the Department of Justice, all of Trump\u2019s felonies will vanish into thin air the moment Gaetz assumes office. And Trump\u2019s threats of appointing special prosecutors to investigate the \u201ccrimes\u201d of his political opponents will start the day after his inauguration.",
    "Trump\u2019s choice for Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, 44, a former Fox weekend political commentator has enjoyed a close relationship with the President-elect over the years. He served as an infantry officer in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has no governmental experience whatsoever, but he did play the lead role in a soap commercial on Fox TV, which must count for something in an administration headed by a Bible salesman.",
    "Hegseth is a strong anti-Islamist and climate denier. He agrees with Trump\u2019s intention to court-martial by military tribunal \u201cwoke\u201d Generals, like John Kelly and Mark Millie, who have recently made critical comments about Trump\u2019s fascist tendencies. Hegseth also believes that women should play no role in combat warfare, which will take US military policies back to the misogynistic dark ages.",
    "Robert F. Kennedy Jr, 70, has been picked as the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, a convicted felon for drug possession in 1984, is a scion of the famous Kennedy dynasty, the son of Bobby Kennedy and nephew of JFK and Teddy Kennedy. He has been disowned by the clan for his erratic behavior in a colorful past.",
    "He believes, against all scientific evidence, in many outlandish conspiracy health theories, the most controversial of which are that vaccinations lead to autism and chemicals like fluoride in water make people gay. Trump intends to \u201clet Bobby go wild on health, vaccines, medicines\u201d, a matter of grave concern to the American people, who are fearful of their children contracting infectious diseases like polio, smallpox, measles and the like, which have been virtually eliminated by the efficacy of vaccinations.",
    "Tulsi Gabbard, 43, is Trump\u2019s pick for Director of National Intelligence, basically the spy chief of the nation. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, was a candidate for the presidency in 2019. She has since become an ardent Trump MAGA devotee. She is alleged to have cozy relations with the Kremlin, spreading Russian propaganda about the legality of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. As such, she is the perfect cover for Trump\u2019s liaison with Putin. When questioned if she had ties with the Kremlin, Gabbard bristled with anger and snapped: Koneshna nyet! (Certainly not!).",
    "The appointment of Stephen Miller, 39, to the post of Deputy Chief of Staff is in keeping with Trump\u2019s avowed fascist, \u201cimmigrants are vermin who poison the blood of our people\u201d policies. Miller recently made a Hitler-like rant at the recent Madison Square Garden rally that \u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only. Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown. While Miller didn\u2019t specify who exactly the \u201cAmericans\u201d were, it was obvious that he was dreaming of the descendants of white, Christian Europeans, ideally with blonde hair and blue eyes.",
    "Governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem, 53, has been chosen to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and will oversee critical functions including border security, the Secret Service and keeping the nation safe from naughty puppies. (Noem wrote in her new book, \u201cNo Going Back\u201d that she had shot her darling little puppy, Cricket, \u201cto teach her a lesson\u201d).",
    "Elon Musk, 53, and Vivek Ramaswamy, 39, have been selected to head a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, (DOGE) to maintain a sweeping oversight on government spending.",
    "Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, was Trump\u2019s greatest donor in his election campaign. He is a major government contractor and a beneficiary of federal spending. Ramaswamy, briefly a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, vowed during his election campaign to cut 50% -75% of federal appointments to be replaced by loyal political appointees.",
    "Both favor the kind of \u201cpurge\u201d of federal career employees who will be replaced with a bureaucracy loyal to the ruling party, a feature common in Banana Republics and authoritarian countries like Russia, China and North Korea, the leaders of which are greatly admired by Trump.",
    "Going by Trump\u2019s first term, when his senior appointments formed a part of a revolving door, these appointments too should be deemed temporary assignments to be served entirely at the pleasure of the beloved leader.",
    "Except for Elon Musk, who, with his billionaire friends, own Trump. Musk has ingratiated himself with Trump, taken up residence at Mar a Lago and is already behaving as if he is the co-president. A clash of colossal egos seems to be deliciously on the menu.",
    "D-Day invasion of Normandy \u2013 a day for peace, a never-ending dawn",
