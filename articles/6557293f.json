    "Says experienced and capable leaders are expressing their interest to join SJB",
    "Confirms implementing comprehensive framework, strategic plan and implementation policies to eradicate corruption",
    "Ensures to bring all past wrongdoers to justice under SJB Govt.",
    "Says a talented professional team of SJB to formulate policies and guidelines to address existing burning issues",
    "Commends SJB leader Premadasa for taking initiatives as opposition leader to implement people-centric programs",
    "Says SJB\u2019s ex-servicemen movement represents disciplined, experienced, mature, and deeply patriotic segment of population",
    "Claims many of the most respected ex-servicemen, with proven track records and recognised service, are with the SJB\u2019s Ranawiru movement",
    "Says SJB intends to fully utilise ex-servicemen in nation building through establishing an Ex-Servicemen\u2019s Secretariat",
    "Claims military officers appointed to top posts under previous Gotabaya Rajapaksa Govt. performed well",
    "Former Army Chief General Daya Ratnayake claimed that countries were vulnerable to many threats when national security was compromised, especially when economic, social, political, legal, international relations, educational, environmental, and cultural issues, each of which is a critical component of national security, were ignored and not addressed well. \u201cWe saw with the collapse of a democratically elected Government and the forced departure of the former executive president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, two years ago. A similar situation is currently unfolding in Bangladesh, leading to significant human and asset losses,\u201d he said, adding that under a Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Government addressing those burning issues will be given top priority to maintain national security. General Ratnayake, who was the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army from 2013 to 2015, was the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and also the Secretary to the Ministry of Industries during the previous Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government.",
    "He said the SJB leader Sajith Premadasa was fully aware that national security depends on the stability of those components important for national security and had already developed comprehensive policies and guidelines to have a robust national security framework.",
    "He, who believes that SJB leader Sajith Premadasa has a vision and capability to steer the country in the right direction, said that he was compelled to stand with a team that had the strength to guide the country and its people out of the existing crisis situation.",
    "\u201cWitnessing the present plight of our country, I felt a strong sense of duty today, much like when we once united to save the nation from ruthless terrorists,\u201d General Ratnayake said in an interview with the Daily FT.",
    "When asked about SJB\u2019s plans to strengthen relationships with the US, India and China, General Ratnayake said SJB leader Premadasa was well aware of geopolitical realities and under an SJB government defence relations with India, China, and the US would be strengthened to uphold Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty while contributing to regional peace and stability.",
    "Q: You were aligned to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and why did you join the SJB?",
    "A: Many have asked this question. Let me explain why I took this move. My late parents instilled in us values and also throughout my education at my alma mater Maliyadeva College in Kurunegala helped me to absorb values in life through the religious teachings and then during my career in the military, it has also instilled in me the principle of placing the country before self.",
    "Witnessing the present plight of our country, I felt a strong sense of duty, much like when we once united to save the nation from ruthless terrorists. This time, too, I am compelled to stand with a team that has the strength to guide our country and its people out of the existing crisis situation.",
    "Q: But, do you believe that the SJB leader Sajith Premadasa has a vision for the country\u2019s future?",
    "A: While facing many challenges, especially from his former party leadership, after he announced the forming of the SJB, look at how he has brought the SJB to its present stand. It was not a rosy path for him and he walked through many obstacles, mud-slinging and challenges. It\u2019s important to note that he is not doing this alone. He has gathered a talented professional team with equal representation, leading them in a steady, upward march.",
    "For the first time in our political history, his initiatives as the opposition leader have delivered tangible benefits to the people. One fine example is the \u2018Suhuru Panthiya project\u2019 which focuses on investing in our future generations through technology-backed education. This demonstrates not only his vision but also his capability to lead the country in the right direction.",
    "Q: It\u2019s alleged that corruption prevails in every sector of the administrative structure of the Government. Do you think that under an SJB Government, corruption can be dealt with?",
    "A: Corruption is a critical issue that the people of our country are vigilant about. As a party, we have made it our top priority to develop a comprehensive framework, strategic plan, and implementation policies, supported by unified institutions, and an upgraded legal system to eradicate corruption from Sri Lanka.",
    "Consider the efforts made during parliamentary debates, where the SJB leader and our team consistently take the lead in exposing corruption, such as the VSF issue. This demonstrates our commitment to tackling corruption head-on.",
    "I am confident that under an SJB Government, we will use all our resources to eradicate corruption and bring all past wrongdoers to justice.",
    "Q: There are several ex-servicemen\u2019s organisations affiliated with different political parties. What is the difference between them and the SJB\u2019s \u2018Dividena Ranawiru\u2019 movement?",
    "A: I respect the choices of ex-servicemen in aligning with their preferred political parties. However, it is worth noting that many of the most respected ex-servicemen, with proven track records and recognised service, are with the SJB\u2019s Ranawiru movement.",
    "The SJB as a party has always recognised the dedication, commitment, and sacrifices made by our armed forces over the past 76 years. No other organisation has shown such an unwavering commitment to maintain the unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national security of our country, as well as protecting democracy.",
    "Additionally, we understand the importance of the large number of ex-servicemen who have retired but are still relatively young. This group represents a disciplined, experienced, mature, and deeply patriotic segment of our population. As a country, we have not yet fully utilised this valuable human resource to its fullest potential for nation building efforts.",
    "The SJB is actively developing the necessary concepts and strategies to address this. Given the large number of ex-service personnel, we are proposing to establish an Ex-Servicemen\u2019s Secretariat. This will be a permanent structure with power, resources, and funding to address the needs of service personnel and to use their skills and experience in ways that benefit the country.",
    "SJB\u2019s Dividena Ranawiru movement has already seen significant growth, with many ex-servicemen and women from other camps joining us. These individuals are committed to strengthening the party in its mission to achieve social and economic development for the country.",
    "Q: As the former Army Chief, how do you view the country\u2019s national security, and what priority will it be given if the SJB comes to power?",
    "A: National security is a broad and multifaceted concept. Recent history has shown us how vulnerable we can be when national security is compromised, as we saw with the collapse of a democratically elected government and the forced departure of the Executive President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. A similar situation is currently unfolding in Bangladesh leading to significant human and asset losses causing a severe blow to democracy.",
    "These issues arise from unaddressed economic, social, political, legal, international relations, educational, environmental, and cultural challenges\u2014each of which is a critical component of national security.",
    "The SJB leadership is fully aware that national security depends on the stability of these areas. As such, our leadership and strategic element have prioritised developing comprehensive policies and guidelines to address these aspects and ensure a robust national security framework.",
    "Q: The JVP claims to have a strong backing from ex-servicemen. How do you respond to this?",
    "A: The meaning of strong is a relative term. Even if support grows from zero to two or three percent, it may appear significant, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it strong. The reality is that while a few hundred ex-servicemen might support the JVP across the country, it\u2019s often the same group being showcased in different locations.",
    "What they haven\u2019t grasped is that we are now living in an era of advanced information technology, where artificial intelligence plays a significant role. The true strength does not need to be claimed but it becomes evident through meaningful contributions to society.",
    "Q: The former Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government was accused of appointing too many military personnel to top positions in State institutions. How do you respond to this, and why do you think they failed?",
    "A: It\u2019s unfair to simply state that appointing military officers led to its failure. If you look closely, despite the perception, only a relatively small number of officers were appointed, and some of them performed exceptionally well. The real issue lies in the country\u2019s economic downturn, total bankruptcy, and the severe pandemic situation, which overwhelmed the entire nation, including the former President Rajapaksa. In such circumstances, it is unrealistic to expect a few organisations to succeed on their own.",
    "The failures in Government institutions aren\u2019t solely due to leadership issues. Many factors contribute to these challenges. The good news is that the SJB leadership and strategic think-tank is already working on identifying these issues within the Government and public sector. We are developing remedial measures to address these longstanding problems and are committed to introducing the necessary legislation to rectify them.",
    "Q: How do you see Sri Lanka\u2019s defence relations with the US, China, and India under an SJB Government?",
    "A: Sri Lanka\u2019s defence relations with the US, China, and India are of paramount import and must be managed with a careful balance that respects our sovereignty and national interests. India, as our closest neighbour, has always maintained a special relationship with us, particularly in the defence sector. Their ongoing support in training our armed forces and their interest in regional stability make this relationship crucial. We will continue to nurture and strengthen these ties, acknowledging India\u2019s role as a key partner in our national security.",
    "China, too, has been a steadfast ally, especially during our past struggles with separatism. Their continued support in the form of training and military assistance is deeply valued. When the SJB comes into power, we will work to maintain this strategic partnership, recognising the mutual benefits it brings to both nations.",
    "The United States, as a global superpower, has always been a significant player in international defence cooperation. Our relationship with the US is built on mutual respect and shared interests in regional security.",
    "Under an SJB Government, surely we will aim to enhance our defence ties with the US through cooperation, training, and exchanges, while ensuring that our engagements are aligned with Sri Lanka\u2019s broader national interests.",
    "I am confident since our leader is well aware of these geopolitical realities. The SJB Government will seek to strengthen these defence relationships with India, China, and the US in a way that upholds Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty and contributes to regional peace and stability.",
    "Q: How confident are you that the SJB can come into power while there are speculations that some of the heavyweights of the SJB, who were former UNPers, are planning to join President Wickremesinghe soon?",
    "A: Speculation and rumours are common in the political arena, especially when an election is around the corner. However, these are often tactics used to create doubt and confusion among the public. The reality on the ground tells a different story. The SJB has been steadily gaining momentum and support from across the country, and this is a testament to the growing trust people have in our leadership and party\u2019s vision for the future.",
    "It\u2019s important to note that many of these so-called speculations are unfounded and are being spread to undermine our progress. In truth, more individuals, including experienced and capable leaders, are expressing their interest in joining the SJB. They recognise the strength of our platform and our commitment to leading the country towards a more prosperous, harmonious and stable future.",
    "We are confident in the SJB\u2019s ability to come to power because we are focused on addressing the real issues facing the country. Our policies are rooted in the needs of the people, and we are working tirelessly to earn their trust and support. Our strength lies in our unity and shared vision, and with our able leader we are determined to lead Sri Lanka into a new era of development and progress.",
    "Q: It has been said that you joined the SJB with some promises. Is this true?",
    "A: My guiding principle has always been the country first before self. Throughout my career, both in the armed services and beyond, I have never sought personal gains or made demands. My focus has always been on serving the nation and ensuring the well-being of its people.",
    "I decided to join the SJB not because of any promises or personal incentives. My decision was driven by a genuine belief that SJB leader Premadasa has the vision and capability to lead Sri Lanka towards a better future. My colleagues, both from my time in the armed services and those I have worked with since, know that I am committed to this cause without any ulterior motives.",
    "My priority is to contribute to the betterment of our country, and I believe that under SJB leader Premadasa\u2019s leadership, we can achieve the expected progress and stability that Sri Lanka desperately needs and many people are waiting to achieve.",
    "My involvement with the SJB is purely to support this vision and to help to build a stronger and prosperous nation for Sri Lankans, who are living in the four corners of the country."
