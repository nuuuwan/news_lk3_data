### Production of 6 lakhs of chicken eggs per month

*2024-03-28 13:56:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179898) · `ta`

The country produces 6 lakh chicken eggs monthly, with prices expected to remain stable until December. Despite a 2022 downturn, recovery is underway, with egg production increasing to 6 lakh per month. The price of eggs could drop to 30 rupees, potentially harming the industry. The government has been asked to investigate egg exports. Poultry fodder prices have fallen to 180 rupees, benefiting farmers. If egg prices drop to 35 rupees, small and medium manufacturers may struggle. More chickens are being imported, leading to an increase in eggs and chicks by early 2025.

🟩

6 lakh chicken eggs are being produced per month in the country. The price of eggs will not be increased till December, said Ratnasree Alagoon, Secretary of the All Ceylon Egg Manufacturers Association.

Despite the fall in 2022, the country is now recovering from the late 2023 and the increase in egg production to 6 lakhs per month.

In fact, the price of eggs can be reduced to 30 rupees. This can cause a massive decline in our industry.

"We have requested the government to investigate the export of eggs to the lunch plan and export the eggs."

Meanwhile, the price of poultry fodder has fallen to 180 rupees, said RM Sarath Ratnayake, president of the All Ceylon Egg Manufacturers Association.

The price of a kilo of poultry, which was sold for 240 rupees in 2022, has now fallen to 180 rupees. Therefore, if the farmers get 40 rupees, we can continue this business.

Small and medium egg manufacturers face severe difficulties if the price of eggs falls to Rs 35.
