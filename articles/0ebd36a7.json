  "original_title": "Sri Lanka\u2019s NPP notes five-point crisis for economic growth sans details",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has identified five crises that need resolving for Sri Lanka\u2019s economy to progress, much of which emphasise a production economy targeting export growth though sparse on the detail on resource allocation.",
    "NPP spokesman and former parliamentarian Sunil Handunneththi speaking at an event in Mulaitivu on Thursday June 13 said Sri Lanka is grappling with firstly, a collapse of the production economy, second, a budget deficit, third, a balance of payment crisis which has, fourthly, created a debt crisis, and finally, a resultant gap between haves and have-nots.",
    "\u201cWe must first understand the crisis. We reocgnise five main crises that have the same impact irrespective of differences between the north and south.",
    "\u201cThe first is the collapse of the production economy. We can see this historically. Agriculture that used to be some 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) has now fallen to 8 percent. Essential food is imported. We cannot produce the rice needed for the small population here. Things that can be made here are also imported.",
    "\u201cSecond is the income crisis. For the people, their expenses are twice their income. The budget deficit is two or three-fold every day. Banks cannot give loans to businesses and industries because the government takes funds to address the budget deficit. The government takes most of the people\u2019s savings for this,\u201d he said.",
    "The balance of payment crisis Sri Lanka is facing the third crisis, according to Handunneththi, which has triggered a debt crisis, in turn leading to a crisis of income disparity among the people.",
    "\u201cThird is the balance of payments crisis. Imports are two or three fold export income. The government has to take 11 to 12 billion US dollars in loans from foreign countries. When GDP is 80 billion US dollars, debt has gone over 100.\u201d",
    "\u201cAll this creates a massive gap between haves and have-nots. Without finding solutions to these crisis, there is no point distributing goods,\u201d he said.",
    "Handunnethi\u2019s remarks appear to be departure from the NPP\u2019s anti-corruption rhetoric which had centred its economic development policy agenda primarily on fighting corruption.",
    "\u2018Fighting corruption\u2019 and \u2018recovering stolen assets\u2019 have been popular slogans since the Aragalaya protests in Sri Lanka and the NPP has made it its central theme in its bid for power. The leftist outfit had also adopted a position that\u2019s cautiously critical of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the reforms the international lender has prescribed for Sri Lanka in exchange for a 2.9 billion-dollar bailout.",
    "However, NPP leadership had recently acknowledged the need to continue the IMF programme since the agreement has already been signed.",
    "The Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which controls the NPP, though it was never in government barring a brief stint in an Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)-led coalition in the early 2000s, has been instrumental in driving popular support against privatisation.",
    "Three key policy pillars articulated by the JVP from 2001-2004 and embraced by mainstream politician Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s administration in 2005 onward have been highlighted by experts.",
    "From 2005, Sri Lanka halted privatisation, started recruiting tens of thousands of unemployed graduates into the public service every year with lifetime pensions, expanding an already bloated public sector and denying any benefit of a peace dividend to the country.",
    "Sri Lanka also abandoned a price formula for fuel that had helped keep the rupee stable and inflation low from 2001 to 2003 even as global commodity prices went up from the \u2018mother of all liquidity bubbles\u2019 fired by the Federal Reserve from 2001.",
    "From 2001 to 2003, state workers fell from 1.164 million to 1.043 million. By 2020, the public sector cadre has grown to 1.58 million with another batch of 53,000 unemployed graduates being paid tax money. (Colombo/Jun14/2024)"
