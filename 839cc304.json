    "COLOMBO (News 1st); In a move to enhance security within the prison system, Sri Lanka's Department of Prisons has begun installing CCTV cameras in buses transporting \"special category\" prisoners.",
    "The initiative aims to improve the security measures that are adopted during the transfer of prisoners, said Gamini B. Dissanayake, Prisons Commissioner and Spokesperson.",
    "\"These cameras will not only strengthen security arrangements but also allow us to closely monitor the activities of both inmates and prison personnel during transportation,\" stated Dissanayake.",
    "He highlighted the potential to address concerns about contraband entering prisons, citing specific instances of \"drugs being thrown from outside the buses.\"",
    "The installation process targets buses transporting \"special category\" prisoners, presumably a designation for high-risk or vulnerable individuals requiring heightened security measures.",
    "The camera installations coincide with ongoing efforts to manage Sri Lanka's prison population, currently standing at close to 28,000 individuals.",
    "Notably, Dissanayake acknowledged the presence of approximately 14,500 drug addicts within the prison system, underscoring the need for effective rehabilitation and reintegration programs.",
