    "The incident, which occurred early today, tragically resulted in the death of two wild elephants and left another seriously injured. The train, en route to Batticaloa, was transporting fuel when it struck the elephants, causing the derailment.",
    "Deputy General Manager (Traffic) of the Railway Department, N. J. Indipolage, stated that the train cannot be re-railed until the remaining fuel is safely removed from the affected tanks. Once this is completed, work to restore the train to the tracks will commence.",
    "Meanwhile, an investigation has been launched to determine if the train was traveling at a speed above the regulated 20 km per hour, as indicated by warning signs in the area. Authorities are assessing whether the driver adhered to the speed limits, which are meant to protect wildlife in regions known for elephant crossings.",
