    "The All Ceylon Traditional Coconut Oil Manufacturers Association alleged that the latest import tax on coconut oil imports would lead to a fraud similar to the infamous multi-billion \u2018sugar tax scam\u2019 benefiting only a handful of importers with stocks purchased previously.",
    "The Association\u2019s Convener Buddhika de Silva told Daily Mirror the price hike resulting from the tax hike would ensure benefits for a few importers who were involved in trade malpractices in the past.",
    "He said he was aware of some importers maintaining stocks of around 50,000 tonnes of imported coconut oil.",
    "\u201cThis will not ensure benefits for consumers or local manufacturers,\u201d he said.",
    "He said there was a tax of Rs. 200 previously on coconut oil imports, and urged the government to re-impose it. Also, he asked for the implementation of the Cabinet decision taken in 2020 to import dehydrated coconut chips as raw materials for the traditional coconut oil industry.",
    "\u201cWe need to import raw material. Our association is ready to import instead of BCC. We will find our own funds.All we need is the government\u2019s tax concession offered to BCC to be offered to traditional coconut oil manufacturers,\u201d he said. (Kelum Bandara)"
