1800 ஆம் ஆண்டளவில் இருந்து காலநிலை மாற்றங்களுக்கு பிரதானமான பங்களிப்பினை செய்கின்ற காரணியாக மானிட செயற்பாடுகளே அமைந்துள்ளன. மானிட செயற்பாடுகளிலான பசுமைக்குடில் வாயுக்களின் உமிழ்வு இடையறாமல் உயர்வடைந்து தற்போது மானிட வரலாற்றின் உச்ச மட்டத்தை அடைந்துள்ளது.

But then Rishad Badiudeen and Rauf Hakim were the ministers who were ministers, and the Moulavi editor of the Moulavi Editor to the Editor. Since then, the Ulama Party has been in the process.

If a person who has been held at the GCE high -rise, the teacher's appointment is available for three years at Kalvikkaluri.

But if a Moulavi is available for a Moulavi, it is the great injustice it is to Moulavi to pass the Moulavi and end the GCE high -level and to pass the Al -Alim exam.

"Two former MPs agreed to recommend liquor store licenses without contesting recent elections. 361 licenses issued, sparking political bribery allegations. High Court case pending on district liquor store limits."

🟩

Two of our MPs agreed that they were allowed to set up liquor stores. Jaffna has not contested the election. Former parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran said.

He said this while participating in a press conference held at the Jaffna Vadamarachchi Media House in VM Road in Point Pedro on Thursday (19).

Each district has a definition of liquor schools permits.. But they did not contest the election this time.

361 liquor schools have been granted permission in the past. This is a political bribery. These have been made on the recommendation of MPs. It was announced during the election campaign that we would reveal this. But even though all the liquor schools were allowed, they were given in the recommendation of any MPs.

This is a type of political bribery. The High Court has a case regarding how many schools a district should be located. I hope that its verdict will be released in January.

### Social media is also a reason for my failure - Douglas Devananda

Douglas Devananda attributes election loss to social media misinformation. He claims false propaganda spread via social platforms contributed to his defeat. The former fisheries minister accuses a Jaffna businessman of spreading slander, citing unresolved trade issues as motivation.

🟩

Former Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said social media was also the reason for my failure.

We have a setback in this election. It can also be called a temporary rest in politics. When was the minister, there was work on the head. At present it is not.

Thus we examine the reduction within the party. We have taken steps to address the grievances and take steps to bring the people to the policy of the party. We will also hold the party's national conference very soon.

Social websites are responsible for the fall of Douglas and the rise of Anura. They carried out false propaganda against me through social websites.

They do not exacerbate their videos because they do not want to prevent their income because they are using my name.

News can be seen through newspapers, televisions and radio in the past. Currently, with a hand phone, from the sewage to the bedroom to the bedroom, it is easy to watch the videos, so it reaches people.
