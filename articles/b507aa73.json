    "Historically, education was conducted outdoors under trees, using stone slabs as tools. Over time, buildings and books became integral to the educational process. However, the advent of mobile phones has introduced new dynamics. Education has evolved from traditional temple-based learning to modern classroom settings. Today, technology such as smart classrooms is revolutionising education.",

We are committed to fostering social justice by redressing the challenges confronting women and girls. Both bills are slated for passage in June. I have initiated discussions with the Prime Minister to augment female representation in local government elections following the presidential and general elections. It is our aspiration to ensure at least a 25% representation of women in parliamentary seats and to bolster their presence in provincial councils.",

We achieve this by imparting knowledge in information technology and language skills. We have set up over 130 DP IT Campuses so far.",
    "Research has revealed that women have three main concerns. One is food for the family, second is education for kids and third is sexual harassment. The Good Gestures for Empowerment of women and girls addresses the third challenge. Today there are only eight signs which are universally used and Sri Lanka via the GG Empowerment movement will add three more.",
