    "Ceylinco General Insurance recently organised an island-wide Beach Clean-up program along the coastline of Sri Lanka with the participation of its staff from its island-wide branches and from the head office. This clean-up initiative was held for the second consecutive year and the Beach Clean-up event has now been made an annual event in the company\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility calendar.",
    "Beaches in Sri Lanka have become polluted coastlines and Ceylinco General Insurance believes it is the duty of all citizens, both individual and corporates, to help preserve the natural beauty and cleanliness of our beaches and the ocean surrounding our island.",
    "In organising and conducting the initiative, over 850 employees selflessly volunteered to clear debris, plastics and polythene waste from the shoreline. The litter was collected and segregated in separate disposable bags. The collected waste was handed over to the solid waste disposable units of Municipal Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas of the respective areas for disposal in a sustainable manner.",
