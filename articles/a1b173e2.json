    "Flood storage, sediment control, water quality improvement, preventing shoreline erosion and protection, providing habitats for plants, fish and wildlife, acting as Biodiversity Reservoirs, serving as breeding, nursery and feeding grounds for aquatic organisms are some of the main ecological functions. Human-Use Values include flood protection, storm Protection, nutrient transformation, removal and storage, non-consumptive recreation, commercial Fishery and aquaculture.",
    "Reclamation of wetlands for other uses without understanding of the functioning of coastal ecosystems and the ecological services that they provide, have resulted in environmental degradation, pollution, depletion of natural resources, reduction in biodiversity, and social conflicts depriving communities to their access and traditional sustainable resource extraction patterns.",
    "Coastal wetlands with mangroves, mangrove associates, saltmarshes, mudflats, seagrass beds, are the most threatened wetland areas in Sri Lanka due to high land demand for urbanization, agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, salterns and other industrial development.",
    "Rapid expansion in coastal aquaculture poses the major threat to wetlands reducing the area of sensitive ecosystems and releasing partially treated effluents to lagoons, estuaries and near shore coastal areas.",
    "Join us at the NTB WNPS Lecture to gain insights into the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these vulnerable ecosystems from the detrimental impacts of industrial development and aquaculture expansion.",
