    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will present an amendment to the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) Act to ensure an equitable treatment in restructuring domestic debt, an SJB legislator said.",
    "MP Harsha de Silva told reporters on Wednesday July 12 that the party will propose an amendment that, if passed, will see a minimum benefit paid to EPF members or pay the same interest rate paid to other players in the market, or a rate that reflects inflation.",
    "The amendment will be proposed with 2.6 million active EPF accounts in mind over the next 15 years during which Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt restructuring (DDR) will be in effect, said de Silva.",
    "Opposition parties in Sri Lanka according to the SJB have criticed the DDR programme over alleged injustice to EPF members.",
    "The EPF is managed by Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank, which in legal terms is its Monetary Board. It is the country\u2019s single largest fund amounting to around 3.4 trillion rupees at present and is also the largest holder of treasury bonds \u2013 about 36 percent \u2013 which in turn make up over 90 percent of the fund\u2019s total investments.",
    "A claim by SJB and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa that the EPF would lose 12 trillion rupees over 15 years as a result of the DDR\u00a0 exercise was recently refuted by Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe who said it was a misrepresentation of reality.",
    "\u201cYou have to consider the entire picture. Anyone is welcome to make alternative proposals, but we have so far not seen any other equitable proposal.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for anyone to nitpick and mislead the public. That\u2019s all I have to say,\u201d said Weerasinghe.",
