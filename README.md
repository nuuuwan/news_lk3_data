As I sat down at the lunch table recently, the guest across from me asked what I did for a living. After I responded, she and her neighbor revealed that they were alternative medicine specialists. Then she winked and remarked, “we see myocarditis left and right.” “ Here we go again,” I thought to myself. I also pondered how challenging it is to diagnose myocarditis — an inflammation of the heart muscle often thought to be caused by COVID vaccines much more frequently than it actually is — even for a cardiologist. But that’s a discussion for another day.

Dissimilarities in dress and manner aside, they share more commonalities than usually recognised. Methods could vary, the goal is the same, power by any means. Power is not something new to them, for nearly 25 years now, they have headed alternate governments, if not directly, by proxy. They want more, a craving that cannot apparently be gratified. Going on their record, neither deserves power. Economically as well as socially, the country is on its knees today, hopeless, its institutions in shambles; surely in these 25 years, something could have been done to avoid this plight or in the very least, forewarned the country of the impending disaster

### Duplicate NIC numbers delay Sri Lanka’s Aswesuma beneficiaries receiving payment: official

ECONOMYNEXT – Thousands of Sri Lanka’s Aswesuma poverty alleviation beneficiaries face delay in receiving funds due to duplication of their national identity card (NIC) numbers, a top government official said.

Despite the government approving 1.8 million households as Aswesuma beneficiaries from last year’s applicants, still around 200,000 beneficiaries have not received any benefits, the official said.

“When you include their details into the system, it shows two people have the same national identity card numbers,” Jayantha Wijerathne, Chairman of the Welfare Benefits Board, told EconomyNext on Monday (22).

“This may be due to manual production of the identity cards in the past. When there is duplication of NIC numbers, the system rejects the beneficiaries from being paid.”

“Now we have informed these duplicate identity cardholders via text messages and to rectify this issue. Once this is sorted, we will pay them the full amount with effect from July last year.”
