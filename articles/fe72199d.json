    "Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka are likely to surpass the 100,000 mark, while falling behind the target of 120,934 -131,112 arrivals in May.",
    "Provisional data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority showed tourist arrivals recording a moderate growth reaching 79,431 in the first three weeks of the month (from 1st of May to 21st of May) when compared to 83,309 arrivals recorded in May last year.",
    "The daily arrival average is about 3,782, a drop from the 5,000 level experienced in the previous months.",
    "From April, till the summer season, the influx of tourists remains low, as it is an off-peak period. However, the visa fiasco might have also contributed to the drop in the month according to authorities.",
    "India became by far the largest tourist traffic generator for the month, accounting for 26 percent of the total arrivals. Ranking second is the Maldives, contributing to 11 percent of the arrivals.",
    "Russia which occupied top two spots in tourist arrivals has fallen to 7th position so far in May. According to some industry stakeholders, Russian charters which earlier flew to Mattala International Airport had decided to fly into other competing destinations this summer amidst the price hike in hotel rooms and landing charges.",
    "Germany jumped into third position, accounting for 8 percent of total arrivals followed by United Kingdom accounting for 7 percent in total arrivals. China is now among the top five markets. For May so far, China has contributed 6 percent to the total arrivals and ranked fifth."
