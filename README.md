### ‘The known devil’: Untangling the biased brain

*2024-09-20 05:53:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/The-known-devil-Untangling-the-biased-brain/14-766925) · `en`

A voter might favour a course of action because it aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, and not because it is necessarily the best choice – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Birds build nests. Spiders spin intricate webs. Dogs bury bones. The salmon swims upstream. Babies suckle. These are not learned behaviours. They are instincts and reflexive behaviours that we are born with. They are important because they help us adapt to our environment and to survive.

In contrast, ‘learning’ is a change in an organism’s behaviour or thought or knowledge, as a result of experience. Learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience. We have learned when we have changed. But in Sri Lanka, it seems, that we never learn. This is a pithy that is often expressed.

Learning involves complex processes of conscious and unconscious processes. If you have tried to learn a new language or a skill like playing a musical instrument, you will know that learning is not always easy and that outcomes vary.

### Role of second preference: a simulation of 2024 Presidential election in Sri Lanka

*2024-09-20 05:49:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Role-of-second-preference-a-simulation-of-2024-Presidential-election-in-Sri-Lanka/4-766924) · `en`

It will be wise to mark a second preference in this election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Sri Lanka awaits the election of its 10th President in a political landscape that has not been seen before in history. For the first time, at least three frontrunners are contending for the presidency – as opposed to the usual bi-candidate race – with a certain possibility of none achieving an over-half majority vote. This new structure of contest has affected many socio-political dimensions of the election.

However, in this article, we wish to focus on how the presence of more than two major candidates would affect the existing voting system and the mathematics governing its outcome. This simulation – rather than a modelling to predict the next president of Sri Lanka – is a critique of the systems designed to measure our social choice, their strengths and limitations in upholding the fundamental notions of democracy.

Whatever the results and whoever sits on the presidential chair on Sunday 22 September, future of Sri Lanka would not be favourably decided until a new parliament is elected – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Now the countdown to the three-cornered presidential tussle is on days, not weeks. Perhaps in another three or four days, Presidential elections will be held on 21 September. That final result will be decided by the majority rural vote, seldom heard in major urban circles.

### 2024 Presidential elections: A mission impossible for many aspirers

*2024-09-20 05:37:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/2024-Presidential-elections-A-mission-impossible-for-many-aspirers/4-766921) · `en`

These voters have during all the previous elections casted the vote to the candidates of their choice. The important factor here is how they change their choice from time to time

Since of late, Sri Lankan Presidential elections have become a battleground with the number of candidates progressively growing. Last Presidential election held on 16 November 2019 fielded 36 contestants while the 2024 candidacy increased to 38 numbers but ironically due to the demise of one candidate the number came down to 37 as of today.

When we look at the results of the last Presidential election in 2019, the contest was polarised between two main candidates, and the final result was:

All 33 other candidates polled a total of 2.6% of the total valid votes with the highest polling 0.37%.

### No economic policy will work with rampant corruption

*2024-09-20 05:34:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/No-economic-policy-will-work-with-rampant-corruption/4-766920) · `en`

Going to the IMF 17 times is adequate proof that all economic policies of the past have not worked due to rampant corruption

Generally, at crucial times like elections, many people try to become economic wizards by expressing concerns of economic policy without having even a semblance of understanding of how a country’s economy, the Central Bank and the Treasury work, and in the present scenario, how the IMF is formed, operated and funded. It is of course trendy to say about good or bad economic policies purely to promote political bias without any knowledge in what is generally perceived as an esoteric domain.

To understand and analyse economic policies is very good. Then, policies of all competing parties ought to be critically analysed impartially. But what invariably happens is to dismiss policies of others due to preconceived notions. That is really the reluctance to deviate from narrow-minded political affiliations.

### Presidents may come and go but JR’s Executive Presidency goes on forever

*2024-09-20 05:30:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Presidents-may-come-and-go-but-JR-s-Executive-Presidency-goes-on-forever/4-766919) · `en`

The blame for almost everything that has gone wrong in Sri Lanka has been laid at the door of JR’s Executive Presidency

Sri Lanka’s ninth Presidential election will be held on Saturday 21 September. More than 17 million (17,140,354) Sri Lankans are registered as eligible voters. Nominally 38 candidates are in the ring but only three are regarded as the leading contenders. The hectic election campaigns ended on 18 September but election fever is high. A large voter turnout is expected on election day.

It is indeed an irony that there is so much of enthusiasm over the election of the executive president despite the criticism directed against the executive presidential system in past years. The Executive Presidency is blamed extensively on the one hand while the country gets involved in presidential poll excitement on the other.

### Election 2024: the real winner is the consumer

The top 4 brands were hit on the reality of the consumer at elections 2024

The last three months has been one of the most interesting times that has really intrigued me. The reason being that I saw the ‘fundamentals of marketing’ in reality. The top four brands – Anura, Sajith, Ranil and Namal launched their campaign with a typical product related/ideological communication campaign and they faced reality where people’s attention could not be elucidated, people complained about coming for meetings, the TV channels captured the disconnect. In my view this was the first time a product owner and consumer (voter) met face to face after the economic collapse.
