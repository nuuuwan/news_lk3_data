    "Mr. Rao was part of a group of 31 swimmers who held a relay swimming event from Sri Lanka to India through the Palk Strait. The swimmers had left Rameswaram by a boat, and had gone to Sri Lanka on April 22. At 12.10 a.m. on April 23, they began swimming from Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka towards Dhanushkodi.",
    "Gopal Rao, believed to have been the third swimmer on the row, began feeling uneasy and complained of chest pains at 3.10 a.m. He was immediately helped to get into the boat that was accompanying the swimmers. The doctor attending on him however, subsequently declared that he was dead.",
    "As a mark of respect, all the other swimmers cancelled the relay event and reached Dhanushkodi islet by boat.",
    "The body has been sent for a post-mortem to the Rameswaram Government Hospital. The Rameswaram Town police have registered a case.",
