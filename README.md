### Digitalisation or dependency? Sri Lanka’s AI dilemma beyond AKD’s binary

*2025-09-22 23:54:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Digitalisation-or-dependency-Sri-Lanka-s-AI-dilemma-beyond-AKD-s-binary/4-782027) · `en`

A binary “digitalise or perish” narrative must give way to a measured path

President Anura Kumara Disanayake has cast digital transformation as a stark binary: either embrace artificial intelligence (AI) and modernise, or be “pushed to the margins” of the global economy. His appeal identifies inefficiency, stagnation, and weak public services as consequences of past inaction. This rhetoric mirrors global leaders who treat AI as a “pillar” of competitiveness and a survival imperative.

Yet such framing is both motivational and reductionist. It risks presenting digitalisation as a technological silver bullet, obscuring the deeper questions of sovereignty, governance, and inequality that must shape Sri Lanka’s pathway.

Adam Becker cautions against equating AI with an autonomous “brain” destined to rebel against humanity. The metaphor of AI as a computer like mind is flawed, he argues, and “existential risk” talk distracts from tangible, present day harms1.

### Nepal’s uprising and lessons for South Asia

*2025-09-22 23:39:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Nepal-s-uprising-and-lessons-for-South-Asia/4-782025) · `en`

The uprisings in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka all reveal the same underlying dynamic: a critical 5% of society—small but decisive—determines the trajectory of these crises

Nepal was recently engulfed in a wave of fierce public unrest that forced the Prime Minister to resign. The uprising left vast destruction in its wake: national assets worth millions were lost, and numerous five-star hotels in Kathmandu were set ablaze. Videos flooded social media, showing enraged crowds dragging politicians through the streets while setting their homes on fire.

Observers quickly drew parallels with Sri Lanka’s “Aragalaya” (Struggle) of 2022. Bangladesh too had experienced a similar upheaval, when its Prime Minister was driven to seek refuge in India.

### What Doha delivered: Diplomacy beyond the podium

The Doha summit stands as a potent act of collective diplomacy

When Qatar hosted the Arab-Islamic emergency summit on 15 September 2025—just days after an Israeli strike in Doha killed Hamas leaders and a Qatari officer—expectations were high. Could this gathering produce more than a chorus of protest speeches? Would it reshape regional alignments, force policy shifts, or deepen legal and military responses? As the dust settles, Doha emerges as a significant diplomatic moment that combined high symbolism with cautious substance.1

The Northern Provincial Ministry of Education should be replaced by the Northern Provincial Ministry of Education. The protest was carried out by the Shiv Sena organization on Monday (22) in front of the Northern Province Department of Education, located at the Stamp Junction.

Allegations have been made that the Chancellor appointed to the Kilinochchi St. Teresa School was appointed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Education of the Northern Province.

At the same time, some schools in Kilinochchi have not yet been appointed permanent Chancellor.

In this case, a group of people in the "cup" vehicle from Kilinochchi introduced themselves as the Development Association representatives of the Teresa School, and went to the Shiv Sena organization's struggle.

As a result of the tense situation, the police, who were on duty, chased away the confused persons.

### Israel bolsters military presence over Jewish New Year holiday period

Combat soldiers who were still in training would be providing support and be alert for “defensive and offensive tasks” throughout the holiday period, which begins on September 22 with the Jewish New Year and lasts until around mid-October.

The military declined to comment when asked if it was a preemptive measure or in response to a specific threat.

Earlier this year, Israeli media reported that the military had ended its long-standing practice of granting unit-wide leave during holidays.

The decision followed a military investigation that found Hamas took advantage of the reduced troop presence along the Gaza border on October 7, 2023, during a Jewish holiday, to launch its attack, according to media reports.

### World summit to meet on two-state solution as support grows for Palestinian state

France and Saudi Arabia will convene dozens of world leaders on Monday to rally support for a two-state solution, with several of them expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state - a move that could draw harsh Israeli and U.S. responses.

While the summit could boost the morale of Palestinians, it is not expected to deliver change on the ground, where the most far-right government in Israel’s history has declared there will be no Palestinian state as it pushes on with its war against Hamas in Gaza.

Efforts to create a two-state solution have failed to make any progress for decades as violence raged.

Israel and the United States will boycott the summit, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon, said, describing the event as a “circus.”

Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal all recognised a Palestinian state on Sunday. France and five other states are expected to also formally recognise a Palestinian state on Monday.

### GovPay boosts traffic fine payments in Sri Lanka: Official

*2025-09-22 14:14:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/govpay-boosts-traffic-fine-payments-in-sri-lanka-official-241503/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has seen an increase in traffic fine payments since GovPay, the state digital payment platform, was implemented in the Western Province, an official involved in the initiative has said.

“Traffic fine payments via GovPay continue to climb, with yesterday recording the highest volume since the Western Province went live,” Harsha Purasinghe, Board Director of ICTA, said on the social media platform X.

GovPay lets citizens and businesses make digital payments for government services like taxes, fines, and utility bills through banks and digital wallets.

The initiative is a collaboration between LankaPay and the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA).

“While GovPay is delivering unmatched convenience and transparency for citizens, Sri Lanka Police plans to introduce a demerit points system in the future, alongside digital payments,” Purasinghe said.

### Waste & Accountability: Why Institutions Must Lead By Example

*2025-09-22 13:23:21* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/waste-accountability-why-institutions-must-lead-by-example/) · `en`

Across South Asia, institutions from hospitals to universities and government offices have no shortage of waste management policies. Documents are signed, committees formed, and declarations issued. Yet walk into the backyards of these same institutions, and the story looks very different. Biomedical waste left in open bins, hazardous chemicals poured down drains, and overflowing bins where plastic, paper, and food waste are all dumped together.

The gap between what policies states and how they are practiced is more than just an administrative oversight. It weakens public trust and puts communities at serious risk. When hospitals fail to dispose of biomedical waste safely, they don’t just put their own staff at risk they endanger sanitation workers, patients, their families, and entire neighborhoods. When schools or universities treat waste as an afterthought, they send a message to young people that environmental safety is negotiable.

### Sri Lankan anglers join fight against invasive giant snakehead fish

A native of southeast Asia, giant snakehead fish are considered an invasive species in many countries. Kept as pets they can cause massive ecological harm when released into rivers or dams.

Anglers from all over the south Asian island flocked to a dam on the Deduru Oya river, 130 km (80 miles) from the commercial capital Colombo, on Saturday to target the pest.

Curious spectators cheered on the participants while sampling pickles, fried snacks and ice cream along the dam’s tree-lined embankment.

Despite the turnout, giant snakeheads proved elusive with only 22 caught.

“This is the first time I’ve participated in a fishing competition,” said Sandaruwan, a 37-year-old farmer, who hooked three fish.
