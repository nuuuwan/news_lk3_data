  "original_body_lines": [
    "A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Sunday, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) reported.",
    "The quake occurred at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), the GFZ added. No immediate reports of casualties or damage have been released. Authorities are monitoring the situation.",
    "This latest tremor comes just days after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake shook Indonesia\u2019s eastern Papua region on Tuesday, sending tremors through the area.",
    "The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at about 5:24 pm local time (0824 GMT), with its epicentre located roughly 193 kilometres northwest of the town of Abepura in Papua.",
    "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre confirmed that there was no danger of a tsunami following the quake.",
    "Indonesia has been rattled by a series of earthquakes in recent weeks. The archipelago is part of the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, a highly volatile zone where tectonic plates collide, triggering frequent seismic activity.",
    "Sitting at the convergence of the Eurasian, Pacific, and Indo-Australian plates, Indonesia experiences constant tectonic movement that unleashes earthquakes, often in areas such as Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. The region\u2019s restless plates ensure that tremors remain a persistent threat, making ongoing vigilance and disaster preparedness essential.",
    "In recent weeks, earthquakes ranging from magnitude 5.0 to 7.1 have struck Java, Sumatra, and other regions, causing panic but little to no major casualties or damage, according to local authorities."
