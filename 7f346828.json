    "The Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) has attributed an increase in road accidents to weaknesses in the public transport sector.",
    "Its chairman Gemunu Wijerathne identified the use of smaller vehicles like motorcycles, three-wheelers, vans and cars as a major cause of frequent accidents.",
    "Wijerathne added that not keeping up with developments in the public transport sector has also contributed to the problem.",
    "He noted that the reduction in petrol prices has resulted in people choosing to use their own vehicles for transportation, further exacerbating the issue.",
    "The chairman highlight the need for improvements in the public transport sector to reduce the number of accidents on Sri Lanka's roads.",
    "By promoting the use of safe and reliable modes of public transportation, such as buses and trains, the country can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and enhance road safety, he said.",
    "It is important for the government and private sector to work together to address the weaknesses in the public transport sector and promote the use of sustainable transportation options for the benefit of all, Wijerathne added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
