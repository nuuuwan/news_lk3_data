### Rubber industry calls for SVAT removal delay, warns of liquidity crunch

ECONOMYNEXT – A Sri Lanka rubber traders group has said the government’s decision to abolish the Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) scheme from October 1 would cause ‘severe and far-reaching consequences’, and urged it to differ or phase it out.

“Removing SVAT without a tested and operational refund mechanism will trigger widespread financial distress across Sri Lanka’s natural rubber industry, threatening smallholder livelihoods, SME viability, export competitiveness, and foreign exchange inflows vital to the nation’s recovery,” the Colombo Rubber Traders’ Association (CRTA) said in a statement.

Sri Lanka’s natural rubber sector supports tens of thousands of smallholder farmers, CRTA pointed out.

“The removal of SVAT will force manufacturers to pay billions in VAT upfront, causing delays in purchasing raw rubber and exerting downward pressure on farm gate prices.”

### United Nations arms embargo, other sanctions reimposed on Iran

*2025-09-28 06:42:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112977/united-nations-arms-embargo-other-sanctions-reimposed-on-iran) · `en`

The United Nations reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran on Saturday following a process triggered by key European powers that Tehran has warned will be met with a harsh response.

Britain, France and Germany triggered the return of sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council over accusations the country has violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.

The end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites.

U.N. sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday (0000 GMT). Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. this week.
