    "As we approach Sri Lanka Leopard Day on August 1, the WNPS is delighted to welcome Dr. Jeannine Stephanie McManus, a global expert in human-wildlife conflict mitigation, to share her insights on fostering human-leopard coexistence in Sri Lanka.

Dr. McManus\u2019s expertise offers valuable perspectives on addressing these issues.",
    "Dr. McManus is affiliated with the Landmark Foundation, a conservation organization in South Africa, that promotes and facilitates conservation land uses. The leopard is central to the Landmark Foundation owing to its iconic status as the last remaining top predator naturally occurring in South African mountain ranges.",

As Acting Director of the Landmark Foundation Leopard and Predator Conservation Project, she has spearheaded initiatives to create wildlife-friendly landscapes and reduce conflicts between humans and carnivores.
