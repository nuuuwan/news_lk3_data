    "Colombo, May 12 (Daily Mirror) - Some people make popular statements from political platforms in the guise of continuing to develop and maintain the school lunch programme by spending Rs. 26 billion for 1.7 million children, covering all students in the primary grades in the country, said Education Minister Susil Premajayantha.",
    "While participating as the chief guest at the inauguration of the new six-storied dormitory complex built earlier for the students of the German Tech Institute, Minister Premajayantha said the politicians who claim that all schoolchildren in the country will receive lunch should have conducted a practical numerical analysis before making such statements."
