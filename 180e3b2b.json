  "original_body_lines": [
    "Irrespective of the recent unfortunate incidents involving the quality of medicines, the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) urged the people not to be carried away by such incidents and thereby lose trust on the free healthcare services.",
    "During a media conference held today (17), SLMA Chairman Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne acknowledged the challenges faced by the Sri Lankan health sector but emphasized that it would be unfair to judge the entire system based on isolated incidents.",
    "He highlighted the importance of conducting proper investigations to determine if the incidents were linked to inferior quality drugs before drawing any conclusions.",
    "Hence, Dr. Ariyaratne requested the public to continue seeking medical assistance from government hospitals.",
    "\"In this endeavour, the Government and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that only the highest quality medicines are made available to the public,\" he stressed. (Shean Fernandopulle)"
