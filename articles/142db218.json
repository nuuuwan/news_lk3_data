    "It is totally unnecessary to explain the choice of subject of my article today \u2013 the day after the presidential election. We have voted and I am sure as of this morning of September 22, the new President or the next five years, is still to be announced. After all, our Sunday newspapers are printed on the Saturday night, some even on Friday. Most unlikely a stop press announcement will be made in the print media.",
    "The definition of a statesman is: \u201cA skilled, experienced, and respected political leader or figure.\u201d Are any of Sri Lanka\u2019s 39 contenders for the presidency such? A definite no is the answer I get from myself.",
    "Is the oldest of them with about 50 years experience in active politics (joined UNP in the 1970s); six times Prime Minister and in 2022 pushed into being President, a statesman? Ranil Wickremesinghe should be considered one since he is skilled and very experienced. Also his family and educational backgrounds qualify him to be one. But where does the doubt come in? In the last of the three qualifications in the definition: respected. Very unfortunately during his career he has somewhat smudged his copybook. Thus he is not popular with the majority of Sri Lankans. Prior to this election he was pushed to third place in the predictions of polls results.",
    "What about the other two of this triumvirate. Sajith Premadasa: skilled? OK passable. Experienced? Yes. Respected? Yes by some, but falls short of being considered a statesman \u2013 as yet. He has years ahead and the chance to rise to be a statesman. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is not experienced nor skilled in country leadership. Most don\u2019t know who he really is and many are afraid of him as leader of the country. So he is no statesman. The young Rajapaksa may consider himself to be close in his father\u2019s footsteps and charismatic and loved by all. Mahinda R was no statesman whatsoever. Namal lacks all three stated qualifications plus he is burdened with his surname, which now is a millstone but may reduce its pull downwards with people forgetting the past and him coming into his own from out the shadow of his father and uncle.",
    "Wikipedia, the usual online encyclopedia I consult, gave me a miles long list of powerful leaders, country by country. Maybe it did not take into account my qualifier: Best. Other sites had various names. I picked out the persons given below with relevant details of each and my comments. They were political leaders of their countries. They are not mentioned in ascending or descending order of greatness; you cannot grade them thus, having such diverse pluses.",
    "Queen Elizabeth II. Do not scream she is not in the men category. Now the feminine gender is ignored in many common nouns. Actors are both female and male, the noun actress going obsolete. Hence Her Majesty is a statesman. She may not have ruled a country but she was the Head of State as Britain was and is a monarchy. She is called a titular head too as she held an official position with few actual powers.",
    "Her greatness was unique. She was very gracious, most dignified, loved the Commonwealth and Britain and its people. She assumed duties as Queen on February 5, 1952, and was a most respected and conscientious queen till September 8, 2022. At her coronation when just 25 years old, she vowed she would serve her realm devotedly until the end of her life. And she did it, overcoming a few public travails and many personal ones. She worked with 11 prime ministers and at her golden jubilee pronounced: \u201cChange has become a constant; managing it has become an expanding discipline. The way we embrace it defines our future.\u201d The phrase \u2018truly great\u2019 suits her.",
    "(b 1961), the 44th president of the US and the first of mixed racial parentage \u2013 half black \u2013 won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his efforts at strengthening international diplomacy. In his farewell address in 2017 after two terms as president from 2009, he said: \u201cUnderstanding democracy does not require uniformity. Our founders argued, they quarreled and eventually they compromised.\u201d Of course he was criticized and some thought he did not deserve the Nobel award, having ordered the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Holding two consecutive terms as President of the US is proof of his greatness. He was a straight standing man and the best orator, in my opinion superseding Jawaharlal Nehru and Winston Churchill.",
    "It\u2019s so good to have another woman in my chosen list \u2013  Jacinda Arden (b 1980). She was PM of New Zealand from October 2017 to January 2023, relinquishing her premiership while still very popular. She felt she had done her best as leader of NZ and now it was time to pass the torch on as she wished to retire to being an ordinary citizen caring for her home, husband and daughter.",
    "She was a completely no-nonsense person, with deep humane feelings \u2013 she hugged Muslims after the mosque massacre. Her greatness was known internationally by the way she managed the Covid 19 pandemic through which NZ navigated very well. She passed laws for the well-being of women, children and families. She highlighted issues of climate change; promoted Kiwi culture; vouched for the LGBTQ and minorities. \u201cShe advocated raising voices through empathy, unity and compassion, which are innate qualities for famous leaders in the world.\u201d She said; \u201cLeadership is about empathy and empowering people.\u201d She took pride in being a woman. \u201cI never grew up as a young woman believing that my gender would stand in the way of doing anything I wanted.\u201d",
    "Many Internet lists had Volodymyr Zelensky (b 1978) as a statesman. Accepted fact. Born in 1978, he was a former entertainer \u2013 in truth a comedian \u2013and is now the sixth president of Ukraine having to face the Russian invasion which started in 2020. He is seen to be a bulwark against aggression and he has pleaded for and successfully obtained NATO and western nations\u2019 support to overcome the aggression. \u201cAs dictator Putin exhibits many of the most lamentable human traits in his pursuit of revanchist Russian nationalism, Zelensky has elicited a contrasting, courageous nationalism among Ukranian people who have endured some of the most grievous violence of the past century. Routinely compared with Winston Churchill, Zelensky is reviving heretofore fading notions of courage and character, adroitly applying twentieth century social media.\u201d He appears to be a statesman, having started his high official career in 2019. He certainly is a world figure now \u2013 in his favoured casual wear of T-Shirt and pants.",
    "(b 1953), is general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party; chairman of the Central Military Commission and thus the paramount leader of China since 2012. He has been the President of the People\u2019s Republic of China since 2013. He may be presented as a stern dictator by western media, but it must be admitted he has brought China to be the second most powerful nation or even on par with the USA. He is undoubtedly a statesman though the annexation of Tibet is a huge blot. Maybe one could say this occurred before Xi\u2019s leadership.",
    "Great leader not statesman Narendra Modi (b 1950), has served as Indian PM since May 2014 before which he was Chief Minister of Gujerat from 2001 to 2014. That period when he allowed rioting and the mass murder of Muslims has undeniably black marked his career as a very prominent and hard working head of government. Additionally, the religious slant, sometimes very strong and even violent of the Bharatiya Janatha Party has resulted in India not being truly secular. So Modi falls short of being a statesman.",
    "What is hoped for is that with the probable \u2018system change\u2019 the winner of SL\u2019s 2024 presidential election will usher in (him not necessarily AKD), a new era for us. We may still have a true statesman emerging from the generally rotten mire that is the political arena of Sri Lanka. The leader has to be loyal to Sri Lanka and devoted, doing his best for the country and its people. He has to be dedicated, subvert all selfish tendencies for bettering himself, his family and supporters, and be just. I need not spell them out. Qualities to be emulated and nurtured are evident in the persons I have listed above, some from each, like humaneness from Arden, discipline from Xi Jingpin.",
    "Atlanta celebrated Jimmy Carter\u2019s hundredth year of life at the Fox Theater on Wednesday, September 18; Carter and wife Rosalyn being from Plains, Georgia. Born on October 1, 1924, Jimmy served in the navy and then was a peanut farmer. Winning a Senate seat, he moved on to being president of the USA from 1977 to 1981. Retiring, he joined Habitat and manually and financially helped to build houses in many countries for the poor. He was not considered terribly effectual during his presidency, but now his statesmanship is being celebrated.",
