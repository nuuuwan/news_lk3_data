    "Donald Trump has rejected suggestions that the warming of relations between China, Russia and their allies poses a challenge to the US on the global stage.",
    "The US president told reporters in the Oval Office that he had \u201ca good relationship\u201d with President Xi Jinping and that China \u201cneeds us more than we need them\u201d.",
    "It comes as Xi prepares to host world leaders at a \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade in Beijing on Wednesday - a showcase of China\u2019s military might.",
    "Xi will be joined by North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, viewed by some observers as a message to the Western nations that have shunned them.",
    "China has sought to position itself as a possible counterweight to the US since Trump\u2019s tariffs rocked the global economic and political order.",
    "Trump has pitched his tariffs as essential to protecting American interests and industry. It appears that any diplomatic cost is something he is willing to pay.",
    "Asked by the BBC if he believed Beijing and its allies were attempting to form an international coalition to oppose the US, Trump said: \u201cNo. Not at all. China needs us.\u201d",
    "He added: \u201cI have a very good relationship with President Xi, as you know. But China needs us much more than we need them. I don\u2019t see that at all.\u201d",
    "Separately, in a radio interview on Tuesday, Trump said he was not concerned about the axis forming between Russia and China.",
    "He told the Scott Jennings radio show that America has \u201cthe most powerful military forces in the world\u201d and that \u201cthey would never use their military forces against us\u201d.",
    "\u201cBelieve me, that would be the worst thing they could ever do,\u201d he said.",
    "Elsewhere in the interview, Trump said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Putin, after they failed to reach a peace deal for Ukraine during their meeting in Alaska last month.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in President Putin, I can say that,\u201d Trump said, adding that the US \u201cwill be doing something to help people live\u201d in Ukraine. He did not specify.",
    "China has not criticised Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion and has been accused by the West of aiding Russia\u2019s war effort through its supply of dual-use materials and purchases of Russian oil. Beijing denies this.",
    "Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was engaged in a new troop build up along certain sectors of the frontline.",
    "\u201c[Putin] refuses to be forced into peace,\u201d Zelensky said in his nightly video address."
