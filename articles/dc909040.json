    "There are around 1,000 registered pig farms in the Western Province with 40,000 to 50,000 pigs, but the number is believed to be under-reported by farmers, he said.",
    "The numbers being brought forward for vaccination show that farmers had previously under-reported flocks, he said.",
    "It takes about 6 to 8 months to grown and slaughter a pig and in any case the figure is dynamic, he said.",

    "Regardless of whether people can contract the disease from eating cooked pork, it always recommended that only healthy animals free from whatever infectious disease is consumed, Sarath said.",
    "Though there were requirements for inspection of cattle before and after they are killed to ensure that only healthy animals are slaughtered for consumption, no such regulations exist for pigs, Rohana said.",
    "It was not clear whether how the outbreak occurred. (Colombo/Oct29/2024)"
