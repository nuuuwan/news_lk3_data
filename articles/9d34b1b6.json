    "Highlighting the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government\u2019s stance on media freedom, Dr. Jayatissa said that while the administration supports and safeguards journalistic independence, it will not tolerate the misuse of media platforms for political agendas or the dissemination of false, harmful, or manipulated information.",
