    "Sampath Bank recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs 24.4 Bn and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 14.7 Bn for the first half of 2025, marking a robust year-on-year growth of 32% across both metrics compared to the same period in 2024. The Sampath Group reported a PBT of Rs 26.0 Bn and a PAT of Rs 15.6 Bn, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 32% at both PBT and PAT levels.",
    "During the six-month period ended 30th June 2025, Sampath Bank reported total interest income of Rs 89.4 Bn, a 6% year-on-year decline primarily driven by the downward trend in the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPLR) and reduced yields from government securities. The Bank\u2019s interest expenses recorded a corresponding decline of 6% to Rs 50.8 Bn for the period. These resulted in the Bank\u2019s Net Interest Income (NII) declining by 6% year-on-year to Rs 38.6 Bn and the Net Interest Margin (NIM) declining by 66 basis points, from 4.90% on 31st December 2024 to 4.24% as at 30th June 2025.",
    "During the first half of 2025, the Bank reported total non-fund based income of Rs 15.9 Bn, marking a substantial year-on-year growth of 122%.",
    "Net fee and commission income increased by 12% against 1H 2024, driven by higher contributions across multiple channels, including credit, card, trade, operations, and electronic banking services. The Bank recorded a total exchange gain of Rs 2.4 Bn during the first half of 2025, reflecting a significant improvement compared to the exchange loss of Rs 2.7 Bn in the first half of the previous year. This gain was primarily attributable to the depreciation of LKR against USD by Rs 6.58.",
    "The Bank reported a total impairment charge of Rs 1.4 Bn for the period under review, a 78% decline compared to the previous period. This included a charge of Rs 1.4 Bn for loans and advances (1H 2024: Rs 3.7 Bn), a charge of Rs 0.6 Bn for other financial assets (1H 2024: Rs 1.0 Bn), and a reversal of Rs 0.6 Bn for credit-related commitments and contingencies (1H 2024: charge of Rs 1.5 Bn).",
    "The Bank reported a 62% year-on-year decline in impairment charges on loans and advances during the first half of 2025 even with a substantial increase in its loan portfolio. This decline in impairment was due to the improvement of credit quality across its customer base fuelled by stronger macro-economic fundamentals of the economy.",
    "The Bank conducted a comprehensive review of its ISL customers, allocating prudent provisions in its Financial Statements tailored to each customer\u2019s unique credit risk profile. Reinforcing its proactive provisioning strategy, the Bank continued its prudent provisioning for collective impairment, ensuring that resilient buffers are maintained to absorb any potential future credit risks. The fundamental impairment models used for collective provisioning remained unchanged from 2024.",
