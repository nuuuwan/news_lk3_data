    "Colombo, April 30 (Daily Mirror) - Vehicle imports may be relaxed either before January next year or before the elections, potentially for political gain during the upcoming election period, Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka (VIAL) President Indika Sampath Merinchige said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said the vehicle imports are for the process of gaining political advantages.",
    "\"When making decisions regarding the resumption of vehicle imports, all responsible individuals must convene around a single table to discuss the matter. Therefore, the government, instead of unilaterally taking decisions, should involve other responsible parties and consider their input,\" Merinchige said.",
    "\"The Finance Ministry, Sri Lanka Customs, Motor Traffic Department, government vehicle importers, private importer associations, the Attorney General's Department and the Minister responsible should convene at a single table to discuss the issues,\" he said.",
    "\"It is inappropriate to make independent decisions on vehicle imports through select sectors. Several Ministers have been making statements about vehicle imports without reaching a definite decision,\" he said.",
    "Merinchige further highlighted that a mere USD one billion was expended in vehicle imports for each of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He proposed that with efficient management, the country could import the necessary vehicles while reducing expenditure to USD 500 million.",
    "However, he pointed out the importance of first establishing a strategy for fund management and determining the types of vehicles required before initiating any imports."
