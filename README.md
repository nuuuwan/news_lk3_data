A group of civil rights activists yesterday staged a protest in front of the Central Bank against latter’s sharp salary increments which has come under much criticism.

“We have gathered here at another State within the country — the Central Bank. It operates autonomously, seemingly unchecked,” Magen Ratata Chairman Sanjaya Mahawatte, asserted.

Accusing CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe of undue influence, Mahawatte claimed that there are alarming discrepancies in the bank’s operations.

“Recently, a bundle of cash went missing, however, when the investigations were conducted by the Fort Police the Governor did not know how much was missing from the stack of money printed at that time. This shows his lack of oversight,” Mahawatte charged.

He also alleged Dr. Weerasinghe of implementing policies that disproportionately affect private sector workers, by reducing the EPF rate to 9%, while exempting CBSL employees from such measures.

### CBSL pay hike: Playing  the fiddle while the country burns

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) salary hike ranging from approx. 29.53% to  79.97% has taken the Nation by storm! This article intends to  show the worthy citizenry of Sri Lanka that the attempts of the Governor/CBSL  to cover up this faux pax  and unconscionable  abuse of powers is utterly fallacious and designed to deceive the people and Parliament of Sri Lanka.

The Governor of the Central Bank has declared the country financially bankrupt, insolvent, unable to pay its debts on 12th April 2022. In this context the Ministry of Finance has issued instructions not to increase any salaries of employees in the Government sector. However, CBSL employees’ salaries have been increased as per Collective Agreement entered into with their Trade Unions.

### Women’s political enthusiasm must be encouraged

*2024-03-12 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Womens-political-enthusiasm-must-be-encouraged/172-278642) · `en`

Sri Lankan women seem to have gained an unprecedented and considerable importance in Sri Lankan politics lately, thanks to the record gatherings of women by JVP/NPP as a part of their show off of power, as the major elections are around the corner.

These gatherings have some sort of copycat effect on some other political parties as well, which is also a good sign, as far as women’s politics is concerned.

It is within that context that the International Women’s Day fell on March 8. Yet, we could witness comparatively fewer commemorative events and media concerns this year, in view of that day.

The need for women’s politics has been felt for a long time not only as they are half or more of the population, but also in most so-called developing countries they play a subservient role in politics, giving up the decision-making right to men in the family, the father, brothers, husband or sons.  Very rarely do women make political decisions totally independent of the male relatives.

As a turbulent world races into year 2024, the  only remaining superpower is a troubled giant (China is a great power, but its military (especially naval) and nuclear forces are still no match for America’s, and it would be economically  disastrous for China to start an arms race with the US now with its economy in  trouble).

The American economy is in trouble, too, with the US dollar losing its value and dire predictions of another Great Depression by next year, though some analysts predict that the US will emerge in better shape from a possible economic crash than any other country in the world.

### No reprieve from Supreme Court: Online Safety Bill and Anti-Terrorism Bill

Analysis of Supreme Court determinations demonstrates many critical issues that adversely impact human rights were not addressed in its deliberations

The Online Safety law and the Anti-Terrorism Bill are two important building blocks in the architecture of repressive laws the Government is constructing. Both were challenged in the Supreme Court, with the Supreme Court finding certain provisions of both unconstitutional. Stakeholders, such as opposition politicians, civic activists, tech companies and the United Nations called upon the Government to, at a minimum, incorporate the Court’s recommendations in the Online Safety Bill before it was enacted. The Government instead passed the law ignoring parliamentary procedure and failed to ensure compliance with Supreme Court determinations.

Malnutrition stunts the brain and affects the body. It is not an issue to be resolved in 2048 – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Contrary to claims of ‘technocrats’ claiming robust progress, there is real, visible, touchable and detectable misery in the heartland. According to the latest WFP country report 17% of the population is facing moderate acute food insecurity. 31% of children aged under 5 are malnourished. 20% of children aged under 5 suffer from wasting. People are compelled to skip meals, beg, or borrow food, or simply learn to live in the gutter, staring at stars

In his recent update to Parliament on the nation’s economy, President Wickremesinghe claimed that it is “widely acknowledged” that Sri Lanka has achieved a certain level of economic stability.

“We’re diligently strengthening the economy each day, striving tirelessly to improve the lives of our people and fortify the economy. Our actions are guided by a strategic plan, ensuring a systematic and methodical approach.”

He insists on not negotiating with the IMF and has outlined amendments to be discussed with the Monetary Fund representatives.

🟩

The International Monetary Fund did not seek negotiations with international credit providers. Parliamentarian Harsha de Silva said he emphasized that negotiations with the loan owners should be transformed and obtained the compliance of the opposition.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe was summoned by the International Monetary Fund on Monday (11). In response, he further stated that he added.

I do not request negotiations with the IMF. Sought negotiations with international credit providers. It is imperative for the government to advance in the wake of the current compliance with the International Monetary Fund.

Therefore, if compliance with international credit providers and financial institutions can be implemented in the future, it would be a crisis for the new government that would rule. In the event of such a situation, the country will be able to repay the bankruptcy and cannot repay the debts.
