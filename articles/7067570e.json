    "NEW DELHI, April 15 ( Times of India) : Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya attributed his team's 20-run defeat in Match 29 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Wankhede Stadium to Chennai Super Kings' Impact Substitute, Sri Lankan pacer Matheesha Pathirana.",
    "Pathirana's impressive spell of 4-28 in four overs turned the tide, disrupting Mumbai's momentum after a strong start at 70 for no loss in the eighth over.",
    "His crucial breakthroughs, including dismissing Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav, derailed Mumbai's innings, despite a valiant century from former skipper Rohit Sharma.",
    "Pandya's decision to bowl first backfired as he faced a barrage from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, conceding 20 runs off four balls. Pandya's batting contribution of two runs off six balls couldn't salvage Mumbai's chase, leading to their fourth defeat in six matches.",
    "Pandya said Pathirana made the difference for CSK as the target for definitely gettable.",
    "\"Definitely, gettable. But they bowled pretty well and Pathirana was the difference. They were smart with their plans and used the longer boundary well,\" said Pandya during the post-match presentation.",
    "Pandya suggested that the CSK skipper benefited from valuable advice from the experienced Dhoni, indirectly implying the lack of similar support from his predecessor, Sharma.",
    "\"They got the hang of it and they have a man behind the stumps telling them what's working. The ball was slightly gripping and they got ahead of the game. Until Pathirana came, we were on course for the total,\" said Pandya.",
    "The Mumbai Indians skipper left experts baffled as he did not give full quota to Mohd Nabi, who gave away only 19 runs in three overs, while fellow spinner Shreyas Gopal got only one over in which he took one wicket for nine runs. Pandya took upon himself the responsibility to bowl the final over and was carted around by Dhoni.",
    "\"It was just about what was best at that point,\" said Pandya on whether they could have used a spinner with Shivam Dube at the crease, adding that it was more difficult to hit seamers on this wicket.",
    "\"We are now on the road for the next four games. If we are smart, we can get the goal we want,\" he added."
