    "(KRAKOW, Poland): On the morning of 16 April, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne\u2019s family informed me that he was in critical condition. In the quiet of the evening, I was heartbroken to learn that \u201cAri Aiya\u201d of Sarvodaya\u2014as I affectionately called him for more than half a century\u2014departed us peacefully.",
    "With a clear and sharp mind until his last breath, the 92-year-old soul lived for others with his quintessentially Buddhist way of life as a compassionate servant-leader. Undeniably, Ari Aiya drew equal inspiration from the Gandhian philosophy of non-violence. When he received the Hubert H. Humphrey International Humanitarian Award from the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School of Public Affairs in 1994, I hailed him as the \u201cGandhi of Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Ari Aiya was a mentor, a friend, and a guiding figure in my formative years in Sri Lanka. We will all surely miss this remarkable human being; however, his message of \u201cthe awakening of individual personality for human progress\u201d remains a living legacy for posterity. Former Secretary of State Mark Ritchie of Minnesota, a mutual friend, reminded me that \u201chumanity is less kind and less peaceful today with this loss\u2014more for the rest of us to do.\u201d",
    "Indeed, the visionary founder of the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement lived a peaceful life of simplicity that has been a source of inspiration for many. For him, Sarvodaya meant \u201cawakening of all\u201d through Shramadana: the voluntary \u201cgift of labour\u201d for the common good\u2014seeking to uplift the lives of outcaste villagers. The post-independent nation was, and still is, a land of 15,000 marginalised villages. It represents about 80% of the island\u2019s population, a group perennially ignored by the former masters of the colonial plantation economy.",
    "While teaching at Nalanda College in Colombo, Ari Aiya inspired a dedicated group of 40 students and 12 teachers for an \u201ceducational experiment\u201d focused on social change in 1958. This novelty endeavour laid the foundation for Sarvodaya, a social movement that quickly gained widespread popularity throughout the island.",
    "Ari Aiya was a fervent believer in the Buddhist and Gandhian principles of non-violence; however, he embraced all religious and cultural values in his evolving multilingual, multiracial, and multireligious society of Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and others. His secularised Sarvodaya teachings integrated these elements into a unifying force aimed at achieving ultimate liberation (Vimukthi in Buddhism). This was realised through villagers making collective decisions at \u201cfamily gatherings.\u201d",
    "Employing the Buddhist analysis of human suffering (Dukkha), Ari Aiya applied the secular principles of Shramadana. This path aimed for a progression from the individual awakening of personality (Purusodaya) to the awakening of the village (Gramodaya), the country (Deshodaya), and ultimately the world (Vishyodaya). His philosophy emphasised personal transformation as the starting point for uplifting each villager from poverty and achieving welfare for all.",
    "In her handbook for humanitarians and development practitioners, \u2018Stone Soup for the World: Life-Changing Stories of Everyday Heroes\u2019, Marianne Larned profiled the legendary Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne as an ordinary person with an extraordinary vision, conviction, and innovation. I was honoured to contribute to the chapter on \u201cAwakening,\u201d where I shared my first encounter with Ari Aiya and my experience of a Sarvodaya Shramadana \u201cfamily gathering\u201d in Polonnaruwa\u2014my birthplace and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
    "For me, the essence of Shramadana was the realisation that volunteering and the \u201cgift of labour\u201d deepen our understanding of interdependence and the impermanence of our life. Through the underlying conviction that \u201cwe build the road, and the road builds us,\u201d this awakening emphasised the reciprocal nature of contributing to human progress.",
    "This practicum had a lasting impact, influencing me beyond my formative years in Sri Lanka. Even while studying and working in the United States, I maintained contact with Ari Aiya and Sarvodaya. When the University of Minnesota published my manuscript, \u2018The Political Economy of Poverty Alleviation in Developing Countries\u2019 (1992), Prof. Vernon Ruttan\u2014a father of the Green Revolution\u2014highlighted the development paradox in Sri Lanka: despite having high life expectancy and literacy rates similar to Japan and South Korea, Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP per capita income was relatively low. This paradox also puzzled Nobel Laureate economist Amartya Sen.",
    "When I explained to Prof. Ruttan that Sarvodaya and Buddhism might offer an explanation for Sri Lanka\u2019s development paradox, he was intrigued. Emphasising the Buddhist values of education and health as essential for liberation from suffering, I suggested they fostered a focus on well-being within Sri Lankan culture. Fascinated by this connection, Prof. Ruttan visited Ari Aiya in Sri Lanka to study Sarvodaya in its village context. Subsequently, I engaged in a series of enlightening conversations with Prof. Ruttan and Ari Aiya.",
    "These conversations and explorations culminated in the University of Minnesota publishing my next book, \u2018Buddhist Equilibrium: The Theory of Middle Path for Sustainable Development\u2019 (1993). Following its publication, Ari Aiya later incorporated this framework in his \u201cSchumacher Lectures on Buddhist Economics.\u201d Interestingly, two decades earlier, the Sarvodaya model for holistic human development had also influenced British economist E.F. Schumacher\u2019s seminal work, \u2018Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as If People Mattered\u2019 (1973). Sarvodaya\u2019s focus on people-centred development\u2014accentuating a path from personal awakening to national progress\u2014predated the emphasis on similar concepts found in the UN Human Development Report and the World Happiness Report.",
    "Nonetheless, Ari Aiya was globally known as a visionary leader who uplifted the rural poor. He is Sri Lanka\u2019s most decorated citizen with over 100 international prizes that recognised his holistic development model, which highlights individual personality-awakening as a solution for human progress at large. His tributes included the Magsaysay Award (also known as the Nobel Prize of Asia) of the Philippines, the King Beaudoin Award of Belgium, the Niwano Peace Prize of Japan, the Gandhi Peace Prize of India, and the Humphrey International Humanitarian Award of the United States.",
    "Ari Aiya\u2019s influence and his Sarvodaya teachings extended far beyond the island-nation. For example, soon after the tragic 2004 tsunami, the United States channelled much of its humanitarian assistance through the Sarvodaya network of village centres. When the United States Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist and Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell visited Sri Lanka, they were impressed by the rapid transformation of these centres into effective tsunami relief hubs. Witnessing Sarvodaya\u2019s democratic \u201cfamily gathering\u201d model and overall operational efficiency, the senator met Ari Aiya, the \u201clittle, big man,\u201d and later described him as the \u201choly man\u201d of Sri Lanka.",
    "In her tribute to Ari Aiya upon his passing, United States Ambassador Julie Chung expressed the gratitude of the American people for Sarvodaya\u2019s enduring partnership. She recognised that Ari Aiya\u2019s Sarvodaya work helped \u201cto uplift the lives of countless Sri Lankans\u201d and continues to \u201cinspire generations to come.\u201d",
    "With remarkable foresight, Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike predicted the success of Ari Aiya\u2019s inaugural 1958 educational experiment in Kanatholuwa, the birthplace of Sarvodaya. The prime minister entrusted his wife Sirimavo Bandaranaike with delivering a letter to Ari Aiya. In it, he commended the Sarvodaya pioneer for uniting Nalanda College student and faculty volunteers to work alongside marginalised villagers in a shared effort towards upliftment.",
    "Building on previous examples of success, perhaps successive governments should have fully embraced Sarvodaya to address Sri Lanka\u2019s economic, social, moral, and spiritual challenges. Through the Sarvodaya philosophy, Ari Aiya has shown us the pivotal notion that the individual \u201cawakening of personality\u201d must precede broader societal change or the \u201cawakening of others.\u201d Thus, this reflects the immutable natural laws of our interdependence and impermanence that shape our individual and collective Samsaric journey both within this world and beyond.",
