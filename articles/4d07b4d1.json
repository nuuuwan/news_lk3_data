    "These outlets will offer an extensive range of CEAT tyres with attractive discounts, tyre care and technical expertise, as well as a combination of services such as wheel balancing and alignment, nitrogen and air pumps for tyre inflation, alloy wheels and automobile batteries. A distinctive feature of every CEAT SIS outlet is its own customer lounge.",
    "Part of a distribution channel expansion strategy by Sri Lanka\u2019s highest-selling tyre brand, the CEAT SIS concept is designed to drive brand premiumisation and enhance customer experience, and entails demarcating a dedicated area for CEAT branded tyres within existing multi-brand dealer premises.",
    "CEAT Kelani Holdings furnishes the customer lobby and reception areas of this private space to augment customer comfort. Additionally, the company invests in illuminated brand boards in-store and outside for enhanced brand visibility, roofing, glazing, lighting and furniture, as well as innovative product display racks to emphasise the tyre offerings available with the channel partner. Besides enhancing the visibility and positioning of the brand, this model is known to increase the channel partners\u2019 revenue.",

    "CEAT\u2019s emergence as the top brand in Sri Lanka\u2019s tyre sector is the result of substantial investments over several years that have seen not just exponential increases in volumes but expansion of the product range, the deployment of new technology and quantum improvements in quality. The company\u2019s new retail concepts are designed to ensure the customer experience keeps pace with the brand\u2019s growth."
