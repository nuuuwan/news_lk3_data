    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The government must use a recent Supreme Court verdict on Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis to recover \u201cstolen assets\u201d and redistribute them among the public, former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.",
    "In a statement to the media on Sunday November 19, Kumaratunga said the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict on who was responsible for \u201cbankruting\u201d Sri Lanka was a rare and special one.",
    "\u201cThe only question I have is, there are many other people connected to it who have not been named. But this is a very rare ruling in this country, and it is a great one,\u201d she said.",
    "Noting that the apex court hasn\u2019t sentenced the parties named in the verdict, Kumaratunga said the petitioners hadn\u2019t sought a penalty for the accused.",
    "\u201cBut citizens can go to court and seek punishment and compensation,\u201d she said, adding that millions of Sri Lankans who have had to go hungry as a result of the economic crisis can use the opportunity to get redress.",
    "The former president went further and said money allegedly stuffed in foreign bank accounts and offshore companies or invested in hotels and residences in Sri Lanka can also be found through police investigation, using the court\u2019s verdict.",
    "\u201cThe government can appropriate these assets, convert them to cash and absorb it to the Treasury or redistribute it among the people,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cThis is nothing new. The World Bank has a stolen assets unit which has mechanisms in place for finding such things. We can obtain their assistance.\u00a0 In the Philippines assets were recovered and brought back to their country, to a great extent,\u201d said Kumaratunga.",
    "\u201cThis can be done. I urge the government to take action on this immediately,\u201d she added.",
    "Meanwhile, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has said he does not accept the verdict holding him, two of his brothers and officials affiliated with their administration responsible for Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis.",
