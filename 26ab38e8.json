    "A tense situation prevailed when Industries State Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake visited the Sri Lanka State Phosphate Company in Eppawala for an inspection yesterday.",
    "The tense situation reportedly arose when an employee attempted to attack an Executive Officer in the presence of the State Minister after a group of employees tried to expose what they called fraud and corruption in the company.",
    "However, the situation was thwarted by the intervention of the Police.",
    "The employees alleged that the company had incurred a massive loss by importing a spare part to a grinding machine that the company did not need.",
    "The State Minister inquired as to why the relevant spare part was not replaced, despite the full amount being paid. He then summoned official who had reportedly placed the order.",
    "The Supplies Officer had then told the Minister that it was brought from a Chinese company and they had later found that it was different to the existing one, and the serial number was also different, hence it could not be used.",
    "He however said that he couldn\u2019t be held responsible for the purchase.",
    "Then the State Minister told Lanka Phosphate Chairman Sandhya Ambanwala to terminate the relevant official.",
    "But the concerned official had told the Minister that the decision to import the item had been taken by the Tender Board and not by him.",
    "The Supplies Officer later lodged a complaint with the Eppawala Police that he was assaulted by an employee in the presence of the State Minister.\u00a0(Darshana Sanjeewa Balasuriya)"
