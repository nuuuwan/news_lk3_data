  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a strategic move to uplift and empower Sri Lanka\u2019s next generation of IT professionals, the UK-headquartered College of Contract Management (CCM) is setting its sights on learners who need it most: school leavers with limited access to higher education. With a mission that puts practical skill development at the forefront, CCM is introducing industry-relevant courses aimed at equipping students with the tools necessary to thrive in a global tech-driven economy.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be special about us,\u201d says Elise de Carteret, a senior leader from CCM\u2019s UK head office, \u201cis that we\u2019re not going to focus solely on academic theory. We\u2019re actually going to teach learners the practical skills they can take directly into the workforce. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to give them an edge.\u201d",
    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review, she said that CCM has already operated in Sri Lanka for nearly a decade through its private limited back-office presence. Now, with this latest initiative, the institution is moving from operational support to direct educational delivery\u2014starting with courses in programming and IT.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll be teaching various coding languages such as JavaScript and PHP, de Carteret elaborated. \u201cThen learners will complete a capstone project that mimics what they\u2019d actually be asked to do in the IT industry. These languages form the core foundation for progressing into any sector of IT\u2014cybersecurity, AI, machine learning, data science\u2014you name it.\u201d",
    "The focus isn\u2019t just on skills. It\u2019s also about access. With over 55,000 Sri Lankan students passing the university entrance exams but failing to secure a placement, CCM sees a significant opportunity to fill a widening educational gap.",
    "\u201cThese students may not have the means to pursue private education, de Carteret said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel fair that they\u2019re being left behind. We want to offer them a path forward\u2014one that\u2019s practical, affordable, and empowering.\u201d",
    "Beyond the classroom, CCM brings its UK-level academic standards to Sri Lanka, leveraging expert-led instruction and real-world assignments. De Carteret, who heads up HR and operations at CCM, plays a critical role in lecturer recruitment.",
    "\u201cMy role involves sourcing experts who are not only qualified but passionate about passing on their knowledge. We want learners to be taught by people who have been in the field and understand what it takes to succeed, she noted.",
    "With a positive view of Sri Lanka\u2019s workforce and cultural ethos, de Carteret added:",
    "\u201cWe already have around 50 team members in our office here, and all of them are exceptional. They\u2019re hardworking and fully committed. That\u2019s why we want to give back to Sri Lanka. We believe this is the right place to start.\u201d",
    "When asked about the broader vision, de Carteret pointed to the newly energized focus by the Sri Lankan government on IT, AI, and digital transformation.",
    "\u201cYes, our director did a full review of the local context before expanding here. We\u2019re aware that the new government is pushing the tech sector, and we want to be a part of that growth. If demand is sufficient, we\u2019ll even consider moving into other disciplines in the future.\u201d",
    "She added: \u201cIt\u2019s always a lovely experience to be in Sri Lanka. Everyone\u2019s incredibly friendly, and I\u2019m personally very excited about launching this initiative. We\u2019re here to make a difference.\u201d",
