Working with S W R D Bandaranaike in the 1956-1959 period had given me the opportunity of appreciating the many-faceted character of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was a devoted mother to her three children, ran her very busy and sometimes even chaotic household with a firm hand and had developed an understanding with her husband which allowed him to engage in his political pursuits with minimum interference.

### Two Bhikkhunis тАУ one ancient, the other of the recent past

December to me is the month to celebrate women. I presume the reason is that I revere Sanghamitta Theri, daughter of Emperor Asoka, who on request of King Devanampiya Tissa (250 тАУ 210 BC) on behalf of the women in his court, came to Lanka. She brought a sapling from the Gaya Bo Tree under which Siddhartha Gautama solved the riddle of samsaric existence and found a solution. She also started the Bhikkhuni Order in this country; the request being made by Queen Anula, sister-in-law of King Devanampiya Tissa.

Theri SanghamittaтАЩs arrival in a then port in the Jaffna Peninsula now known as Jambakolapatuna and her being conducted in procession to Anuradhapura occurred in the month of December, hence our observance of Unduvap Poya this month along with Sanghamitta Day.

### RanilтАЩs ascent in the UNP to become PM after the Premadasa assassination

On September 21, 2024, Sri Lanka will hold (Note: this was written before the election) its ninth presidential election. Unlike all previous such polls, which were in effect two-way battles between the governing party and the main opposition party, this is a three-way contest between Wickremesinghe, Premadasa of the SJB and Dissanayake of the JVP тАУ the latter heading a coalition dubbed National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP).

But the election is taking place on a battleground largely of WickremesingheтАЩs making. The 21st Amendment he pushed through gave birth to an independent Election Commission. He also enacted a campaign finance law that enables the commission to decide the amounts candidates can spend and to enforce these limits. The commission is conducting this election with unprecedented even-handedness and applying long-ignored election laws тАУ including against WickremesingheтАЩs own campaign.

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-08 03:28:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) ┬╖ `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.

### An impusive visit to George Keyt nearly 40 years ago

A few Sundays ago (this article was written in July 1985) I travelled through the fertile lands of the Dumbara valley and passed through Kundasale, Arangala, Gammaduwa (with its Buddhist Temple of unique design) and Sirimalwatta, to Gunnepana.

The purpose was to see, in person, George Keyt, whose great artistic achievements and invaluable contribution to art in Sri Lanka were so beautifully presented recently in a telefilm Directed by Tissa Liyanasuriya with the script by Tissa Devendra. Up to the time of this TV program it was a hope that a chance meeting would materialize, but it became an urgent need after that.

The drive was tortuous, the roads being more like gullies than even cart tracks. But what bothered me more was a faint recollection of a conversation I cannot remember where, which left with me the impression that the artist does not welcome visitors. However, since the decision had been made I kept going stopping frequently for directions.

These were prescribed for short term use for certain skin conditions she said.

She pointed out that excessive usage of topical applications containing steroids of varying levels of strength could lower the skinтАЩs immunity leading to various infections.

тАЬHigh potency steroids shouldnтАЩt be applied to the face or sensitive areas like armpits. But people are applying them as they want. This can damage the skin and attract fungal and bacterial diseases.тАЭ

Various products suspected to contain steroids were being sold across social media apps recommending them for reducing dark colour, or pigmentation, in three days, the doctor said.

### South KoreaтАЩs President survives impeachment vote after his party boycotts

*2024-12-07 18:31:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104064/south-koreas-president-survives-impeachment-vote-after-his-party-boycotts) ┬╖ `en`

A South Korean legislative push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law fell through on Saturday after most lawmakers from his conservative governing party boycotted the vote.

The defeat of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for YoonтАЩs ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the presidentтАЩs impeachment.

YoonтАЩs martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative party, but it is also determined to oppose YoonтАЩs impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals.

Impeaching Yoon required support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties who brought the impeachment motion had 192 seats, but only three lawmakers from PPP participated in the vote. The motion was scrapped without ballot counting because the number of votes didnтАЩt reach 200.

### CEB slammed over proposal not to revise electricity tariffs

*2024-12-07 14:09:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104060/ceb-slammed-over-proposal-not-to-revise-electricity-tariffs) ┬╖ `en`

Numerous parties have voiced strong opposition to the Ceylon Electricity BoardтАЩs (CEB) recent proposal to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to maintain the existing electricity tariffs without any revision for the next six months.

Critics argue that authorities must justify why the public is not benefiting from the increased hydroelectric power generation, which has surged following heavy rainfall across the country.

Earlier this year, electricity tariffs were reduced twice under the policy of revising rates quarterlyтАФby 21.9% in March and 22.5% in July. Although another revision was due in October, it was postponed to December.

The PUCSL recently rejected a CEB proposal to reduce rates by 6% to 11%, asserting that a more significant reduction was possible given current conditions.

The CEBтАЩs latest proposal suggests no reductions for the next six months, citing that any possible adjustment would be as minimal as 1.02%.
