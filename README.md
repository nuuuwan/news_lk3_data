ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலை பிற்போடுவது முழு நாட்டிற்கும் நன்மை பயக்கும். அதிலும் குறிப்பாக தமிழர்களுக்கு நன்மையே.

இந்த ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலை பொறுத்த வரைக்கும் வேட்பாளர் எவரும் 50 வீதத்திற்கும் அதிகமான வாக்குகளை பெற முடியாத நிலைமை காணப்படுகிறது. அதனால் அவர்கள் சிறுபான்மையின மக்களின் வாக்குகளை பெற முனைப்பு காட்டுவார்கள்.

அதேநேரம் ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் எவரும் 50 வீதத்திற்கும் அதிகமான வாக்குகளை பெறாத நிலைமை ஏற்படும் போது நாட்டில் அரசியல் ஸ்திரத்தன்மை இல்லாமல் போகும்.

ஏற்கனேவே நாட்டில் பொருளாதார நெருக்கடிகள் காணப்படுகிறது. அந்நிலையில் அரசியல் ஸ்திரத்தன்மை இல்லாது போனால் நாடும் மிக மோசமான பொருளாதார பின்னடைவுகளை சந்திக்க நேரிடும்.

அத்துடன், தேர்தலுக்காக பெருமளவான நிதிகள் செலவழிக்கப்பட வேண்டிய நிலைமையும் ஏற்படும். அதுவும் நாட்டின் பொருளாதாரத்தை பாதிக்கும்.

### A Machiavellian exercise?

*2024-07-19 23:25:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-Machiavellian-exercise/4-764497) · `en`

Why is the Government now, nine years later, without any issue having been raised by the Supreme Court or by any other court or tribunal, or in Parliament, or in any other forum, seeking to amend the Constitution for the sole purpose of replacing the words “six years” in Article 83 with the words “five years”?

In the 16th century, the Florentine diplomat Niccolo Machiavelli, in his book “The Prince”, outlined ruthless ways to achieve and retain political power. The events of the past two weeks lead one to wonder whether attempts are now being made to give practical effect to some of those techniques in this country.

That uprising exposed at last the vacuity of SBM as a constructive national ideology and signalled the need for a model of governance that would deliver those ideals

The 2022 Aragalaya was a landmark event in Sri Lankan politics. It was the harbinger for a new era in which the old political culture and governance with all its accoutrement would be thrown out and a new system of governance free of all past evils would be put in place. It was therefore an opportunity for the minorities who had suffered continually and immensely in the previous era to welcome this occasion. Instead, and shockingly, they are caught in a quandary and appear to have become saboteurs of the new and guardians of the old era.
