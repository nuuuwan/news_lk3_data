    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Five civil society groups are calling for government action to investigate mass graves which they say contain the remains of so-called \u201cdisappeared\u201d in various civil conflicts on the island.",
    "In a press release issued on June 22, the groups insisted that \u201cif the Sri Lankan government is serious about dealing with the past it must commit to have international observers at all exhumations of mass graves.\u201d",
    "The festering issue of the disappeared has not been addressed in any systematic way by successive governments despite frequent promises.",
    "The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) created by the Yahapalanaya government has proved to be a disappointment.",
    "Brito Fernando of the Families of the Disappeared says that after three decades and twenty attempted exhumations, only a handful of bodies have ever been identified and returned to families.",
    "\u201cWe all know tens of thousands of bodies lie in shallow graves all over the island, so we can\u2019t describe this dismal rate of progress as bad luck \u2013 it\u2019s a clear lack of political will,\u201d he added.",
    "The five organisations released a detailed report on the past investigations into mass graves. It meticulously reveals the government\u2019s \u201csystematic interference with investigations\u201d a statement issued by the five organisations said.",
    "A 30-minute documentary film, \u201cIn Plain Sight \u2013 Searching for Truth Behind Sri Lanka\u2019s Mass Graves\u201d, was also screened at the event, illustrating how long and hard the families of the disappeared have struggled for the truth. The documentary explores the connection between disappearances and mass graves in Sri Lanka by focusing on different narratives, including those of affected families and loved ones, the press release said.",
    "Investigations into a mass grave found near the Matale hospital prompted the joint report.",
    "The remains exhumed at that location in 2013 are believed to be of the hundreds of people who went missing during the late 1980s.",
    "\u201cMatale was the scene of hundreds of disappearances in 1989 when the former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the district military coordinator of the area; he was later named as an alleged suspect by a Presidential Commission of Inquiry\u201d the press release said.",
    "It added that a group of UN experts \u201cwrote to the Government of Sri Lanka this year to ask what it had done to investigate and hold Gotabaya Rajapaksa and other alleged perpetrators accountable but there was no reply.\u201d",
    "Yasmin Sooka, executive director of the International Truth and Justice Project in South Africa was quoted in the release as saying that this \u201cshows that documenting the crimes, collecting the evidence and preserving it is just the first step \u2013 thirty years later we still find ourselves fighting for truth and justice; without which the guarantee of non-recurrence remains elusive.\u201d",
    "\u201cAccountability is not an optional exercise \u2013 it\u2019s essential for building a future for all Sri Lankans,\u201d she added.",
    "The report examines the way investigations throughout the island have been stymied whether the mass graves are in the south or the north and east.",
    "Magistrates and forensic experts have been transferred abruptly, police have delayed carrying out judicial orders, families\u2019 lawyers have been denied access to sites, no effort has been made to find living witnesses, no ante mortem data has been collected, the Attorney General\u2019s Office has dropped the case, and, in the very rare instances where someone was convicted, they were then pardoned, the report alleged.",
    "Though a new inquest law and standard operating procedures have been drafted, they have not been made public, nor have the families been consulted.",
    "\u201cThere is total lack of political will with regard to mass graves investigations and enforced disappearance in Sri Lanka,\u201d said K.S. Ratnavale, executive director of the Centre for Human Rights and Development who has represented families in mass grave cases.",
    "\u201cAdded to this, the Attorney General\u2019s Department views such mass grave investigations as part of ordinary criminal proceedings and is hostile to victim families.",
    "This was evident in the Mannar mass graves investigations. While in Matale the magistrate who held an impartial inquiry was transferred with immediate effect. Thus, political interference is rampant in order to protect the interests of the Sri Lankan military and their political masters,\u201d he added.",
    "In Mannar, 318 bodies (including 28 children) were exhumed in 2018. Among the objects that were recovered were metal bindings which had been used to tie legs together.",
    "In Matale, some of the skeletal remains reportedly had bullet holes, and others were found to have their hands tied behind their back. There too, objects were found that a forensic archaeologist dated to the late 1980s.",
    "Nevertheless, the Department of Archaeology stated that the Mannar site was a normal cemetery and a Commission set up by then President Mahinda Rajapaksa concluded the Matale grave dated from the 1950s.",
    "\u201cWe are good at burying in this country but not at unearthing the truth,\u201d says Bashana Abeywardane of Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka which co-authored the report.",
    "\u201cWe need to collect ante-mortem data from the families of the disappeared and meticulously locate the hundreds, if not thousands, of remaining mass graves with the help of international experts. Only then should excavations start\u201d he added."
