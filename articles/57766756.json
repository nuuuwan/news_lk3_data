    "Writes to S. Shritharan requesting him to take over leadership responsibilities",
    "However, an injunction order against Shritharan continues barring him from functioning as ITAK leader",
    "ITAK General Secretary P. Sathiyalingam also says he has not received any formal communique from Senathiraja on resignation",
    "Mavai Senathiraja, who has served as the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) for nearly a decade, officially announced his resignation this week.",
    "In a letter addressed to Former Jaffna District Parliamentarian S. Shritharan on 7 October 2024, Senathiraja confirmed that he would be stepping down from the leadership role and urged Shritharan to take over as the party\u2019s leader.",
    "Senathiraja acknowledged that Shritharan had already been elected as the party leader during ITAK\u2019s 17th National Convention held in January 2024. However, despite winning the leadership race, Shritharan had not yet assumed the position due to legal restrictions.",
    "In his resignation letter to Shritharan, Senathiraja wrote: \u201cI have told you many times to accept the responsibility and act as the leader. I hereby inform you that I have decided to resign from the post of President of ITAK with effect from 7 October 2024.\u201d He urged Shritharan to now officially assume the leadership role and fulfil the duties of the party\u2019s President.",
    "Shritharan secured 184 votes in the January election, defeating his rival, fellow Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran, who garnered 134 votes. Shritharan\u2019s victory was anticipated, as he enjoys strong support in Jaffna, where he is based, unlike Sumanthiran.",
    "The 55-year-old, who hails from Neduntheevu in Jaffna, has deep roots in the region. An alumnus of Jaffna Hindu College and the University of Jaffna, Shritharan was a teacher before transitioning to a career in politics. His family ties also connect him to the late senior LTTE Commander Velayuthapillai Baheerathakuar, known by his nom de guerre \u2018Theepan,\u2019 as Shritharan is married to his sister.",
    "Despite his victory, Shritharan has been unable to take on the leadership position due to two enjoining orders issued by Trincomalee District Judge Manickavasagam Ganesharajah on 15 February 2024 preventing him and other office bearers from functioning in their positions. These legal restrictions have prevented Shritharan from officially assuming office, forcing Senathiraja to continue serving as ITAK\u2019s interim leader.",
    "While Senathiraja has now stepped down, it remains unclear how Shritharan can take over the leadership role as the injunction order against him continues. The legal proceedings regarding the enjoining orders must be resolved before Shritharan can assume full responsibilities as the ITAK leader.",
    "Meanwhile, ITAK General Secretary P. Sathiyalingam said he has not received any formal communique from Senathiraja resigning from the party post."
