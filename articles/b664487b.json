    "COLOMBO (News 1st): National People\u2019s Power MP Wasantha Pushpakumara says that the opposition is in a state of panic due to the government\u2019s successful implementation of its programs.MP Pushpakumara iterated that the government\u2019s programs, particularly the government's initiative titled \u201cA Thriving Nation, A Beautiful Life\u201d, are implemented effectively and have been receiving strong public support, as citizens see the country progressing and laws being properly enforced.He added that opposition groups are therefore unsettled and are in a state of panic, attempting to create narratives through the media, but their efforts are unlikely to sway public opinion due to the government\u2019s success.MP Pushpakumara also highlighted the government\u2019s focus on drug prevention and legal action against unlawful activities, stressing that these measures are for the country\u2019s benefit, not political gain.\u00a0MP Wasantha Pushpakumara reiterated that despite opposition's attempts to raise concerns, the programs continue to achieve tangible results."
