  "original_body_lines": [
    "Axiata Digital Labs (ADL), Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (Indosat or IOH), XL Axiata, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced the SinergiAPI Portal, the first API portal in Indonesia based upon GSMA\u2019s Open Gateway initiative which aims to empower developers and enterprises by offering universal access to network operator APIs. GSMA Open Gateway APIs are defined, developed, and published in CAMARA, the open-source project driven by the Linux Foundation.",
    "In conjunction with the introduction of the API portal, the SinergiAPI Early Adopter Event was recently held in Jakarta, to enable developers and enterprises in Indonesia to register their interest, integrate and test their applications and services in a controlled environment. This event marks a significant milestone in providing developers and enterprises in Indonesia with universal access to a comprehensive set of telco APIs from Indosat and XL Axiata through the SinergiAPI Portal. With SinergiAPI Portal, developers, and enterprises will be able to consume APIs and access network resources seamlessly; enrich and differentiate their innovations in generating new revenue streams and expand market reach locally and globally.",
    "The SinergiAPI Portal currently offers developers and enterprises access to three Open Gateway APIs from Indosat and XL Axiata: SIM Swap, Device Location Verification, and Carrier Billing Check-Out. The SIM Swap API plays a pivotal role in preventing identity theft and fraud through real-time detection and prevention of SIM card-related incidents. The Device Location Verification API empowers organizations to verify the location of user devices in offering personalized services and aiding efforts towards fraud prevention, while the Carrier Billing Check-Out API enables subscribers to conveniently charge online purchases to their phone balance. An additional set of APIs are planned for release in 2024 based upon feedback from the Early Adopter Event and the needs of developers and enterprises across Indonesia.",
