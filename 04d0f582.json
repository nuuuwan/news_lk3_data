    "\u201cA smuggler is the only honest thief, because he steals from the Government.\u201d",
    "Parliamentarian Ali Sabri Raheem of the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), a breakaway party from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), representing the constituency of Puttalam, was caught red-handed a couple of weeks ago, rushing to smuggle in 3.5 kg of gold and dozens of hand phones from Dubai, where he is said to have business interests, without declaring them to the customs authorities. He had used his VIP status \u2013 why should MPs have VIP status is beyond the bounds of democratic governance \u2013 to accomplish his golden adventure.",
    "It came to light subsequently that this business politician had travelled six times since March this year to the same destination, and had taken off again for the seventh time, even after being caught. It is not known whether his baggage was checked on previous occasions. In this instance it is said to be a tip-off from someone or a source that alerted the customs. Perhaps this time that gold held so much more glitter so as to catch an officer\u2019s eye.",
    "What is more shocking in this episode is that he had got away from the offence paying a reduced fine of Rs. 7.5 million instead of the due sum of Rs. 22.5 million according to the law. Who ordered this reduction and why, is a mystery. However, the incident reveals a lot about how the system operates in Sri Lanka. The Minister concerned claims the fine was the highest ever imposed. The issue is not whether it was the highest or the lowest, but whether the rule of law was observed to the full. It is Ministerial discretion that allows space for corruption of this nature.",
    "The President who was in Japan at the time is reported to have ordered the immediate installation of scanning devices in the VIP lounge as well. Again, the question arises whether the culprits that the devices capture would face the full brunt of the law. Politics tend to intervene too much on these matters.",
    "Immediately after being nabbed by customs officers, the said parliamentarian had contacted Government higher ups including the President\u2019s office and appealed for intervention to get him and the goods released. He may have thought his record of support for the ruling mob would work in his favour. One should remember he was one of those who voted for the 20th Amendment to the Constitution brought by the Rajapaksa regime in 2020, and was rumoured then to be among a few other Muslim parliamentarians who voted for that Bill on the promise of cash or Cabinet positions. Despite that, the same mob let him down this time. In retaliation, the said MP voted against the Government when the Bill to remove the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission was introduced. It now transpires that opposition parties want this MP removed from the legislature permanently.",
    "Parliamentarians, especially Cabinet Ministers, using VIP privileges to bring in taxable goods including luxury cars, and walking away without declaring them to customs or paying the lawful tariffs is nothing new in this country. At times they do it on behalf of their family, business friends or party supporters. So, why was this particular MP, a Muslim, caught but fined leniently and why is the opposition baying for his removal from the legislature? These are things to be pondered given the political environment that is edging towards a Presidential Election. It is the politics behind this event and the silence of the two Muslim parties and the Muslim community\u2019s so-called apex religious body, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) that raise serious concerns.",
    "In his effort to canvas the nation\u2019s support the President is embarking on the very sensitive issue of ethnic reconciliation. It is in that context that the politics behind the gold smuggling incident of a Muslim parliamentarian receives added focus. Historically, Muslims are politically identified with RW\u2019s UNP even though the SLMC and the ACMC did make inroads into that identity during General Elections. In the forthcoming Presidential Election Muslim votes would be crucial to RW. By not intervening to save the MP concerned RW has shown that he does not tolerate corruption, which the IMF insists on being eradicated. On the other hand, the leniency shown by the reduced fine should be considered as a gesture to the Muslims to prove that he is still a friend of that community",
    "President RW having achieved a modicum of financial stability with the rupee appreciating against US$ and prices of some consumer items reduced as a result, both of which may not last long, obviously wants to capitalise on that window of opportunity and seek a fresh mandate from the people. CBSL\u2019s slashing of interest rate by 250 basis points adds to this optimism. Yet, RW knows well that the promised economic recovery is not going to happen soon without the people having to bear further burdens. The Rupee appreciation is already hurting the country\u2019s export sector and inflation is still high. CBSL\u2019s recommendation to relax import restrictions without the exports showing a robust growth may add to inflationary pressure. Unless the whole nation is prepared to go through the IMF agenda in full, economic recovery is a fair distance away. This explains the top-ranking IMF staff visiting the country in succession and engaging in discussions with the opposition parties as well, to invite their cooperation. The IMF\u2019s Deputy Managing Director is the latest among the visitors. The IMF would wish to make Sri Lanka a successful showcase. RW\u2019s address to the nation on Friday reflects this situation.",

The silence of the two Muslim parties and the ACJU on this shameful incident endorses their acceptance of the President\u2019s dilemma. But that is not the case with those who want to oust this MP from Parliament permanently.",
    "RW\u2019s attempt at reconciliation will certainly inject fresh blood into the Sinhala Buddhist ultra-nationalist campaign. While all opposition parties except the NPP, bereft of any substantially different economic program to offer as an alternative to the IMF agenda, are promoting in desperation the threat to democracy as the theme of a counter campaign to defeat RW, the ultranationalists within and outside those parties are preparing to raise the historic fear of threat to Sinhala Buddhist majoritarianism, if RW was allowed to go ahead with his reconciliation plan. The SLPP, currently in bed with RW, is also not alien to Buddhist ultranationalism. Its 2020 election victory and that of its former President GR were fought on that card with Muslims portrayed as the source of that threat after the Tamils.",
    "The gold smuggling saga and the agitation to kick out that Muslim MP show signs of preparation to restart that dirty campaign. The recent controversy over Pastor Jerome Fernando, the remanding of stand-up comedian Natasha Edirisooriya for mocking religions, and the recent arrests of a couple of Madrasa staff from Puttalam in relation to the Easter bombing, which, according to a Muslim political leader seems to be a precursor to re-arrest Hejaaz Hizbullah, provide more ammunition to that campaign.",
    "The Anti-Terrorism Act, which is now put on the back-burner, would soon be reintroduced to Parliament and passed to strengthen RW\u2019s hands.",
