    "Accordingly, the suspect, identified as a 55-year-old resident of Kandana, was arrested today when she was summoned to the SLBFE in relation to several complaints received against her.",
    "It was later revealed that the suspect in question was previously arrested by the SLBFE for a similar offence, and was later released on bail by the Kalutara Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "She is, however, due to appear before the Wattala Magistrate\u2019s Court in connection with today\u2019s arrest.",
