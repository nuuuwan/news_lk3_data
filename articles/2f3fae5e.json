    "The U.S. State Department is set to roll out a pilot program that may require foreign nationals seeking business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to 15,000 U.S. dollars to enter the United States, according to a preview of a bond notice posted on the Federal Register website on Monday.",
    "Under the 12-month \u201cvisa bond pilot program,\u201d consular officers could require certain business and tourist visa applicants to post guarantee bonds of 5,000 U.S. dollars, 10,000 dollars or 15,000 dollars, according to the notice set to be officially published on Tuesday.",
    "The program will take effect 15 days after the notice is officially published.",
    "The bonds may be required for travelers from countries that the State Department identifies as having high rates of visa overstays, or deficient screening and vetting information, said the notice.",
    "The notice did not name the countries affected, but said the list will be released online at least 15 days before it takes effect.",
    "The proposal comes as the Trump administration continues to tighten visa requirements. Last week, the State Department announced that many visa renewal applicants would have to submit to an additional in-person interview, which was not required in the past."
