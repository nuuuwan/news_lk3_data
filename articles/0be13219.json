    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The arrest of Chinese, Indian and Thai nationals in multiple locations who were apparently targeting financial systems and banks in third countries have left authorities wondering whether Sri Lanka is becoming a cyber crimes hub.",
    "\u201cWe have to see if Sri Lanka is a cyber crimes hub,\u201d Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters, \u201cand whether our financial system is being affected by this.\u201d",
    "The Police have arrested over 200 foreign nationals, mainly Chinese, who were housed in several locations, including Kandy, Avissawella, Rajigiriya, and Negombo.",
    "\u201cThey had booked 72 rooms in a hotel in Kandy where these people had access to pool and kitchen facilities,\u201d Police Spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said.",
    "Scammers come to the Indian Ocean island on tourist visas, Thalduwa said.",
    "One reason Sri Lanka could be an attractive destination for cyber scamming hubs, he said, was the easy access to housing, or lodging. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to get houses here.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen renting out a property to foreigners, pay attention to what it will be used for,\u201d he said, adding that most property owners are well aware of what\u2019s going on. \u201cThat\u2019s the sad part.\u201d",
    "Another reason Sri Lanka was an attractive destination for scammers could be its people, Thalduwa said.",
    "\u201cIt could be a sociological reason; many groups in Sri Lanka are easily enticed by messages, and are gullible.\u201d",
    "\u201cPeople in economic difficulties can be enticed into earning quick money.\u201d",
    "After a foreign exchange crisis in 2022, many Sri Lankans went abroad to make money, with some falling prey to trafficking. A group of Sri Lankans are currently trapped in a cyber crime camp in Myanmar.",
    "China says supporting Sri Lanka crackdown on cyber rackets involving nationals",
    "Sri Lanka is also trying to attract more tourists since the economic crisis. (Colombo/Oct16/2024)"
