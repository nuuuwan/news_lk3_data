    "Asks CID to probe the allegedly false news reports and reveal info",
    "Threatens to take legal action against those disseminating fake news",
    "Customs claims Abeywardena did not extern undue pressure and merely appealed decision",
    "United National Party (UNP) MP Vajira Abeywardena yesterday lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the allegedly false reports being disseminated on social media relating to his involvement in the release of several items of gold jewellery confiscated by the Sri Lanka Customs.",
    "The complaint was filed by the Minister\u2019s Media Secretary on behalf of the senior United National Party (UNP) politician. The Minister has requested the CID to commence an investigation into the reports and reveal their findings. He has also threatened to take legal action against those who disseminated the allegedly false news.",
    "The reports that have distressed Abeywardena featured a communique by the Director General of Customs P.B.S.C Nonis relating to Customs Case No: BIA/Case/011/2023 and Appeal No: Cus/App/11/2023.",
    "The case in question involved a female who had arrived in the country in February. She was intercepted by Sri Lanka Customs Officials after it was found she had six gold bangles and two gold chains, with an estimated value of over Rs.15 million in her possession. Following the Customs inquiry, it was determined that the female had unlawfully brought these goods into the country. As a result, the goods were ordered to be forfeited, and a fine of Rs.100,000 was imposed.",
    "In the communique signed by Nonis, it was noted that the former Minister of Internal Affairs\u00a0 Vajira Abeywardena had filed an appeal against the inquiry order in the mentioned customs case.",
    "It also featured an order by Nonis to release the gold jewellery on recovery of applicable taxes that prevailed at the time of the seizure. This communique gave rise to accusations against Abeywardena for pressuring and influencing the Sri Lanka Customs to release the seized gold.",
    "However, the Sri Lanka Customs has since denied the MP had attempted to exert any pressure on the agency to release the gold. Instead, Sri Lanka Customs Spokesman Sudattha Silva responding to the media said any person can either directly or indirectly submit an appeal against the confiscation of any goods.",
    "Silva explained that the MP's appeal had been duly submitted following the accepted procedure and subsequently presented to the Customs Appeals Committee. The committee, after careful consideration, recommended that the goods be returned to their rightful owner.",
    "The spokesperson further emphasised that any individual has the right to file an appeal with the Director of Customs if they believe that the decision made during a customs investigation is unjust. He highlighted the existence of a proper due process that allows for the recovery of seized or confiscated goods in such cases."
