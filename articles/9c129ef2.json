  "original_title": "US designates Pakistani group\u2019s offshoot as \u2018terrorist\u2019 organization over Kashmir attack",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The U.S. government designated The Resistance Front, considered an offshoot of the Pakistani extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d over the April 22 Islamist militant attack in India-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday.",
    "The Resistance Front, also known as Kashmir Resistance, initially took responsibility for the attack in Pahalgam before denying it days later.",
    "Lashkar-e-Taiba, listed as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d by the United States, is an Islamist group accused of plotting attacks in India and in the West, including the three-day deadly assault on Mumbai in November 2008.",
    "TRF\u2019s designation by Washington as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d and \u201cspecially designated global terrorist\u201d enforced President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201dcall for justice for the Pahalgam attack,\u201d Rubio said in a statement.",
    "Rubio called TRF, which emerged in 2019, a \u201cfront and proxy\u201d for Lashkar-e-Taiba. It is considered an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a Delhi-based think tank.",
    "India said it appreciated the move, with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar calling it a \u201cstrong affirmation of India-US counter terrorism co-operation,\u201d in a post on X.",
    "The April attack sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed Asian neighbors India and Pakistan in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.",
    "Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for Foreign Policy magazine, said in designating TRF, \u201cWashington is flagging its concern about the terrorist attack that provoked the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and siding with New Delhi\u2019s view that the group is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba.\u201d",
    "He added: \u201cThis can be a shot in the arm for a U.S.-India relationship looking to rebound after a few tough months.\u201d",
    "On May 7, Indian jets bombed sites across the border that New Delhi described as \u201cterrorist infrastructure,\u201d setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones, and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10.",
    "The ceasefire was first announced by Trump on social media after Washington held talks with both sides, but India has differed with Trump\u2019s claims that it resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.",
    "India\u2019s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.",
    "India is an increasingly important U.S. partner in Washington\u2019s effort to counter China\u2019s rising influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a U.S. ally.",
    "Both Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full while ruling only parts of the Himalayan territory, over which they have also fought wars."
