    "The lives of school going children these days is so far removed from mine that kids of today may almost be living on another planet. Customs and attitudes today are weird. I watched with open mouthed amazement as granddaughter KitKat got ready for school.",
    "First, she put her swimsuit into her school bag. This was followed by a slightly damp towel plus an extra shirt. A board game and a cassette were flung in after all this.",
    "\u201cHaven\u2019t you forgotten something?\u201d I ask somewhat bewildered by the contents.",
    "\u201cOh yes,\u201d she added her Tuck Shop pocket money. \u201cNothing else?\u201d I inquired silkily.",
    "KitKat distrusts politeness from me. She is more comfortable with a yell.",
    "\u201cA school text perhaps? An exercise book or two. You DO intend to do some writing in school don\u2019t you?\u201d",
    "Now let\u2019s take my day at Bishop\u2019s far removed from the present. One never forgets the routine and discipline of parents half a century ago as opposed to the apparent laxity of today.",
    "We were woken at 5 a.m. Bags were packed the previous night with parents reminding us of the necessary chore every five minutes.",
    "The answer was always yes. We dared give no other. And what went into this school bag? Only school related stuff of course. Parents checked. The parental grapevine was abuzz with the latest news that Lady ChatterIay\u2019s Lover had been found in a grade 11 school bag. It was rumoured that Sister Gabrielle, our tall and gracious Principal, had looked at the novel and had to be revived with smelling salts. Bishop\u2019s was an Anglican school but a few Anglican nuns were always around to be shocked by modernity.",
    "On the dot of 6.30 a.m. if Father was in Sri Lanka in between lecture tours, he personally saw me off on my bike, from the back verandah. Su, my younger sister, was perched atop our own rickshaw parked alongside the car in the garage. Between puller Murthy and Su, was a running battle. Father knew this.",
    "\u201cNow, not a WORD to Murthy except a polite one,\u201d he would caution sternly. Su tossed her pretty head. She enjoyed the rickshaw ride with two or three boys cycling alongside making appreciative comments. Murthy did not approve of silly romance. He raced from Rosmead Place to St Bridget\u2019s at a speed Roger Bannister might have envied. Su fumed. It was just up one road and down the other after all.",
    "Parents did not have cars on the ready to drop us. Many of us cycled \u2013 especially those who lived within a hoo gana distance from the school.",
    "My Father did not like the thought of the car getting wet and remaining wet the whole day. He had no problem with me getting wet so the answer was predictable.",
    "Traffic was at a minimum. \u2018Making a dash\u2019 for anything was extremely easy. Besides which, one could always make use of a slightly damp look.",
    "\u201cMiss I got wet coming to school,\u201d we would tell our Form teachers. A realistic little cough further enforced the idea that we were sickening for colds.",
    "\u201cRun to the sick room right now dear,\u201d said a concerned mistress. She didn\u2019t want us breathing germs all over the class for the next few days. Properly executed that visit to the sickroom could be dragged out to cover two periods.",
    "Then there was the \u2018bag search\u2019. Unless they were School Prefects, girls were not considered particularly trustworthy. What am I saying. They were considered totally untrustworthy by every member of the school staff. Ergo, bags were searched once a week for \u2018undesirable fiction.\u2019",
    "Of course, we read undesirable fiction but we had the sense not to leave these exciting tomes lying round in our school bags. There were other things \u2013 too sacred to even mention, which we tucked into our bras and discussed with bated breath. These were romantic missives which class beauties like Chereen received regularly and were delivered by help karayas like myself with no boyfriend of my own.",
    "\u201cHow did you stand it Achchi? Nothing happened in your time.\u201d Ah but that\u2019s what she thinks. We certainly had our moments.",
