### Cabinet bond to remove the vet line of red Chinese

Here's a summary in 200 characters:



Sri Lankan Cabinet proposes removing VAT on red sugar, classifying it as essential. White sugar imports remain exempt. Brown sugar faces higher taxes. Price difference: red sugar (Rs. 300/kg) vs white sugar (market price).

üü©

Sunil Handunnetti, Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship, said in Parliament today that the Cabinet paper will be submitted next week for the removal of the Vat Tax on the Red Srine.

The Minister said that the VAT is not taxed for the white cinnated imported from outside Sri Lanka and that the brown sugar produced in Sri Lanka is 18% vot and 2.5% tax.

The Minister said that when the factory was released, a kilo of red sugar was 300 rupees and a kilogram of white sugar in the market.

Sunil Handunnetti said that the red sugar is classified as an essential substance and that the white sugar brought from outside Sri Lanka is an essential commodity.

### Kerala cannabis worth over Rs. 18 mln found adrift off Delft

*2024-12-06 16:49:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104046/kerala-cannabis-worth-over-rs-18-mln-found-adrift-off-delft) ¬∑ `en`

The Sri Lanka Navy has seized approximately 45.5 kg of Kerala cannabis found adrift in the waters during a special operation conducted in the sea area near Delft Island, Jaffna.

The operation was carried out by SLNS Wasabha of the Northern Naval Command, deploying an Inshore Patrol Craft, last night (05).

During the operation, naval personnel discovered two suspicious polythene sacks drifting in the Delft sea area. Upon inspection, the sacks were found to contain approximately 45.5 kg of Kerala cannabis packed into 20 parcels, the Navy said.

It is suspected that smugglers may have abandoned the consignment of Kerala cannabis due to the Navy‚Äôs persistent operations, which likely hindered their efforts to bring the contraband ashore, the Sri Lanka Navy said.

The gross street value of the seized Kerala cannabis is estimated to be over Rs. 18 million.

*2024-12-06 16:46:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-asia-asset-finance-to-raise-rs2bn-in-debentures-118488/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs Asia Asset Finance said it plans to raise up to 2 billion rupees through an issue of 20 million debentures at 100 rupees each.

The finance company said it will initially issue 10 million listed, rated, unsecured, senior, redeemable, 3-year (2024/2027) and 5-year (2024/2029) debentures to raise 1 billion rupees.

‚ÄúWith an option to issue up to a further 10 million of the said debentures in the event of an oversubscription of the initial tranche to raise up to a maximum of Sri Lankan rupees two billion,‚Äù the bank said in a stock exchange filing.

The Colombo Stock Exchange has approved the listing of the debt securities in principle.

The Supreme Court has issued an interim injunction order preventing the implementation of a Gazette notification issued by the previous government to increase the¬† annual fee for liquor licenses.

The three-judge bench, comprising Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe, and Priyantha Fernando, issued this order while granting leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition filed by the Sri Lanka Liquor Licensees‚Äô Association.

The petition, which names the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and several others as respondents, argues that increasing the annual fee to Rs. 20 million, stipulated in the 2024/1 gazette notification, causes severe injustice to license holders and constitutes a violation of their fundamental rights.

The petitioners requested the court to issue a directive to relevant authorities to revert to the fee structure back to the one outlined in the 2017 Gazette notification.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Industries Minister Sunil Handunetti said cabinet approval will be sought to lift value added tax from brown sugar made at Lanka Sugar, a state enterprise made from firms including once-listed Pelwatte Sugar, expropriated during a Rajapaksa regime in 2011.

Unsold stocks of sugar are stuck at Pelwatte and Sevenagala plants of Lanka Sugar, Moneragala legislator, R M Jayawardhana told parliament.

Sri Lanka is charging 18 percent value added tax from brown sugar made at Lanka Sugar, but imported white sugar is not subjected to VAT, Industries Minister Handunetti said.

Brown Sugar made at the SOE is also charged a 2.5 percent social security levy, he said.

‚ÄúAs a result, brown sugar costs about 300 rupees a kilo when it comes out of the factory, compared to 220 rupees for imported white sugar,‚Äù Minister Handunetti said.

‚ÄúIf we are to get rid of the stocks we definitely require a tax concession.  I am planning to present a proposal to cabinet to lift VAT from brown sugar.‚Äù
