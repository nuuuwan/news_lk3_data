ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka launched an online system to streamline the passport issuance on Wednesday (06), but physical appointments will be available only from December first week due to the high number of tokens already given, government officials said.

Though the government has urged people not to rush for passports unless urgent, government officials say thousands have been waiting in the queue from early morning hours even though majority of them are not going on a foreign visit in the near future.

The new online process will be launched to reduce the queues.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets тАУ smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

### Rethinking Central Bank independence in Sri LankaтАЩs development journey

Although an independent CBSL is intended to operate free from political interference, it remains heavily influenced by IMF directives, fostering dependency on IMF guidance

As Sri Lanka prepares for a new government post-14 November, it must carefully evaluate the extent of external influence on its economic policy. A critical question is whether Sri Lanka has already ceded too much control over its monetary and fiscal policy decisions to outside actors. Aligning national development goals of the new government will likely require greater coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, ensuring they operate in tandem to achieve shared objectives. The CBSL should retain the flexibility for strategic interventions that foster growth, development, and social welfare when needed

One of the greatest challenges for commercial leaders is balancing immediate needs with long-term growth strategies

Commercial leaders today are tasked with steering their organisations through increasingly unpredictable markets. Maintaining strategic focus while being agile is crucial for weathering sudden disruptions. Leaders must balance the long-term vision with the need to adapt swiftly to unforeseen challenges, requiring a deep understanding of market factors like consumer behaviour, competitor activity, and regulatory shifts. Regular reassessment of strategic objectives is key, and when market conditions change, quick pivots are critical.

Agility doesnтАЩt mean losing sight of the long-term strategy; it enhances execution by empowering teams to make informed, real-time decisions. Scenario planning is essential for staying aligned with core goals while adjusting to evolving conditions. This blend of focus and agility helps organisations remain proactive and adaptable.

Now, some students are admitted to universities directly from the University Grant Commission and they are not allowed to segue into any other stream of leaning. In some cases, they cannot even take classes in another subject. In addition, there are departments in our faculties looking to seize the first opportunity to break away and establish their own faculties isolating further in their own expertise.
