    "Several tributes have already appeared in the media regarding Bradman. This subtitle is taken from an upcoming book by Carolyn Dewar, Scott Keller, Vikram (Vik) Malhotra and Kurt Strovink. Besides being the Secretary to no less than nine Presidents and Prime Ministers, he also came to play the role more of a \u2018de facto\u2019 CEO of the nation advising them on trouble shooting and steering the ship in muddy and rough waters. My piece reflects on a different aspect of his life and times, not touched upon by others.",
    "In the mid-1970s I was fairly active as a volunteer in the affairs of the Family Planning Association ofSri Lanka and had the privilege of chairing its Silver Jubilee Congress attended by Rafael Salas, the then Executive Director of UNFPA and other dignitaries. For several years I served as the Chairman of its Environmental and Population Law Committee. When Desamanya Mrs. Siva Obeysekera was the Minister of Health, she requested me to organize a national conference on Family Health and Population Growth.",
    "One agenda item was on the sociological aspects of family life in Sri Lanka. My main choice for the guest speaker on this topic was Bradman as he had studied sociology as a subject at undergraduate and post-graduate levels. The only issue was he was then based in Ampara. It was generally assumed that he was on a sort of punishment transfer having fallen into the bad books of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The Health Minister had no objection to extending him an invitation provided I did so in my personal capacity. Bradman was delighted to attend.",
    "I still remember his opening remarks: \u201cI told Dayanath though I am very happy to make this presentation my experience with family life is very limited; I have only one wife and one son\u201d. It was an excellent speech based on his perceptive observations of urban and rural patterns of family life.",
    "When the International Planned Parenthood Federation based in London had a vacancy for its Secretary-General and an international search was launched, I managed to persuade some of the leading lights in the FPA such as Mrs. Hema Basnayake , Mrs. S. A. Dissanayake, Professor C C de Silva, Dr (Ms.) Siva Chinnatamby and Daya Abeywickrema to sponsor the candidature of Bradman. There was heavy competition and even though Bradman would have made it on merit, the backing provided by Sri Lanka\u2019s FPA also carried some weight.",
    "When Bradman assumed duties he quickly settled down to understand the working culture, the looming budgetary constraints and innovative approaches required to make the maximum impact. I met Bradman several times in London. Having previously served as the Leader of the IPPF Family Planning Evaluation Mission to Bangladesh and a leading contributor on publications on Law and Population, I personally knew quite a number of staff members. Bradman\u2019s style of management was a major cultural change for the IPPF staff in London and in the regional offices who were used to bosses from Scandinavian and other developed countries. He lost no time in making organizational and operational changes and travelled widely to understand the ground realities. IPPF was the second largest financial donor for family planning work in many countries around the world. Very soon Bradman became well known as a top CEO of a multi-national international NGO.",
    "He set a standard which many of his successors\u2019 found difficult to match. Working with domestic grass-root level organizations pose all kinds of petty cultural issues. A classic example is that when the previous Director-General of WHO, the highly respected Dr. Halfdan T. Mahler joined the IPPF as the Secretary-General after having completed a 15 years\u2019 tenure as the D. G. he used to travel in the front seat of the car with the driver. This was his style even when he lived in Geneva. In some of the countries he visited for IPPF, this was perceived to be a totally unacceptable practice- the \u2018big boss\u2019 must always be seated on the back seat. Dr. Mahler was amused when this complaint was brought to his notice discreetly by the chairpersons of local FPAs. Bradman did not encounter such problems; having served with nine presidents and prime ministers with different styles of management and idiosyncrasies, he was quickly able to adapt himself to changing contexts. He was truly a CEO for all seasons.",
