    "Colombo, Feb 5 (Daily Mirror) - Justifying his earlier verbal attack on Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa, the party Chairman Sarath Fonseka said he did not have any other option but to voice his grievances in public when the party higher-ups are making unilateral decisions.",
    "He was responding to the remarks made by SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa during the weekend, where he said those who criticize the party leadership and break discipline can leave the party. Mr. Premadasa also indicated that disciplinary action would be taken against MP. Fonseka.",
    "\u201cWhen decisions are taken unitarily, and when the opportunity for discussion and discourse is not provided within the party, the only option left is to voice these grievances to the public. We should always remember that the strength of the party is its members and well-wishers and not just a select few,\u201d Field Marshal Fonseka said in his latest post on X.",
    "\u201cSJB is a party many people worked hard to build. It is through sheer hard work, dedication, and commitment that the SJB was developed. The foundation of the party is based on principles and values, and it is only if we uphold these values that can further strengthen the party,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cFor far too long, political parties have been playing petty politics, forming alliances that betray the aspirations of the people. This has resulted in a bankrupt country after 76 years of independence. It is my fervent belief that Sri Lanka has to transcend from this practice and embrace values and policies that embody transparency, accountability, and inclusive governance and leadership. It is time we transcend from the politics of identities to the politics of policies.",
    "It is true that to achieve electoral success, alliances need to be formed, but it is also important to note that these alliances need to reflect the will and aspirations of the people. If we form alliances with those that are rejected by the people, then we are causing harm to the party, we fought to collectively develop,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cWe need to work to get people together, however, what's of paramount importance is that we strive to get the right people together. Only then can we achieve the goals and objectives set for the SJB which resonate with the genuine and legitimate aspirations of the people of this our great country, Sri Lanka,\u201d he also said.",
    "Daily Mirror reliably learns that some MPs of the SJB are rallying around Fonseka while others have criticized him for his action. Criticism has come from the Party General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara himself."
