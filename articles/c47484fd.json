    "Anura rose from the humblest of origins to the pinnacle power. In the months to come more lyrical and elegant commentators than this one will serenade this young man\u2019s story and compare it to the expedition that America\u2019s greatest president undertook from log-cabin to White House. An astonishing matter is that the promises Anura gave the nation at the time he was sworn-in was very long; good governance, punishment of corrupt politicos and hangers-on, prosecution of malignant officials, unification of the nation and abolition of racism.",
    "His great American predecessor rather more pithily summed it up in a few words \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people\u201d. He engaged in war for two inseparable objectives: \u201cTo consecrate a portion of the field for those who gave their lives so that the nation might live\u201d and secondly to lay the ground for the Proclamation of Emancipation on January 1, 1863.",
    "Surprisingly, in last week\u2019s Presidential election all sections of the Tamil community, even the youth, and a goodly section of even the Muslims voted against the JVP. The performance of the NPP in the Eastern Province and the Vanni was abysmal. Why did the Tamil voter, even the radicalised youth, reject the JVP so unambiguously everywhere, even in the Up-Country? This was because the JVP\u2019s record on life or death matters for the Tamils was dismal; because its programme offered nothing to them; no offer of devolution, no hope of 13A, nothing to be gained in education, the courts or in the police stations.",
    "To win the support of the Tamil people the JVP will have to change, but are there forces within the party unwilling to agree that the movement should change its ideology on the Tamil question. A refreshing and determined voice has taken on the challenge, Anura Kumara himself. Listen to VIDEO-2024-09-28-19-47-47.MP4 where he makes a passionate plea on behalf of the upcountry Tamil people. This is different from anything you have previously heard from any JVP leader and is likely to generate a firestorm within that organisation. I have sent the link to the editors of the Colombo Telegraph and Sunday Island and they will find a way of providing readers with full access to Anura\u2019s speech.",
    "In the meantime I would like to introduce you to a debate I am having with a radical group which I call the QR tendency inside the NPP (National People\u2019s power) Movement.",
    "Me: \u201cQR, do you agree that nearly all Tamil seem to have rejected the JVP and this is a serious problem?\u201d",
    "QR: \u201cYes and it is a disaster. We have complained about this to the NPP leaders several times but they have ignored us. They think they must play-up to the JVP and not the NPP. We tried to visit the Tamils in Galle but were discouraged. Their story is that NPP will work with Digambaram and Thondaman. They expect Sumanthiran to work with them too. However educated Tamils don\u2019t like any of this\u201d.",
    "Me: \u201cBut it is good if the NPP works with Thonda and Digambaram\u201d",
    "QR: \u201cNo, it is bad. They will pursue their own interests without considering the people. What have they done so far?",
    "Me: \u201cIsn\u2019t some Tamil influence better than no Tamil influence?\u201d",
    "QR: \u201cBut Thonda and Digambaram are just using the Tamil people. They will do nothing for the poor people. They need to put their own interests aside. The poor Tamil youth should be educated to see that none of these parties will do anything for them.\u201d",
    "QR: \u201cNo, none of these people are \u201cbetter\u201d. They pursue their own interests. They are not concerned about the Tamil poor.\u201d",
    "It is clear where this is leading to \u2013 Blanquism. Contrary to Marx, Hugo Blanqui thought that the revolution should be carried out by a small group without forming alliances with others. A period of transition would permit the implementation of a new order, after which power would be handed directly to the people. Blanqui was more concerned with people\u2019s involvements in the upheaval itself. He is considered one of the founders of anarchism. He was the leading non-Marxist socialists of his day. The QR-group\u2019s rejection of all existing organisations is leading it in the same direction.",
