    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is included in a study by Asia Development Bank (ADB) which will lead to measures that will help reduce the impact of heat on women and girls, the Manila-based lender said.",
    "ADB will research how the growing threat of heat stress affects women and identify specific policies, actions, and investments that can help governments reduce the impacts of heat on women and girls.",
    "The program will be implemented in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tajikistan. It was launched at COP28.",
    "\u201cWe are on course for the warmest year on record and in Asia and the Pacific, this is placing unprecedented strain on women, on their economic productivity, their role in food security, and the infrastructure that women use,\u201d ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa said in a statement.",
    "\u201cDevelopment is no longer possible without addressing the consequences of climate change such as extreme heat\u2014and we must focus on women.\u201d",
    "Extreme heat has been linked to more than 650 billion hours of annual labor losses worldwide, equivalent to about 148 million full-time jobs\u2014a scale of disruption comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "Women are disproportionately affected by these rising temperatures, facing life-threatening conditions and substantial socioeconomic losses.",
    "\u201cEvery person on the planet is at risk of being impacted by extreme heat\u2014but the impacts are unequal,\u201d said Former President of Mexico Felipe Calder\u00f3n. \u201cPolicymakers must take measures to protect the most vulnerable communities, particularly in cities where the problem is more severe due to the urban heat island effect.",
    "The program aligns with the bank\u2019s ambition to provide $100 billion in climate financing from its own resources from 2019 to 2030, including $34 billion for adaptation. (Colombo/Dec6/2023)"
