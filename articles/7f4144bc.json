    "As Sri Lanka faces the aftershocks of multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturn and the Easter Sunday attacks, the country\u2019s education sector has become a key battleground for securing long-term economic recovery, according to Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) Research Fellow Dr. Bilesha Weeraratne.",
    "In an expert panel discussion recently in Colombo, IPS stakeholders explored the critical role of education in building a skilled workforce, while also highlighting the immense challenges that must be addressed to turn education into a catalyst for growth.",
    "Weeraratne said that with Sri Lanka suffering a negative growth rate of 6.7% by the third quarter of 2023, the labour market remains one of the hardest-hit areas.",
    "Weeraratne added: \u201cAs wages stagnate, the incentive for workers to improve their skills or seek better employment dwindles, feeding into a cycle of low productivity. Thus crisis management has prompted emergency measures, like the five-year no-pay leave policy for public sector employees.\u201d However, she explained that these are short-term fixes that do not address the deeper structural issues plaguing the labour market.",
    "Weeraratne stressed that education is seen as a powerful tool to break this cycle, but the sector itself has been grappling with severe disruptions and underfunding, she said, adding that Sri Lanka\u2019s education system is crucial in fostering productivity and innovation, but it faces serious hurdles.",
    "Her presentation delved into the many challenges facing education. From the 2019 Easter bomb attacks to the pandemic and ongoing economic crises, these external pressures have led to a decrease in education investments, depreciating resources, and the adoption of outdated approaches that struggle to meet the demands of a rapidly changing labour market.",
    "IPS, Director of Research, Dr. Nisha Arunatilake said that one alarming statistic revealed that while 97% of children aged 5 to 16 are enrolled in school, a significant proportion\u2014especially those with special needs or from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds\u2014are left behind. After the compulsory education age of 16, participation drops drastically, with only 63% qualifying for advanced level exams and just 20% attending university due to capacity issues.",
    "She noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s education system is ill-equipped to handle the demands of an evolving job market driven by technological change. `The need for highly skilled workers is growing, but 65% of 20 to 24-year-olds are not engaged in any form of education, leading to a poorly skilled workforce. While the government has made efforts to introduce vocational training, these programs have not scaled up sufficiently to address the needs of the economy.\u2019",
    "Worse still, she said, the quality of education is lagging. A 2019 study by NEREC revealed that students\u2019 English and mathematics skills are well below international standards. Students scored an average of just 34% in English and a dismal 20% in mathematics, signaling a serious gap in the education system\u2019s ability to prepare children for a globalized, technology-driven future.",
    "Arunatilake added: `Compounding the issue is the unequal allocation of resources across Sri Lanka\u2019s education system. Elite schools receive the majority of well-trained teachers, while rural schools, which often serve lower-income families, suffer from poor staffing and inadequate resources. Meanwhile, policy inconsistency\u2014driven by frequent changes in education ministers and short-term priorities\u2014has stymied long-term progress.\u2019",
    "\u2018Given the current economic constraints, while increasing funding is ideal, it is not feasible in the short term. Instead, innovative low-cost solutions could offer a way forward. Examples could be given from Pakistan, where technology is being leveraged to provide education to children with special needs and virtual labs are being used in rural areas to deliver hands-on learning experiences.",
    "\u2018Stronger governance and better allocation of resources are needed. Sri Lanka\u2019s education system has suffered from weak policy implementation and political interference. Improving governance, addressing resource inequalities, and strengthening disaster risk management are among the key recommendations.",
    "\u2018While Sri Lanka\u2019s education system faces formidable challenges, it remains a pivotal force in rebuilding the nation\u2019s economy. If the government can implement effective reforms and tap into technological solutions, the country could better equip its youth with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital and globalized world.\u2019",
