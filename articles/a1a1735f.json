    "CEO, Infinity Group, Gaurav Batra, was in Sri Lanka recently to facilitate educational facilities for Lankan students who look forward to furthering their education in foreign educational institutions.",
    "Study locations included Australia, UK, Japan, the US and Malaysia. Wide choice of such locations was actively facilitated by the Infinity Group.",
    "Batra when interviewed by the media recently said although student entrants applied for placings in these institutions, successes of entry was somewhat limited. Explaining further he said numerous factors prevented students from studying at institutions of their choice.",
    "Batra said that though in Sri Lanka education in state universities was purported to be free, generally for the average Sri Lankan, education abroad was not generally affordable.",
    "He agreed that the cost factor limited the number of local students enrolling in foreign universities. However, he said the factual position was that the Infinity Group\u2019s track record for facilitating Sri Lankan students\u2019 entry to foreign universities is impressive.",
    "Batra added: \u2018Educational disparity in Sri Lanka was evident. Out of over 350,000 students sitting the A/Level examination, reportedly 42,000 secured admission to local universities. Sri Lanka was one of the leading markets for UK universities in 2022.",
    "\u2018The limited capacity of local universities was evidently a driving factor behind his trend. The UK recorded that Sri Lanka was one of top three fastest growing markets for its education.",
    "\u2018The Infinity Group\u2019s revenue is an estimated sum of some $14.4 million. The company employs 150 persons committed to re defining excellence in education.",
