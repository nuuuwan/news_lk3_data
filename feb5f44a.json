    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya has exposed a new central bank law for its lack of accountability after the bad money agency destroyed the people\u2019s money for 74 years and drove the country into bankruptcy by trying to target a potential output.",
    "\u201cIn the new bill accountability is under question,\u201d opposition legislator Kabir Hashim said in a debate over the bill.",
    "\u201cThe central bank can continue to create instability as in the past mis-using certain clauses and powers in the bill.",
    "\u201cThere are no penalties for central bankers who fail to meet inflation targets set by parliament.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey are allowed to make people poor overnight through inflation and go Scott free. This is not fair.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn some countries governors have to resign if targets are not met. The current accountability provisions are weak or non-existent.\u201d",
    "Opposition legislators said central bank \u2018independence\u2019 was only a reference to independence from political interference, achieve price stability, but not independence from law.",
    "Related Sri Lanka following John Law, rupee debauched in MMT: legislator",
    "The current currency crisis is the worst the central bank had created, in its history.",
    "Hashim was among legislators that protested the mis-targeting of rates in the last crisis.",
    "\u201cWe want the central bank to function and achieve the objectives, but we also want to make sure that it is accountable.",
    "\u201cWe have financial crisis in this country. Different people might pass responsibilities, that different people are responsible for the financial crises, but the central bank is also responsible.",
    "\u201cPrinting of money, inflation going sky high, the central bank is responsible.\u201d",
    "A badly pegged central bank (flexible exchange rate) is the only agency that can create forex shortages, depreciate the currency (trigger BOP deficits).",
    "It will also create domestic inflation if policy rates are suppressed through open market operations for longer periods, usually about 12 to 18 months. Any currency collapse will add to it.",
    "The central bank also printed money in 2018, through overnight injection, term reverse repo, outright purchases, and dollar rupee swaps, when Wickremeratne was State Minister for Finance and depreciate the currency, despite taxes being hiked and deficit being brought down, critics have pointed out.",
    "\u201cThe Governor and the monetary board has to take responsibility for the mess that we are in,\u201d Wickremeratne said.",
    "\u201cSo on one hand we argue for the independence of the central bank, but on the other hand we have had a situation where the central bank is also responsible,\u201d",
    "\u201cExcuses that we had pressure from Presidents, Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers is not good enough.\u201d",
    "Wickremeratne said the main opposition was opposed to the dilution of the monetary board by a second council.",
    "\u201cThat is why we are proposing and amendment for that. Restrict the monetary board to seven. Don\u2019t subsume it with a Governing council.\u201d",
    "Hashim said the dilution of Section 86 by courts was a disappointment. The remedies proposed, was not good enough, he said.",
    "The new central bank law with a confusing set of goals and objectives as well as a mandate to print money for growth (target and output gap), is a requirement under the 17 th IMF program that the central bank has taken the country into.",
    "\u201cWe have confidence in the current Governor,\u201d Hashim said. \u201cBut what happens if the Governor changes. We have had Governors who have brought the country to its knees.\u201d",
    "He warned that countries that engage in stimulus, from US to the UK had ended up in crises.",
    "Others have also warned not to give \u2018independence\u2019 to Keynesians who want to target an output gap (engage in stimulus) while operating a reserve collecting central bank, which then end up in bosom of the IMF, social unrest and poverty.",
    "Hashim called on authorities to look at monetary authorities in countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Middle East and Europe that do not go the IMF and which and do not have conflicting objectives.",
    "IMF style central banks are driven by so-called Cambridge-Saltwater economics and go to the agency again and again after mis-targeting policy rates.",
    "While the IMF can stabilize currency crises with monetary \u2018shock therapy\u2019 due to policy confusions in its client central banks, the countries run into forex shortages soon and under flexible inflation targeting before the program ends.",
    "In the last two IMF programs (in 2011 and 2018) the central bank ran into currency crisis before the program ended.  (Colombo/July20/2023)"
