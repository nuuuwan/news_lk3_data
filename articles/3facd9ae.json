    "The one-day strike launched by the Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Associations (FUTA) is currently underway at all state universities across the country.",
    "As a result, lectures and all academic activities at universities have been suspended for the day.",
    "The strike has been launched based on several key concerns, including, the shortage of academic staff due to the brain drain and failure to recruit qualified personnel, salary-related issues, the lack of improvements in university infrastructure and the insufficient allocation of funds for research.",
    "FUTA members stated that despite holding discussions with government authorities on multiple occasions, no satisfactory or effective solutions have been provided thus far.",
    "Due to the strike, academic activities at major state universities \u2014 including Colombo, Peradeniya, Ruhuna, Rajarata, and Jaffna \u2014 were disrupted.",
