    "Leader of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera says that if a noble opposition is created, it can do more work than a government.",
    "He further points out that a courageous opposition will not have to remain in the opposition forever.",
    "He made these comments during a special meeting held today (12) in Waskaduwa with the candidates contesting this year\u2019s parliamentary elections from the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 under the symbol of the \u2018medal\u2019.",
    "\u201cWe are talking about nationalism, not racism. Many people are afraid to say that Sri Lanka\u2019s nationalism is based on Sinhala Buddhist civilization. They think that people will get angry if they say this.\u201d",
    "He stated that the issue is that politicians choose the racist part of nationalism and engage in politics. \u201cIt\u2019s done in the south... even in the north. We are against that.\u201d",
    "Jayaweera stated that this country can be guided towards economic development if everyone in the country is brought to an entrepreneurial mindset.",
    "\u201cThere needs to be a strategic plan. That is how countries have developed,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNow we have to go to the opposition. We came to change politics. If we form a noble opposition, we can do more work than a government. If we have a good opposition, we don\u2019t have to stay in the opposition all the time. We are a courageous opposition.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf there are cases... if there are things hidden under the bed... If there are secret accounts, it will become a cowardly opposition,\u201d he added."
