    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka should have the ability to balance between accountability and reconciliation in a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) which is now under process with the help of South Africa, Switzerland, and Japan, State Foreign Minister Tharaka Balasuriya said.",
    "Amid international pressure, Sri Lanka is pursuing a TRC to bring out the truth mainly during the final stage of a 26-year was that ended in 2009. Still hundreds of ethnic minority Tamils have been searching for their relatives who they say as \u201cforced disappeared\u201d by the state military.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s military annihilated separatists Tamil tiger rebels in the final war, but the conduct of the last stage of the conflict has raised many concerns including possible war crimes.",
    "The United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council has strongly recommended an international probe into the island nation\u2019s alleged human rights violations. Successive government since the end of the war had been reluctantly pursuing TRC concepts amid allegations of dragging a clear reconciliation process.",
    "Balasuriya said the current government is discussing about the TRC and it will not be an \u201ceye wash\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe have clearly told that we are against a process if it is only seeking retributory justice to arrest somebody,\u201d he told the reporters in Colombo at a media briefing.",
    "\u201cBut we don\u2019t have a problem taking legal action with evidence against those who used the war situation to violate the human rights of others.\u201d",
    "Tamil leaders have said the latest TRC draft has failed to meet minimum expectations in addressing the concerns of ethnic minority Tamils who have lost their loved ones in the final stage of the war.",
    "Thousands of people, mostly Tamils in Sri Lanka\u2019s north and east, went missing during the civil war, which Tamils refer as \u201cenforced disappearances\u201d, citing that their relatives surrendered to the state military on the request of the government.",
    "Most of the relatives of the disappeared people have been demanding for accountability and justice since the end of the war, but the government has failed to take any action on the disappeared people in the last 14 years since the end of the war.",
    "\u201cWe should understand that on one hand we need to consider accountability. On the other side, we need to see the reconciliation,\u201d Balasuriya said.",
    "\u201cBoth are not mutually exclusive. When you focus more on accountability, it could be harmful for reconciliation. So we should have an ability to balance these two. But we believe that there is a need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen we discussed this with the military, they told us why they should face false charges of murdering people and TRC could be an opportunity to prove their reputation. From many sides, a TRC is good. It will also help to close some of the disappeared cases,\u201d he said. (Colombo/July 26/2023)"
