But the management could be even more pleased with the way bowlers responded to the challenge, particularly Deepti Sharma and Renuka Singh.

Deepti is the leading wicket-taker of this event with nine wickets and Renuka is third on the chart with seven scalps.

### Entering the bunkering and ship salvage business

*2024-07-28 01:13:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/entering-the-bunkering-and-ship-salvage-business/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: a maverick with the Midas touch, biography of Nahil Wijesuriya

As East West continued its upward trend in business, it enjoyed a series of ‘firsts’ in diverse areas of its shipping business, the first major investment being a bunkering service. Bunkering means supplying to the fuel containers of a ship or refuelling the vessel. The company owned and operated the largest ship in Sri Lanka, the 37,000 DWT (Dead Weight Tanker) MT ‘Bunker V – previously known as the Emerald Sea – together with the feeder tankers and salvage and towage tugs, the MT ‘Rangiri’ and the MT ‘Ranveli’.

### XXXIII Olympic Games

*2024-07-28 00:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/xxxiii-olympic-games/) · `en`

Innumerable essays were written during schooldays; celebrated in 1948 was Major Desamanya Duncan M White’s Olympic silver medal in the 400m hurdles in London; and even more so Susanthika Jayasinghe’s bronze promoted to silver in the 200m sprint in 2000 in Sydney. Thus no surprise that interest runs high every four years when the Summer Olympic Games are held. After all, here is one event that draws the world together in holding the most attended and famed gathering of all, a sporting event aimed to be sans politics, enmity, corrosive competition. Rather is it meant to foster a coming together of all nations of the world in peace, inducing sportsmanship of the correct win or lose type; with no monetary awards given by IOC, the International Olympics Committee.

MPs are not strictly divided along party lines in the current parliament, except for the TNA and JVP/NPP. MPs from other parties sit on both the government and opposition sides of the House. This movement is frequently and expected to continue in the coming weeks as political maneuvering continues. However, MPs come together for moments of shared amusement, as seen last Wednesday in the lobbies during an adjournment debate on promoting Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Here, Colombo District MP Rear Admiral (Retd) Sarath Weerasekara, who is also known for his part in the films “Gamini” (2011) and “Deveni Yuddhaya” (2023), made a comment that drew laughter from both government and opposition MPs. He said that the Buddha had used AI many times. He claimed that while AI was discovered by modern Western scientists, the Buddha through meditation and spiritual attainment achieved as much.

### HUSBANDLY QUIRKS

In my maidenly era, and even earlier, most of us entered marriage with stars in our eyes. If not always stars, at least happy expectations of a cozily comfortable home life where everything fell into place and nothing other than an occasional husbandly tantrum disturbed the peace of the day. No one told us that men had quirks or that they had strange, indeed offbeat foibles.

After all, how could a mother anticipate what peculiarities her daughter’s charming fiance was going to exhibit once he had exchanged this role for that of a husband who required mollycoddling in the same manner his doting mother had provided all his life.

After the Election Commission revealed the details of the presidential election, the public expected a calm and fair election. However, two recent events are profoundly significant because they do not accommodate people’s expectations. The first is the controversial issue surrounding the Supreme Court’s (SC) interim order, which has prevented incumbent IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the police chief. This is indeed the latest of the recent events because it came days before the announcement of the date for the holding of presidential polls.

In one master stroke last Sunday afternoon, the beleaguered American President Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump and the Republican Party. From his home in Delaware, Biden tersely announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November presidential election. If that was stunning, the even greater shock and awe is the speed and manner in which Kamala Harris has rolled out her campaign; secured her nomination within hours; energized the Party at every level; enthused the youth in their own network worlds; raised millions of dollars by the minute; and served notice to Trump that she is the prosecutor, he is the felon, and she knows his type.

### Old Dogs, New Tricks: The Ongoing Battle Against Age-Related Mental Decline

Growing up in Sri Lanka in the 60s and 70s, our ambition was to secure a government job, retire by age 55, and enjoy a good pension. I often saw my male relatives doing just that, reclining in easy chairs with their legs propped up—a common and comfortable sight. However, the 80s brought dramatic changes. We scattered across the globe, embracing diverse cultures and values. In the USA, particularly, we’ve been conditioned to believe that age is just a number and that life is endless, with us as the Energizer Bunnies, going on forever.

This optimistic view was suddenly upended last week with President Joe Biden‘s announcement of his campaign termination following his disastrous debate performance. Suddenly, age-related mental decline and dementia were thrust into the spotlight, challenging the notion that we can defy the effects of aging indefinitely.

### Sri Lanka lawyers condemn government moves to retain IGP

ECONOMYNEXT – The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has condemned the government’s efforts to ‘illegally subvert the course of justice’ in relation to the Supreme Court interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon functioning as Inspector General of Police (IGP).

“The claim that the Supreme Court does not have power to call into question appointments made by the President which are approved by the Constitutional Council is, in the view of the BASL, totally untenable,” BASL said in a statement.

Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending Tennakoon from his office and suggesting that an acting appointment be made. The Court gave this verdict after granting leave to proceed for nine fundamental rights petitions filed against Tennakoon’s appointment as IGP.

However, Tennakoon remains in office, as there are no legal provisions for President Ranil Wickremesinghe to make an acting appointment now that polls have been declared, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardana has said.
