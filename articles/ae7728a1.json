    "Ceylon Cold Stores, in collaboration with Reliance Consumer Products Ltd., (RCPL), is introducing the Campa Beverages brand in Sri Lanka.",
    "The partnership marks a new phase in the relationship between the two organisations and builds on their previous collaboration, which successfully launched Elephant House Beverages into the Indian market through the Reliance Group in February last year. With the introduction of Campa, the partnership aims to offer greater choice and innovation to Sri Lankan consumers with high-quality, affordable beverages that cater to evolving tastes and expectations.",
    "Campa\u2019s entry into Sri Lanka further extends RCPL\u2019s commitment to expanding its consumer brands across key regional markets. Since acquiring Campa Cola in 2022 and reintroducing it to Indian consumers in 2023, RCPL has revitalised a legacy brand that captured the imagination of generations in the 1970s and 1980s. The brand\u2019s entry into Sri Lanka is supported by the strong market presence of Ceylon Cold Stores, a subsidiary of the John Keells Group, with its established distribution reach and operational scale.",
    "The partnership aims to deliver products that bring together nostalgia and relevance, tapping into a wide base of consumers looking for refreshing options. With this latest addition to the local beverage landscape, both companies reaffirm their intent to grow the segment with honest pricing, quality, and reach, backed by proven capabilities in brand-building and execution.",
