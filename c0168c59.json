    "In a letter to its chairman, shared by Kanchan Wijesekera on X (twitter) he said: \u201cI write to you further to the previously given instructions and policy decision to reduce cost of operations and administration that any bonuses or allowances should not be paid to any CEB employees for 2023 or for any other previous years that have not been paid.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis includes any incentives and allowances paid previously for CEB employees. The 25% salary increment paid every 3 years since 2015, should also not be continued.",
