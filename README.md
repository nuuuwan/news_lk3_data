### The Rhythms Of Karma

*2024-11-18 09:00:59* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-rhythms-of-karma/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s political and historical landscape is rich with profound events, many of which seem to be inexplicably connected through dates, numbers, and circumstances that resonate deeply with the country’s cultural, political, and spiritual journey. The deaths of pivotal figures and significant political victories or defeats align in ways that compel us to explore the workings of karma, numerology, and the inherent energy of reality. By analysing these patterns, we begin to perceive a deeper rhythm underlying the unfolding of events in Sri Lanka.

The remarkable alignment of events suggests that dates carry an inherent energy, influenced by karma and numerology. This year, 2024—a year governed by the number 8 in numerology (2+0+2+4=8)—presents a particularly transformative moment, with the historic General Election victory by National People’s Power (NPP) on 14 November 2024.

### Reimagining Independence Day 2025: From Oppression To Honoring Freedom Struggles In All Communities

The historically unprecedented multiethnic vote for the National People’s Alliance in November 2024 should not be reduced to a superficial celebration of “we are all Sri Lankans” or an invitation to forget the past and move on. Such an approach ignores the deep historical injustices symbolized by Independence Day celebrations, which cannot be undone by merely electing a new government. Instead, our vote must express our collective willingness to fundamentally free history from its injustices—a call to rethink and transform the meaning of independence into a day of making history that we can meaningfully celebrate.

Biden’s move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States’ vital military support for Ukraine.

The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
