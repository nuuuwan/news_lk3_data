    "Typically, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize gives their acceptance lecture at the awards ceremony in Oslo, Norway \u2013 but this year's recipient, Narges Mohammadi, couldn't. She remains behind bars for her long-time human rights work advocating for women's rights and democracy in Iran.",
    "So, at Sunday's ceremony, she was represented by her twin 17-year-old children \u2014 Ali and Kiana Rahmani \u2014 who delivered the speech on her behalf.",
    "\"I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison,\" they read. \"I am an Iranian woman, a proud and honorable contributor to civilization, who is currently under the oppression of a despotic religious government.\"",
    "In the wake of the 2022 death of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, a 22-year-old who died while in custody of Iran's morality police, thousands of Iranians inside the country and around the world took to the streets in protest. Such protests have since escalated into calls for regime change. Mohammadi \u2014 who is vice president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center \u2014 has long campaigned against the death penalty of protestors, even while serving multiple sentences.",
    "In her speech, Mohammadi paid tribute to those protestors, stating that she is just one of \"millions of proud and resilient Iranian women who have risen up against oppression, repression, discrimination, and tyranny.\"",
    "The prize was awarded to Mohammadi \"for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,\" according to this year's announcement by Berit Reiss-Andersen, Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee."
