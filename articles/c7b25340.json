    "Invests $8.5 million in Sri Lanka in a joint venture with AmSafe BridPort",
    "Says their income statement will be more profitable in Sri Lanka",
    "American engineering technology group Transdigm Group has invested $8.5 million in Sri Lanka in a joint venture with locally operating AmSafe BridPort to provideengineering solutions for global aviation services, the Board of Investment (BOI) said last week.",
    "The new investment saw the launch of new factory SHIELD in the western investment zone of Wathupitiwala. With the new investment SHIELD has shifted to Sri Lanka from China, BOI officials said.",
    "The foundation stone for the factory was laid on Thursday (31) in the investment zone.",
    "\u201cSHIELD\u2019s decision to shift its facility in China to establish a manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka is a testament to the growing interest of U.S. investment in Sri Lanka,\u201d U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung said in her remarks before laying the foundation stone to the factory.",
    "\u201cManufacturing moves like this one, driven by customer demand to diversify supply chains, represent a great opportunity for Sri Lanka. If the new government can strengthen the investment climate, implement anti- corruption measures, and strengthen business-friendly governance and transparency, there is potential for even more manufacturers to make similar moves.\u201d",
    "\u201cI would like to recognize Chandani Ekayanake, the General Manager of AmSafe Bridport.\u00a0 Chandani has been instrumental in leading AmSafe Bridport and assisting SHIELD in setting up operations in Sri Lanka",
    "US tech company.\u00a0 Under her leadership, AmSafe Bridport has earned Great Place to Work certifications and has been actively involved in corporate social responsibility efforts, making a positive impact on the local community.\u00a0 Chandani\u2019s success is a shining example of what women in leadership can achieve, and I hope to see more women in Sri Lanka stepping into management roles, following in her footsteps ,\u201d she said.",
    "Transdigm is a $6.6 billion worth U.S. company with more than 16,000 employees worldwide. Transdigm Group, a leading provider of engineering solutions for global aviation, is the parent company of AmSafe BirdPort, which operates in Sri Lanka.",
    "AmSafe BridPort has been providing engineering solutions for global airlines and aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus and is making a significant contribution to the country\u2019s economy, its General Manager Chandani Ekanayake said.",
    "American companies operating in China are moving to other countries due to the Section 301 tariff policy imposed by the United States on China, the BOI said in its statement.",
    "\u201cDue to the investment friendly environment in Sri Lanka, they have decided to bring the SHIELD manufacturing plants from China to Sri Lanka,\u201d it said.",
    "With the new move, SHIELD has planned to bring 100% of its Chinese manufacturing industries to Sri Lanka.",
    "SHIELD provides a range of accessories focused on safety in a variety of applications such as child seats, utility vehicles, commercial trucks, RVs, motor coaches, school/transit buses and construction/agricultural equipment.",
    "The $ 8.5 million investment is expected to create 500 direct employment opportunities for Sri Lankans, according to the BOI.",
    "Speaking to The Island, Dennis Pursel President \u2013 SHIED said, \u201cI was very keen about coming here. AmSafe BridPort has been here for over 20 years. They gave a glowing recommendation on the workforce in Sri Lanka. And the export/import duties here are a reason for us to come here and manufacture our products. There is a strong workforce here with good work ethics and we can hire educated people. The geographical location is not super helpful because it is further away from China. We have to come to the East Coast now and the distance is a bit more. But the benefits outweigh the cons. Our income statement will be more profitable. The Section 301 tariff policy imposed by the United States on China will make China-produced goods very high [in cost] by about 25% for particular goods. So, we are able to avoid that by manufacturing in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
