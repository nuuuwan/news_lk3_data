The UK, Australia, Canada and Portugal formally recognised a Palestinian State on Sunday, a move that will be followed by several European nations at a United Nations conference in Paris this week.

The meeting, co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is expected to see France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Andorra, San Marino and Malta extend recognition. More than three quarters of the UN’s 193 members already recognise Palestinian statehood. Countries that have not taken that step include the United States, Israel, Italy and Germany.

### Digitalisation or dependency? Sri Lanka’s AI dilemma beyond AKD’s binary

*2025-09-22 23:54:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Digitalisation-or-dependency-Sri-Lanka-s-AI-dilemma-beyond-AKD-s-binary/4-782027) · `en`

A binary “digitalise or perish” narrative must give way to a measured path

President Anura Kumara Disanayake has cast digital transformation as a stark binary: either embrace artificial intelligence (AI) and modernise, or be “pushed to the margins” of the global economy. His appeal identifies inefficiency, stagnation, and weak public services as consequences of past inaction. This rhetoric mirrors global leaders who treat AI as a “pillar” of competitiveness and a survival imperative.

Yet such framing is both motivational and reductionist. It risks presenting digitalisation as a technological silver bullet, obscuring the deeper questions of sovereignty, governance, and inequality that must shape Sri Lanka’s pathway.

Adam Becker cautions against equating AI with an autonomous “brain” destined to rebel against humanity. The metaphor of AI as a computer like mind is flawed, he argues, and “existential risk” talk distracts from tangible, present day harms1.

### Nepal’s uprising and lessons for South Asia

The uprisings in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka all reveal the same underlying dynamic: a critical 5% of society—small but decisive—determines the trajectory of these crises

Nepal was recently engulfed in a wave of fierce public unrest that forced the Prime Minister to resign. The uprising left vast destruction in its wake: national assets worth millions were lost, and numerous five-star hotels in Kathmandu were set ablaze. Videos flooded social media, showing enraged crowds dragging politicians through the streets while setting their homes on fire.

Observers quickly drew parallels with Sri Lanka’s “Aragalaya” (Struggle) of 2022. Bangladesh too had experienced a similar upheaval, when its Prime Minister was driven to seek refuge in India.

The Doha summit stands as a potent act of collective diplomacy

When Qatar hosted the Arab-Islamic emergency summit on 15 September 2025—just days after an Israeli strike in Doha killed Hamas leaders and a Qatari officer—expectations were high. Could this gathering produce more than a chorus of protest speeches? Would it reshape regional alignments, force policy shifts, or deepen legal and military responses? As the dust settles, Doha emerges as a significant diplomatic moment that combined high symbolism with cautious substance.1

The letter, titled "Attn: The Alleged Victim", which is spreading with the signature of the Inspector General of Police on social media, is fake, police said.

The Inspector General of Police has alleged that the 'Child and Women's Investigation Bureau' has been ordered to arrest domestic and foreign citizens who are involved in viewing, keeping, spreading, distributing or preparing children's sexual abuse pictures and videos.

This is completely false and is a action that deliberately spreads false information. The police chief or any other official section has categorically stated that the letter has never been issued.

Spreading fake documents is legally punishable offense. For official information, the police have asked the public to rely on notifications and media reports directly issued by the Sri Lanka Police Media Unit.. Remble

As speculation swirls over whether Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) government will hold provincial council elections next year, a bigger question looms: Will the NPP genuinely move forward with these elections, or is it preparing to abolish the provincial council system altogether, despite repeated assurances? Against this backdrop, India has once again reaffirmed its long-standing position—insisting that the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution is crucial for the country’s unity and stability. India’s recent statement at the 60th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is not mere diplomatic routine, but part of a decades-long commitment to Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process.

### Empowering Rooftop Solar With Smart Battery Storage: An Economic Rescue With Grid Stability

*2025-09-22 21:52:39* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/empowering-rooftop-solar-with-smart-battery-storage-an-economic-rescue-with-grid-stability/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s rooftop solar program has reached 1,700 MW across nearly 100,000 households and buildings. However, due to economic challenges and reduced tariffs for home solar investors, the program has recently slowed. While there is a strong commitment to promoting solar energy, including the President’s recent launch of a 100 MW solar project, its benefits to the public can only be fully realised if surplus power is stored.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has warned that grid instability is a risk when integrating large volumes of solar. This makes storage of daytime generation crucial for evening use, ideally through affordable and scalable methods. Unfortunately, the CEB has prioritised large-scale battery tenders, such as a proposed 640 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which would be funded at public expense. Yet investor appetite remains weak, as financial returns are limited.

### Full report on tragic Ella bus crash handed over to Transport Minister

The full report on the tragic accident on the Ella–Wellawaya road on September 4, which claimed the lives of 16 people, has been handed over to Minister of Transport Bimal Rathnayake.

The report was officially presented to the Minister today (22) at the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation.

According to the report, the bus involved in the accident had been driven by a 22-year-old, and it was his first time driving the vehicle. The report identifies that operating a bus carrying passengers along a steep and winding road — unfamiliar to the driver — was a key factor contributing to the accident.

The report also highlights that the road signs and other warning boards installed along the route where the accident occurred were not adequate for an inexperienced driver to properly assess the road’s hazardous nature.

It further states that the identity of the bus is also in question.

The EU’s cyber security agency says criminals are using ransomware to cause chaos in airports around the world.

Several of Europe’s busiest airports have spent the past few days trying to restore normal operations, after a cyber-attack on Friday disrupted their automatic check-in and boarding software.

The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, told the BBC on Monday that the malicious software was used to scramble automatic check-in systems.

“The type of ransomware has been identified. Law enforcement is involved to investigate,” the agency said in a statement to news agency Reuters.

It’s not known who is behind the attack, but criminal gangs often use ransomware to seriously disrupt their victims’ systems and demand a ransom in bitcoin to reverse the damage.

The BBC has seen internal crisis communications from staff inside Heathrow Airport which urges airlines to continue to use manual workarounds to board and check in passengers as the recovery is ongoing.
