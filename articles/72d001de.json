  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has written to the Inspector General of Police to clarify the position on lawyers\u2019 car passes, following recent public debate on the issue.",
    "In its letter, the Association said that attempts to invalidate or remove the passes on the basis of a Gazette Notification would be unlawful, since the order does not extend to the use of BASL-issued vehicle passes.",
    "The Association argued that the passes, displayed on windscreens, do not contravene the Motor Traffic Act.",
    "The BASL expressed confidence that the existing system of issuing passes would continue unchanged, emphasising their role in day-to-day legal practice and security arrangements.",
    "It noted that the passes allow attorneys-at-law to be identified when entering courts, tribunals and other institutions linked to the administration of justice, and are also used by law enforcement as verification that a vehicle belongs to a lawyer.",
    "The Association highlighted that it has issued these annual passes since 1997, making it a 28-year practice. In the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, an additional identification mechanism was introduced for vehicles at the request of security authorities, underscoring the importance of the system as a safeguard.",
    "\u201cWe are surprised to see such reports. You would no doubt appreciate the requirement for a lawyers\u2019 car pass, and we are confident that no steps will be taken to alter the present status quo,\u201d the Association said in the letter, signed by BASL President Rajeev Amarasuriya and Secretary Chathura Galhena."
