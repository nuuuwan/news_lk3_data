    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Renowned economist Ruchir Sharma, chairman of Rockefeller International and founder of Breakout Capital, offered a mixed assessment of Sri Lanka's economic trajectory during a recent address.",
    "While acknowledging commendable steps towards fiscal discipline and inflation control, Sharma also highlighted persistent concerns regarding debt accumulation and tax revenue generation.",
    "Sharma emphasized the importance of timely economic reforms, noting that most countries undertake them only during crises. He argued that reforms implemented during periods of stability yield more sustainable outcomes. However, he contrasted democracies' slower yet predictable reform pace with the riskier volatility of authoritarian regimes where \"booms and busts\" depend on leaders' whims.",
    "Sharma commended Sri Lanka's recent success in reigning in excessive government spending. However, he pointed out the crucial need to address the low tax-to-GDP ratio, currently a major fiscal challenge.",
    "While acknowledging past inflationary battles won, Sharma warned against complacency. He cautioned that Sri Lanka's recent rise in government debt over the past five years warrants close attention, as excessive borrowing often leads to economic troubles down the line.",
    "Sharma praised Sri Lanka's effective monetary policy that tamed inflation. However, he stressed the importance of sustained vigilance to prevent inflationary pressures from resurfacing.",
    "While recognizing progress in controlling spending and inflation, he urged the country to address debt management and taxation issues while maintaining sound monetary policy.",
