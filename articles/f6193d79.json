    "Despite President Anura Dissanayake\u2019s promise to bring down 50,000 new passports and reduce long queues of passport applicants, the number of people standing outside the Department of Immigration and Emigration has yet to see a decline.",

    "The new online process will be launched to reduce the queues.",

    "\u201cWe request the public to refrain from gathering near the state building from the 6th of November.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the official website, the left corner mentions \u2018Book an appointment for a passport\u2019, which will then direct to the reservation portal,\u201d she said.",
    "However, when the Government Information Center was contacted on the 1919 hotline, an official said the latest possible appointment is available only from December 3.",
    "Reservations can be made by clicking on the \u201cBook an appointment for a passport\u201d button featured on the official website and the system can currently facilitate up to 1,200 slots daily, she said.",
    "\u201cPlease do not let a third party company or an individual take money for reservation purposes,\u201d Balasooriya said.",
