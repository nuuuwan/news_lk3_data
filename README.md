Japan’s parliament on Tuesday formally elected Shigeru Ishiba, head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, as the country’s new prime minister.

Ishiba was chosen as the party’s leader on Friday to replace Fumio Kishida, who then stepped down earlier on Tuesday to pave the way.

Kishida took office in 2021 but left so his party could have a fresh leader after his government was dogged by scandals. Ishiba plans to call a parliamentary election for Oct. 27.

Opposition parties criticized Ishiba for allowing only a short period of time for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election.

Kishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term.

Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members.

### In Sri Lanka deflation was common before the policy rate, IMF Second Amendment: Bellwether

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s deflation in September 2024 has created news, but all inflation was followed by deflation for over 200 years before currency depreciation (now called flexible exchange rate) and money printing for a policy rate.

Under the currency board from 19 century and the Central Bank under Bretton  Woods specie standard, Sri Lanka’s inflation  was broadly the same as the US and the rest of the world.

Under a fixed exchange rate to the Fed, inflation that went down came down and macro-economists could not generate permanent inflation and wage destruction.

For example from 1953 January when the Colombo Consumer Price Index was at 100.1, it was only 100.7 by August 1960.

From the early 1950s as the central bank began to print money, foreign exchange controls were gradually intensified.

It was in the 1960s that the US Fed, driven by ‘macroeconomic policy’ started to aggressive cyclical policy rate manipulation, leading to reserve losses (gold) and soaring gold prices.

Public support for the government after the presidential election is on the rise. The first actions of the government have been appreciated by the general public. These include the exposure of former presidential advisors and their vehicles, the investigation ordered into the visa and passport controversies not to mention the peaceful conduct of the post-election celebrations which did not include any taking of revenge against those who had been in power. This is indeed a break with the past when the victors went on the rampage against their political opponents and included innocent ethnic and religious minorities in their frenzy.

Sri Lankans, Down Under, especially in Melbourne, are never short of entertainment. They have something exciting to look forward to, on a regular basis, and, invariably, it comes from Sri Lankan artistes…not domiciled in Australia.

On Friday, 20th September, it was the turn of another popular Sri Lankan artiste to do the needful, in Australia – Melantha Perera.

He was featured at ‘Moratuwa Night’ held in Sydney, along with the band Redemption.

On 11th October, Melantha will be seen in action again, and this time in Melbourne, with the band Ebony, at the Walawwa (Sandown Regency).

### A political and policy tightrope awaits Sri Lanka’s new president

Anura Kumara Dissanayake has emerged victorious in Sri Lanka’s Presidential election, held on 21 September 2024. Dissanayake, who obtained 42.3% of the votes, managed to secure victory over his closest competitor Sajith Premadasa, who gained 32.8% of votes.

This represents a historic change in the country. For the first time in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history, a candidate belonging to neither of the two main elite parties or their offshoots has come to power. Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe came in a distant third, with 17.3% of the votes. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, came fourth with a mere 2.6% of the votes.

### Triumph of an independent commission – a role model

A peaceful, fair, and corruption-free national election is a rare achievement for a developing, financially struggling country. However, we should take pride in our Election Commission, which excelled in planning, executing, counting, and releasing the results of a significant and complex election in a remarkably short time. Additionally, the Commission effectively mitigated post-election celebrations, preventing the violence and intimidation that often follow.

First, we must congratulate the Chairperson, R.M.A.L. Rathnayake, the Election Commission board members, and all staff for their outstanding work. Such recognition is seldom seen, even in the media, which tends to focus more on inflammatory stories that threaten peace.

These are new times indeed. The country is in a celebratory mood. We have a brand new President, and a brand new Prime Minister, who would both enjoy an anticipated majority in Parliament – a government that has infused the people with much hope. Though we have not seen a decisive victory for the new President, the country has woken up to the remarkable change the Presidential election has ushered. The times are also critical. This is the first election after the protests of 2022 – the Aragalaya-Porattam-Struggle movement. Since independence we have seen a see-sawing between two traditional parties, the UNP and the SLFP and their offshoots, coalitions, etc. In Dissanayake, we have a completely new face, a new class of face, a new ethos of politics in the promise that corruption will be eliminated from the practice of governance.
