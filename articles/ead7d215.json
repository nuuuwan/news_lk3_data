    "Private letters to an editor from Sir Henry Monck-Mason Moore (1887-1964)",
    "The great majority of letters received by the Editor of a daily newspaper are meant for publication, or deal with business matters. A small number are of a personal, even intimate nature. During 18 years of occupancy of an editorial chair, I received quite a few of the latter kind.",
    "Going through the contents of a bundle of old letters recently, I came across several letters from Governors and ex-Governors, Chief Justices who came from abroad, and members of Royal Commissions on constitutional affairs. I dare say I have lost or misplaced almost as many as those I have preserved, and looking back I regret my carelessness.",
    "The fact that some of the letters were addressed by eminent people is not due to any special merit on the part of the recipient. They were all letters to an Editor who, by virtue of his office, has certain responsibilities to society. They often helped to build up confidence and mutual goodwill.",
    "The largest number of letters from a Governor were from Sir Henry Monck-Mason Moore during whose regime Ceylon gained self-government and who was our first Governor-General. Some years later, when I decided to write a book about the British Governors of Ceylon and disclosed my plan to him, he readily agreed to help me. When my work was completed he also wrote a charming Postscript of thirty-odd pages It was something more than an \u201capologia pro vita sua\u201d and throws light on hidden corners.",
    "Henry Moore joined the Ceylon Civil Service in 1910 at the age of 23 having succeeded in the open competitive examination held in London. He left Ceylon 11 years later to become the Colonial Secretary of Bermuda. He met his future wife Daphne Benson, when she was staying in Queen\u2019s House with her mother as guests of Governor Sir William Manning. Miss Benson was a very promising artist and exhibitions of her work were held in London at various times.",
    "Henry Moore scaled the ladder of the service, having served as Colonial Secretary and Governor in Africa with a short interlude as Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office in England. In 1944 he was requested by telegram to relieve Sir Andrew Caldecott, who was retiring from the governorship of Ceylon on grounds of ill health.",
    "Moore thus returned to Ceylon 34 years after he first made his acquaintance with the Island and her people. From the beginning he had a difficult task in piloting the Government. The Donoughmore Constitution was already on its way out. Writing many years later, he said:",
    "\u201cApart from the equivocal position of the Governor, the major weakness of the Donoughmore Constitution to my mind was its failure to foster a sense of \u201cCabinet responsibility\u201d as an integral part of parliamentary government on the accepted Whitehall pattern. The Board of Ministers of course was not a Cabinet and so perhaps cannot be blamed for often refusing to accept corporate responsibility for Government policy as a whole. It was almost entirely due to the personality of Mr. D. S. Senanayake that he was able to obtain the measure of unanimity that he did, but personal jealousies were rife behind the scenes.\u201d",
    "On July 5, 1944 the Secretary of State announced in the House of Commons the decision to appoint the Royal Commission which came to be known as Soulbury Commission after the name of its chairman. Lord Soulbury and his two colleagues arrived in Ceylon towards the end of the year. Sir Henry Moore himself, enmeshed as he was in the moribund Donoughmore Constitution, was soon involved in hammering out a workable scheme of reforms on the lines proposed by the Commissioners.",
    "In a letter written to me during his retirement, Sir Henry said: I don\u2019t think I have referred to the part played by Sir Ivor Jennings in the framing of the Constitution. Senanayake had roped him in as his unofficial legal adviser. For me, as Chancellor of the University, it was a little embarrassing to have the Vice Chancellor acting in this role behind the scenes and it was sometimes resented by Nihill, as Legal Secretary, to have to meet legal points raised by \u201cJungle John\u201d (DSS) which obviously had been inspired by Jennings!",
    "However, I kept a blind eye on these proceedings, and there is no doubt that Jennings played an important part, which Senanayake recognised by insisting on his inclusion in the photographs taken after the signature of the agreements.",
    "In this connection it is interesting perhaps to note that Senanayake entrusted me with the task of negotiating them with the Colonial Office with Goonetilleke\u2019s assistance, as the political situation in Ceylon was such that he didn\u2019t like to risk going to London himself. I therefore found myself as an ex-Under Secretary of the Colonial Office championing Ceylon\u2019s case against the Colonial Office representatives, when they raised certain new points which were not covered by the brief given us by Senanayake. In the event they were successfully disposed of.",
    "When the agreement came to be signed, the Colonial Secretary was not able to come to Ceylon to sign on behalf of His Majesty\u2019s Government. So the agreement I had negotiated on behalf of Ceylon was signed by me on behalf of HMG! In retrospect a somewhat Gilbertian arrangement, although I like to think of it as a tribute to my impartiality.",
    "Sir Henry Moore made some changes in the original draft of his Postscript to the \u201cBritish Governors of Ceylon.\u201d In an earlier letter to me, he had said: \u201cIn describing the Ceylon scene as I say it from the end of 1944 to 1949 I have not pulled my punches even at the risk of being libelous but I hope they may assist you in arriving at your own independent judgement, and I am sure that I can rely on you to make use of them with the utmost discretion.\u201d",
    "In another letter he said: \u201cI return the typed copy with my recommendations and excisions. You will see that I have cut out all references to Drayton, Bandaranaike, Corea and Goonetilleke which could cause offence and controversies. It seems wiser to do so rather than single out one or two individuals for particular praise or criticism, when there are so many names that could be included.\u201d",
    "Even in his old age Sir Henry Moore wrote a firm and fluent hand. He died in 1964 at the age of 77. In a letter to me dated April 28, 1964, Lady Moore wrote: \u201cMay I say that I am grateful to you",
    "for having provided him with interesting work at a time when he was already an invalid and could not get out and about. He had, for some time been a cripple and his thought were with the past rather than the present and he found stimulation in reviving old memories of Ceylon and in reliving his youth.\u201d",
