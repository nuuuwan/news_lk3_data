  "original_body_lines": [
    "Fitch Ratings\u2019 latest update on Sri Lanka\u2019s credit landscape shows that the country\u2019s leading commercial banks and well- managed conglomerates continue to hold stable national ratings despite the weak record of the government\u2019s credit metrics.",
    "As at 31 August 2025, Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National Bank, Sampath Bank, and People\u2019s Bank retained investment-grade national ratings between AA-(lka) and A(lka) with stable outlooks. This reflects sound capital adequacy and stable deposit franchises despite a tough operating environment. Union Bank of Colombo remains an outlier with a BBB-(lka) rating on a negative outlook, while Cargills Bank was affirmed at A(lka) with a negative outlook, pointing to asset quality pressures and thinner buffers.",
    "Fitch\u2019s update also highlights a divergence between the strength of leading corporates and the sovereign\u2019s fragile external position. The sovereign rating stands at CCC+, with a country ceiling of B-, indicating continued constraints on cross-border risk exposure.",
    "In contrast, blue-chip firms such as Hayleys PLC, Lion Brewery, and Melstacorp enjoy the highest AAA(lka) national ratings, supported by diversified earnings streams and market leadership.",
    "The plantation sector continues to lag, with Kotagala Plantations stuck at CCC(lka), a reminder of deep structural challenges.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Telecom is on a Rating Watch Positive (RWP) at AA-(lka), signaling potential upgrades if operational improvements and balance sheet strengthening persist.",
    "Market analysts note that while the sovereign\u2019s credit trajectory remains tied to the success of ongoing debt restructuring and fiscal reforms, the stability of domestic banks and corporates provides a measure of reassurance to investors and creditors.",
    "Fitch\u2019s findings show that Sri Lankan banks and well-managed institutions with diversified income bases remain insulated to a degree from macro headwinds, a message that wouldn\u2019t shatter confidence in Sri Lanka\u2019s capital markets at least for the time being.",
