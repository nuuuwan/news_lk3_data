    "The Foreign Affairs Ministry on Saturday (9) said that Sri Lanka expresses deep concern over the decision by Israel to seize control of Gaza, which will lead to further escalation of violence and suffering of the people of Gaza.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka calls for an immediate ceasefire and urges all parties to resolve differences through diplomatic dialogue in order to establish sustainable peace,\u201d it said in a statement.",
    "According to the BBC, Israel intends to assume security control of the territory and establish an alternative civil administration. Israeli media reported that the initial phase would involve relocating Gaza city\u2019s residents further south and taking control of refugee camps and areas where hostages may be held, followed by a second offensive alongside increased humanitarian aid.",
    "The decision has been condemned by the UN and several countries, including the UK, France, and Canada, with Germany suspending military exports to Israel. Foreign Ministers from five nations, including Germany and the UK, warned the plan would worsen the humanitarian crisis, while UN Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk cautioned it would lead to further displacement, killings, and destruction."
