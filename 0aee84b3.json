    "Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s local currency issuer default rating from \u2018CC\u2019 to \u2018C\u2019 after a domestic debt exchange on selective bonds was announced.",
    "Fitch confirmed a \u2018B(lka)\u2019 rating of state-run CEB which has been de-linked of the government, along with lifting of the outlook.",
    "\u201cThe Positive Outlook reflects the likely upgrade of the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to reflect the sovereign\u2019s prospects following the completion of a domestic debt exchange (DDE),\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cWe will equalise CEB\u2019s ratings with that of the sovereign if the sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR is upgraded to above \u2018CC\u2019, in line with our Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria, resulting in a rating upgrade on the national scale.\u201d"
