    "Armil Sammoon, Chairman of the Sustainability Pavilion for FACETS Sri Lanka 2024, shared his thoughts: \u201cMany people are unaware of the rich history of Sri Lanka\u2019s gem industry. The idea behind the Sustainability Pavilion is to showcase this history and, more importantly, the journey towards responsible practices and sustainability. Our main focus is on how gems are responsibly sourced with minimal ecological impact and the direct benefits this brings to our community. This journey encompasses not just the industry itself, but the rich tapestry of communities that it supports.\u201d",
