    "Quite a few of India\u2019s recently elected Lok Sabha MPs have opted to swear on the country\u2019s Constitution on taking office and this augurs well for the future of secularism and democracy in India. It is of particular importance that this is happening in India because India is easily the most successful democracy in South Asia.",
    "Of course, not all Indian governments, including the present one, have adhered to the spirit and word of secularism, but this may not be quite to the point. The fact is that the Indian Constitution enshrines secularism and as long as this is so, the citizenry and civic-conscious sections of the country could fight for their fundamental rights, such as the freedom to practise a religion of their choice unhindered, in a court of law and ensure the realization of this right in case it is under threat.",
    "One of the most positive features of the Indian Constitution is its unambiguous, clear and emphatic espousal of the fundamental rights of the people. For example, discrimination against the people by the state, on the grounds of religious, ethnic and language identity, is clearly banned and eschewed.",
    "Thus, considering that secularism is an inalienable component of democracy, it obliges all those law makers to swear by the Constitution if they are in fact champions of democracy.",
    "However, not all the countries of South Asia could boast of Constitutions that establish a clear and unambiguous \u2018separation wall\u2019, so to speak, between politics and religion in the manner in which the Indian Constitution does. Sri Lanka, for example, is a disquieting failure from this viewpoint. Religious equality, for instance, it could be successfully argued, does not exist to the desired degree in Sri Lanka.",
    "A problem in this connection in Sri Lanka is that most \u2018constitutional experts\u2019, for reasons best known to them, prefer to maintain a stony silence on this question of religious equality. As a result, Sri Lanka lags in respect of democratic development.",
    "Besides, self-proclaimed progressive sections in Sri Lanka are making matters far worse by throwing in their lot with chauvinistic political forces of the country\u2019s South. From this viewpoint, it was disappointing to see the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, for instance, opting to be a member of the recently-formed \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance, a congregation of mainly Southern chauvinistic parties. One wonders on what ideological grounds the CPSL opted for membership of this nationalistic outfit. The architect of Russian communism, V.I. Lenin, would have been highly displeased at such a development, considering his castigations of nationalism in his time.",
    "On the question of democratic development in South Asia, it would be instructive to dwell awhile on Bangladesh, although it is not the intention of this columnist to project Bangladesh as a fully failed democracy. However, Bangladesh could be cited as a country which got off to a flying start as a very promising democracy but which failed to live fully up to the expectations of the admirers of democracy the world over.",
    "From this viewpoint, the novel \u2018Lajja\u2019 by Bangladeshi dissident human rights activist, Taslima Nasrin, could prove to be most revealing. The novel cannot be dismissed as \u2018a work of fiction\u2019 because it has a strong factual and historical basis to it. Although it has a story line that is probably fictional, the novel is replete with historical information on how Bangladesh\u2019s democratic experiment came to be aborted by the country\u2019s rulers of the past. So \u2018unpalatable\u2019 was the content of the novel from the viewpoint of the country\u2019s political class of past years that it stands banned today in Bangladesh.",
    "However, \u2018Lajja\u2019 is a veritable mirror to how, Bangladesh\u2019s military rulers in particular, not only aborted the country\u2019s democratic development but also undermined its strong, initial secular credentials. Under founding father Sheikh Mujibhur Rahman, Bangladesh was to be democratic, socialist and secular but these exemplary founding ideals were soon destroyed by subsequent rulers who preferred to foist on the country religious chauvinism and bigotry with a view to winning the majority Muslim vote.",
    "Not surprisingly, this divisive agenda of power hungry rulers soon led to waves upon waves of religious riots which targeted the country\u2019s minority Hindu community in particular. Going by the novel\u2019s account, it was a question of the Hindu minority being decimated in their homeland by their grasping rulers.",
    "A chief strength of \u2018Lajja\u2019 are the elaborate and detailed accounts, backed by records, of the human and material costs of these religious and ethnic riots. The author does not flinch from naming, shaming and unmasking the forces behind the unraveling of Bangladesh\u2019s democratic experiment.",
    "However, as matters stand today, Bangladesh is very much on the rebound and has emerged a considerable regional economic power. Credit is due to its present rulers who have, thus far, kept in check religious bigotry and other anti-democratic forces.",
    "Accordingly, state-inspired chauvinism of any kind is most counter-productive and self-defeating. Besides \u2018Lajja\u2019 proving the point, it is current public knowledge that authoritarian, undemocratic rule could only take a country along the path of self-annihilation. Such a road could be traversed today by any of the lesser democracies of South Asia, including Sri Lanka, unless democratic development is pursued by them in earnest.",
    "Of the \u2018South Asian Eight\u2019 it is Sri Lanka that is evincing the strongest predilections at present for opportunistic, religious bigotry inspired governance. With elections looming large, it should not come as a surprise if the \u2018religion card\u2019 is played deftly by those seeking power and those desirous of keeping power.",
    "All such trends and more should not surprise what has come to be described as the \u2018Old Left\u2019 in Sri Lanka. Rather than seeking to come to power by going in for opportunistic alliances, it would do well to work towards the public welfare on a non-partisan basis in the manner in which the Left parties of Southern India, for example, have been dong down the decades. Such endeavours have won for the Indian Left resounding public acceptance and it is of such substance that genuine politics is made.",
