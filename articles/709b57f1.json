    "In a remarkable achievement, Kamindu Mendis has become the first-ever player to slam fifty-plus scores in eight consecutive Test matches.",
    "The stylish southpaw attained the phenomenal batting feat during Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing Test match against New Zealand at Galle International Stadium.",
    "Coming at number five, Kamindu Mendis showcased exemplary skills to notch up his fourth half-century in Test cricket.",
    "After Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bowl, the hosts had a disastrous start to their first innings, losing Pathum Nissanka cheaply.",
    "However, former skipper Dimuth Karunaratne and ace batter Dinesh Chandimal helped them recover from the early setback. The duo stitched a valuable stand of 122 runs for the second wicket before Karunaratne\u2019s run out brought the Kiwis back into the game.",
    "Although Chandimal departed soon after completing his century, Kamindu Mendis joined forces with Angelo Mathews, keeping Sri Lanka ahead of their counterparts on day 1. The in-form batter brought up a sublime half-century, with the hosts finishing on 306 for three at stumps on day 1.",
    "Since making his Test comeback, Kamindu Mendis has been a force to reckon with the bat for Sri Lanka.",
    "In the recently concluded England series, the left-handed batter oozed his class, playing a pivotal role in the visitors\u2019 impressive performance.",
    "His recent performance in the second Test match against New Zealand has made him the first player in over 147 years of Test history to score more than fifty runs in each of his first eight Test matches.",
    "This impressive feat brings a fresh perspective to Mendis\u2019 career and highlights his potential as a significant player in the sport.",
    "Prior to this match, he had already set the bar high, succeeding in scoring more than fifty runs in each of his previous seven matches. Mendis surpassed the previous record held by Pakistani batsman Saud Shakeel, who managed to achieve this in seven consecutive Tests.",
    "Mendis made his Test debut against Australia in Galle in 2022, where he impressed everyone with a solid score of 61 runs. Despite not being included in the Test squad for some time following his debut, he made a significant comeback this year during the Sylhet Test against Bangladesh, where he achieved a remarkable feat of scoring centuries in both innings.",
    "He continued to showcase his talent by scoring 92 runs in the Chittagong Test, followed by an impressive 113 runs during the Manchester Test against England. Further solidifying his place, he scored 74 runs at Lord\u2019s and 64 runs in the Oval Test."
