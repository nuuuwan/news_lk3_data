    "Speaking at the Cabinet press briefing held today (03), Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said since the impact of the economic crisis has not completely receded, there is a need to provide further short-term relief to families selected in the first round of applications for the program, in relation to transitional and vulnerable categories and families selected in the second round of applications for which the selection processes have commenced.",
