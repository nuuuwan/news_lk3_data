    "StrEdge Advisory, the business consultancy arm of StrEdge Group of Companies, recently concluded a ten- month Leadership Development Programme for Finlays Colombo Limited. The participants comprised a hand-picked group of high performing professionals drawn from the middle management of Finlays. They represented a diverse cross-section of the business and were identified as future-ready leaders who would bring agility, empathy and innovation to a growing organisation.",
    "StrEdge, which offers a broad spectrum of business consultancy services including coaching and development, has today expanded its reach to an international clientele. The leadership programme was thoughtfully curated to foster growth across multiple dimensions of leadership. The deliveries included psychometric assessment (DISC executive insights) to uncover behavioural, motivational and critical thinking styles, cognitive pattern analysis, activity-based group coaching, development focused one-on-one sessions and an immersive outbound learning experience. The sessions addressed key areas such as emotional intelligence, decision making under pressure, strategic thinking and building a business owner mindset. Contributions were also made by dynamic entrepreneurs during a panel discussion on \u2018Business Owner Mindset\u2019. Key professional competencies such as strategic goal alignment, executive presence and influence without authority were also explored to equip participants for higher impact leadership roles.",
    "The programme, as StrEdge Group Director, Janaka Epasinghe, points out, sparked visible transformation where participants emerged with sharper strategic foresight, deeper self-awareness and greater emotional resilience. \u201cEach participant crafted three-to-five-year leadership roadmaps, aligning personal leadership values and ambitions with Finlays\u2019 long-term goals. From driving cross-functional innovation to embedding a performance culture, these leaders now carry the torch of organisational growth, conscious at all times that leadership is not a title but a decision; one that begins with the mindset to influence, inspire and impact,\u201d says Epasinghe, the Executive Coach for the Leadership Development Programme for Finlays.",
