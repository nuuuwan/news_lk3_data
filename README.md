“People who have serenely voted for Georgescu do not realise we are essentially talking about a total trajectory shift,” political scientist Cristian Pirvulescu said.

Appointments to the Cabinet of Ministers based purely and simply on meritocracy is unheard of anywhere. Most selections worldwide are broadly based on three criteria viz. experience, affiliation and representation. In general, political exposure and expertise in the relevant Ministerial functions are significant consideration besides qualifications for experiential appointments. Affiliational appointments include those within the personal networks of friendship, party alliances, trust, and loyalty to the President or Prime Minister. In countries where there is social diversity the government in principle align towards representational considerations based on socio-demographics like ethnic, religion, gender, regional and so on. Countries like Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom do have such representational allocations.

### Sri Lankans must improve to render system change successful

“It is not possible to develop a country without the moral development of man. Let us develop the country along with moral development (of man)” So pronounced Most Ven Madihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Thero. This translation from Sinhala is by Ven Vajiraramaya Nanaseeha Thera – previously Deshabandhu Olcott Gunasekera – who was one who assisted the venerable bhikkhu to establish the Dharmavijaya Foundation in 1977. The Foundation later adopted this truth as its mission statement. Moral development connotes character building.

The thought about the quirks and misdemeanours of most Sri Lankans which ultimately tarnish the wellbeing and image of the country has long been in mind and discussed frequently when we older generations meet and grow nostalgic of how things were back then. We most definitely had a much better life, though sans TV and all these advances, since peace and general goodness prevailed.

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.
