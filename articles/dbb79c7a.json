    "Over 17 million Sri Lankans will have the chance to vote for the country\u2019s tenth Parliament election weeks after Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential election after a historic second round of counting.",
    "This snap election, called by the new President, is expected to have significant ramifications for the nation\u2019s political gridlock, particularly as the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which currently holds only three seats, seeks to establish itself as the dominant political force.",
    "A total of 17,140,354 Sri Lankans are eligible to vote in this year\u2019s Parliamentary Election, with the Gampaha District registering the highest number of voters with 1,881,129.",

Out of 17,140,354 registered voters, a total of 13,619,916 had cast their votes in the Presidential Election which is 79.46%, while 3,520,438 (21.54%) did not vote.",

    "9. Temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for others",
    "Unlike during usual elections, voters will have their left hand\u2019s index finger, instead of the little finger, marked with an appropriate sign to prevent double voting and ensure transparency during 2024 Parliamentary Poll. This decision comes in light of concerns about possible confusion during the polling process for the Presidential Election 2024, which took place recently.",
    "Meanwhile, if a voter\u2019s left index finger is unavailable, the mark will be applied to another finger, as suitable, according to the Election Commission.",
    "The Election Commission has also issued guidelines on the proper voting and preference-marking procedure.",
    "Each voter has one vote, which can be cast for a recognized political party or an independent group. To do so, an \u2018x\u2019 mark should be placed in front of the chosen political party\u2019s symbol or in the space before the number and symbol of the independent group.",
    "Additionally, voters may express their preference for up to three candidates nominated by the selected party or group by placing an \u2018x\u2019 in the space containing the number assigned to each candidate at the end of the ballot paper.",
    "The Election Commission clarified that any ballot showing votes for multiple political parties or independent groups, or containing identifiable marks other than the specified \u2018x,\u2019 will be considered invalid. Meanwhile, only an \u2018x\u2019 mark should be used for both voting and indicating candidate preferences, as per the election regulatory body.",
    "Additionally, the Election Commission has announced guidelines regarding leave for public and private sector employees to allow them to vote. The guidelines are as follows:",

    "The political party or independent group securing the highest number of votes in the district is entitled to have one member declared elected to the Bonus seat. The remaining number of members is declared elected on the basis of the proportion of votes obtained by the political party or the independent group.",
    "In terms of section 99 (6) (a) of the Constitution, a recognised political party or independent group polling less than 5 percent of the total votes polled within the district is disqualified and the balance valid votes are reckoned for allocation of seats on the basis of the proportional computation.",
    "Dissanayake won the presidential election in September with 42.3% of the vote.

    "Dissanayake dissolved parliament soon after his voctory and called for elections to consolidate power so that he could enact crucial laws.",
    "Soon after the General Election date was declared, former President Wickremesinghe, along with many senior political figures, announced that he will not contest the general election. The Rajapaksa family has similarly opted out. This leaves Sajith Premadasa\u2019s SJB as the main challenger to the NPP.",
