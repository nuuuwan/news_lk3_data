There has been a heated argument between the members of the Dambulla Economic Center and the traders who are selling mangoes to the Dambulla Economic Center.

This is due to the fact that the new transport project has been implemented within the Dambulla Economic Center and the new system has been introduced in the sale of vegetables and fruits.

In addition, the Economic Center's Trade Association has decided to collect fines from shop owners who boycott this system and temporarily close the shops.

However, if it was decided to temporarily close the shops, there was a stir as the merchants who came to sell mangoes in the morning were dismantled.

Merchants who sell mango are not selling mangoes in lorries and on the floor near the shops, as there is no place to sell the mangoes.

The Colombo MagistrateтАЩs Court today (21) issued an arrest warrant against former Minister Douglas Devananda after he failed to appear before the court to testify in an ongoing case.

The case pertaining to a complaint lodged by Devananda with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in 2016, accusing Wellawatta-based businessman Subramaniam Manoharan of issuing two fraudulent cheques, each valued at Rs. 10 million, was taken up before the court today.

Despite being summoned to testify in court today, former Minister Devananda was absent. While his attorney claimed he was unwell, no medical documentation was submitted to substantiate the claim, Ada Derana reporter said.

Given the lack of credible justification for his absence, the Magistrate ordered the issuance of warrants to arrest and produce Devananda in court.
