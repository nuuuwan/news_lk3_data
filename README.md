Success will require both Government and citizens to embrace a shared vision — supporting reforms, backing key sectors, and investing in the nation’s future

All Share Price Index growth: 10,119 points or 93% gain post Presidential election

Market PE stands at 9.2, highly undervalued compared to regional peers

To truly understand the story of a nation, one need not look further than the pulse of its stock exchange. It is a living, breathing entity that discounts the future, processes the present, and is invariably haunted by the ghosts of the past. For 16 tumultuous years, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has been the most honest narrator of Sri Lanka’s modern saga—a tale of euphoric triumph, devastating despair and now become the forward barometer of Sri Lanka’s economic rebirth.

In exactly one year since the Presidential elections, the ASPI has gained more than 90%, gaining 10,119 points from 10,966 to 21,085 as of 19 September 2025.

Since the digital space is rich with resources, it naturally draws the interested persons to hack the systems to gain an undue enrichment. Hence, hackers and modes of hacking are aplenty.3 Government institutions are hacked not only for money but also to embarrass the rulers through temporary stoppage of government activities. Hence, AKD Government which is bent on making a digital transformation of the Sri Lanka economy is correct in its action to setup an outfit that will monitor the work of the key institutions day and night and prevent cyber attackers from destroying the system

*2025-09-22 01:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225693) · `ta`

No final decision has been taken on the proposal against Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne. United People's Power District Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said that the final decision will be taken during a meeting with opposition leaders this week.

The actions of Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne are completely contrary to parliamentary principles and the basic aspects of democracy. He does not protect the democracy of Parliament and the rights of the opposition parties. He acts on behalf of the ruling party.

It is doubtful whether the Speaker is unaware of the power and responsibility of his post. Pimal Ratnayake is directing the Speaker.

The Speaker has ignored the no -confidence motion against Deputy Minister of Defense Aruna Jayasekara.

Various parties have urged the Speaker's unilateral action to bring a no -confidence motion against him.

Fallout from a cyberattack that disrupted check-in systems at several European airports extended into a second full day on Sunday, as passengers faced dozens of canceled and delayed flights — and the impact poised to worsen for at least one major airport.

Brussels Airport, seemingly the hardest hit, said it asked airlines to cancel nearly 140 departing flights scheduled for Monday because a U.S.-based software system provider “is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.” The airport said 25 outbound flights were canceled on Saturday and 50 on Sunday.

Starting late Friday, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up check-in and sent airline staffers trying options like handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops. Many other European airports were unaffected.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed today (21) that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood, piling pressure on Israel.

“Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Carney said in a statement.

“Recognising the State of Palestine, led by the Palestinian Authority, empowers those who seek peaceful coexistence and the end of Hamas. This in no way legitimises terrorism, nor is it any reward for it,” Carney said.

Carney said the Palestinian Authority has provided “direct commitments” to Canada on reforming its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas “can play no part” and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce the UK’s recognition of a Palestinian state in a statement on Sunday afternoon.

The move comes after the prime minister said in July the UK would shift its position in September unless Israel met conditions including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and committing to a long-term sustainable peace deal that delivers a two-state solution.

It represents a major change in British foreign policy after successive governments said recognition should come as part of a peace process and at a time of maximum impact.

The move has drawn fierce criticism from the Israeli government, hostage families and some Conservatives.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously said such a move “rewards terror”.

However, UK ministers argue there was a moral responsibility to act to keep the hope of a long-term peace deal alive.

The fee, taking effect on Sunday, “applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in a post on X. “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.”

She also said that it’s a “one-time fee that applies only to the petition.”

The H-1B program allows U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers.
