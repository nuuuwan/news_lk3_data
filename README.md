The accounts and policies affected are under the names of Rambukwella’s spouse, three daughters and son-in-law and will remain frozen for a period of seven days.

The former Health Minister is currently held in remand custody over allegations related to the purchase of substandard immunoglobulin injections.

This section allows for scrutiny of the spouse, family members, or any other associated persons in corruption cases.

### Western Province land prices drop; RIUNIT signals market rebound

The Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT), an international research and consulting firm (RIUNIT) has reported a notable dip in average land prices in the Western Province, marking the first decline in the 20 years it has tracked the market.

Typically, land scarcity in island cities like Colombo creates constant upward pressure on land values. Even during Sri Lanka’s civil conflict, land prices in Colombo continued to rise.

However, in the first quarter of 2024, land prices fell in many Western Province suburbs, alarming industry experts.

RIUNIT CEO Roshan Madawela said: “Thankfully the downward trend seen at the start of the year has now turned and what we are now observing is a return to the long-term average property price increases that Colombo and the Western Province has traditionally enjoyed.”

### Why parate is so hot these days

*2024-07-05 01:18:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Why-parate-is-so-hot-these-days/14-763851) · `en`

The Parate is not that draconian as most of the people see it. Firstly it applies only for loans of which the capital is Rs. 5 million or above. In practice, no bank will exercise the Parate Right until a borrower fails to repay 7/8 instalments or more. The bank as much as possible negotiates with the borrower and carefully listens to the reasons of the borrower’s failure. Banks will in the first instance endeavour to understand whether the default is due to the own negligence of the borrower or due to something beyond his control. Even in the case of own negligence the bank will warn the borrower and try to correct him, leaving aside the Parate. When the default is beyond the control of the borrower, banks give them sound concessions based on case by case

Once the parate is abolished as proposed, the borrowers who are repaying satisfactorily will also, without thinking twice, refrain from repaying their loans

### Finance Ministry on Sri Lanka’s International Sovereign Bond Restructuring

The Joint Working Framework negotiated with the AHG provides a fair balance of risk sharing and sufficiently addresses the concerns of Sri Lanka and the requirements of bondholders. The MLB structure, following the adjustments made through the evolution of the proposed instrument, enables the appropriate sharing of upside between creditors and the debtor, whilst also ensuring that in this process, the debt sustainability of the debtor sovereign is not compromised. These terms require formal confirmation by the Secretariat of the Official Creditor Committee and the IMF staff in order to confirm conformity with comparability of treatment requirements and compliance with Sri Lanka’s IMF program debt sustainability targets

The negotiated Joint Working Framework enables a fair sharing of upside or downside between creditors and Sri Lanka in case of an economic over-performance or under-performance by Sri Lanka

### On a merry-go-round with “debt sustainability”

SL people have been left totally out of the whole process of “debt restructuring” and in the dark on “conditions and measures” the Wickremesinghe Government has agreed to

One major reason there is no transparency in any of the transactions President Wickremesinghe entered into with the IMF and in debt restructuring, is untold geo-political tie-ups. I doubt the President would ever be transparent and accountable to the people with numerous geo-political obligations that would have to remain out of public eye. But people have a right to know the conditions they are tied to in “deferring bi-lateral loan instalment payments”

Sri Lanka signing agreements with bi-lateral lenders Japan, China and India to restructure external debts has received calculated praise from SJB leadership and from the IMF with expectations. Japan congratulated Sri Lanka for effectively “managing debt obligations”.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax: A poisoned chalice?

While the IMF staff report offered a foundational framework for the proposed IRIT, recent pronouncements from the Government hint at potential divergences from the outlined plan

While the IMF recommends a wider tax net with progressive rates, the current Income Tax system, with its narrow base and high rates, suggests that policymakers might prioritise other approaches. Additionally, the IMF criticises the “Net Annual Value” concept for its reliance on exemptions (such as exempting the primary residence) and the use of assessed values. This raises the question: “Is there a contradiction between the vision of the IMF with regard to the Tax Base pertaining to IRIT and the intention of the Government”?

As per the recently published IMF Staff Level Report, it is expected that the Imputed Rental Income Tax (IRIT) would be implemented before the beginning of the tax year, April 2025.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that neither he nor his lawyers were consulted when a businessman on Wednesday filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition in the Supreme Court asking for an interpretation on the tenure of the presidency as per the island nation’s constitution.

### Labour predicted to rout Sunak’s Conservatives as Britain goes to polls

Britain looks set to elect Labour Party leader Keir Starmer as its next prime minister when voters go to the polls on Thursday, sweeping Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives out of office after 14 often turbulent years.

Opinion polls put Starmer’s centre-left party on course for a landslide victory as voters turn their backs on the Conservatives following a period of infighting and turmoil that led to five prime ministers in eight years.

However, surveys show many voters simply want change, rather than fervently backing Labour, meaning Starmer could enter office with one of the biggest to-do lists in British history but without a groundswell of support or the financial resources to tackle it.

“Today, Britain can begin a new chapter,” Starmer told voters in a statement on Thursday. “We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour.”
