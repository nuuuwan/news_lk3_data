    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s second stage of welfare benefit scheme Aswesuma could face a delay due to the backlog of the first programme which is not finalized yet due to 1.1 million appeals from applicants and objections against some listed beneficiaries.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government was to call for applications to select the second batch of Aswesuma beneficiaries by August this year amid protests by tens of thousands of people citing that their names have not been included in the list, despite they are eligible.",
    "\u201cThough we had planned to call applications to select beneficiaries for the next year, we have to wait until we finish the appeal and objection process in the current lot,\u201d Shehan Semasinghe, State Finance Minister told reporters after a media briefing at President\u2019s Media Center on Thursday (03).",
    "\u201cIf we call for new applications when officials are going through 1.1 million appeals and objections, then the workload will be higher. Then there could be a backlash. Once they finish with the current process, we will call for the next programme.\u201d",
    "He said the government is considering to start provision of benefits for the second batch from next January onward though there is no final decision on that.",
    "Wickremesinghe government has introduced the new benefit scheme to replace earlier poverty alleviation programme Samurdhi amid allegation of politicization of the previous programme. The government has estimated that 30 percent of the beneficiaries from Samudhi were not eligible to receive welfare benefits.",
    "Semasinghe said Aswesuma needs a transition time to identify deserved beneficiaries as the country has not done any data on the poor for the last 28 years. (Colombo/August 05/2023)"
