### Sri Lanka’s Adani wind power price lowered to 8.85 cents: Minister

*2024-03-21 07:51:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-adani-wind-power-price-lowered-to-8-85-cents-minister-155433/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The purchase price of a wind power plant in Mannar, Sri Lanka built by India’s Adani has now been lowered to 8.85 US cents in the latest negotiations, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“They are now proposing 8.85 US cents or about 26.90 rupees,” Minister Wijesekera told parliament.

The private plant has drawn controversy because it was not coming through competitive bidding and the initial price demanded was said to have been as high at 15.20 US cents a unit.

Power purchase agreements (PPA) which run up to 20 years are among the largest government procurement in the island and dwarfs some capital projects.

Minister Wijesekera said the plant came a government-to-government deal.  A cabinet appointed negotiation committee was appointed to sort out the price.

Some political analysts refer to such power plants as a ‘geopolitical’ cost.

There are now several plants for which prices are being negotiated without competitive tender.

### Indian Adani Group says “vicious campaign” against its Sri Lanka wind project

ECONOMYNEXT – India’s Adani Group, which is in discussion to get clearance for two renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka, has complained of a possible “vicious campaign” against its 250 MW wind-powered energy project in the island nation’s Northern district of Mannar.

Sri Lankan officials have said the Adani’s wind power project has been facing some delays as a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC) has been raising concerns over the project components including tariff.

In a fresh blow, Rohan Pethiyagoda, a prominent Sri Lankan biodiversity scientist, in a recent video said Adani’s wind project is “yet another wasteful scam” and questioned about its Environmental Assessment Impact (EIA) and the pricing.

“The EIA for Adani’s Mannar power project is little more than a shame, a stamp, a whitewash,” Pethiyagoda, a conservationist and a public-policy advocate, told in a self-explanatory video posted by himself in his own YouTube platform.

Ethical banking encourages transparency, helps build strong communities and establishes a set of principles and ideals that govern all banking activities

Any business depends and improves mainly based on the trust placed by the customers. In order to gain and enhance this trust, application of ethics in business is of paramount importance. Banking is a business that purely depends upon the trust placed by not only its customers but also by the general public. Transparency, fairness and sound decision-making are the cornerstones of a strong banking business. All these are more related to ethics in banking than of complying with rules and regulations.

### Transforming Government institutions: A beacon of development in Sri Lanka’s fishing industry

Government institutions often carry a reputation for bureaucracy, inefficiency, and stagnation. But this need not be the case. With visionary leadership, effective management, and a commitment to progress, these institutions can evolve into powerful catalysts for positive change.

It’s a common misconception that Government institutions are inherently resistant to development. While challenges exist, they are not insurmountable. Proper administration, strategic planning, and a results-oriented mind-set can drive transformation.

Effective management is the cornerstone of success. Leaders must prioritise transparency, accountability, and collaboration. A well-functioning team, aligned with a shared vision, can overcome obstacles and achieve remarkable outcomes.

Humane Peoples’ Alliance Leader Dayasiri Jayasekra yesterday said Sri Lanka urgently requires a  new program aimed at nurturing leaders who, through their political campaigns, can articulate their vision and strive to progress accordingly.

Speaking at the new alliance’s launch in Colombo, Jayasekara said the current system does not have such leaders.

“We must emphasise the necessity of a robust political program for the forthcoming decade,” he emphasised.

“Are we content with a system where 250,000 individuals live in luxury while millions suffer, or should we aspire for a more equitable future?” he asked.

Jayasekara emphasised the significance of establishing a new generation of leaders who are incorruptible, refrain from using political power to enrich their families and demonstrate foresight.

Over 20 political parties and civil society organisations joined the newly formed alliance during the event yesterday.

New European Union (EU) regulations on deforestation-free products (EUDR) are applicable for Sri Lanka’s exports, the Foreign Ministry announced yesterday.

Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane chaired a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the participation of the EU Ambassador Carmen Moreno to brief key industry stakeholders on the new EUDR.

As a direct beneficiary of the EU GSP+ concessions, Sri Lanka’s rubber exports to the EU market will have to adopt due diligence to prove that products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation.  The EU adopted the EUDR in June 2023, to ensure that agricultural products consumed by EU citizens do not contribute to global deforestation or forest degradation. The regulation will apply to the production of commodities like cattle, wood, cocoa, soy, palm oil, coffee, rubber, and their derived products.

### Ranil’s reticence, Basil’s broken base, Harsha’s Hotel California and Eran’s fire-and-fury

“…Fulfilling the California dream…the basic principles of the program of making Lanka, California…are already with us…”

- Dr. Harsha de Silva, SJB Youth Convention, Kurunegala, 16 March 2024 -

President Wickremesinghe’s first public political rally at Kuliyapitiya was odd. He delivered a zestful, even rollicking speech, remaining in the high spirits he displayed in the Mustang’s tent at the Royal-Thomian Big Match. He was rude and crude about his former lecturer at Colombo’s Faculty of Law, Prof. G.L. Peiris. He praised his pet members of the SJB, Dr. Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickramaratne. He insulted SJB leader Sajith Premadasa while pitching for the SJB to join him. He lavished praise on himself. A vintage Wickremesinghe performance, it elicited no praise outside the (small) UNP.

### Books & Elections: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s Claim Of Foreign Conspiracy

Gotabaya Rajapaksa has well explained his own tragedy where the protagonist comprehends his insignificance. To comprehend a self-diagnosis with an insignificance is neither an act of cowardice but the opposite; this value of Gotabaya’s self-diagnosis must be appreciated.

Bombs directly impact election results in South Asia, as discussed in my book ‘Conundrum of an Island’. The last major bomb attack in Sri Lanka, the Easter Sunday Terror attack, certainly altered the voter path towards restoring National Security upon the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.
