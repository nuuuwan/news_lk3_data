    "The three-day debate on the No-confidence Motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena offers an insight into the prevailing \u2018dump the lot\u2019 public opinion on the incumbent legislature. Listening to what some MPs said (sometimes yelled) during the debate helps understand the present mood in the country that the incumbent legislature has long lost its mandate which must be urgently restored through a general election.",
    "Only a few members presented coherent arguments during the debate. The government relied on its roster of provocative speakers who bellowed the usual rhetoric. Those who spoke sensibly rightly predicted that the government\u2019s numerical advantage would secure the motion\u2019s defeat. However, they cautioned that any victory would be fleeting as they believed the government\u2019s downfall was inevitable.",
    "The government ensured the attendance of its members for the vote in Parliament on Thursday evening by taking necessary measures. Initially, it had rejected the opposition\u2019s request for a three-day debate allotting time in the party leaders\u2019 meeting for only two days. However, recognizing that extending the vote by an additional 24 hours could facilitate the presence of all its members at voting time, the government decided to prolong the debate by one day.",
    "Consequently, several members, including Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Dilum Amunugama (in Canada), Bandula Gunawardena (in the US), Harin Fernando (in Austria), Manusha Nanayakkara (in Israel), and Madhura Withanage (in Russia), had to cut short their visits to ensure their presence in the House at the time of the vote.",
    "Many opposition speakers in their speeches chose to list shortcomings, mistakes, and wrongs by Abeywardena. Perhaps JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s speech was the strongest. He accused the Speaker of stuffing family members into whatever high post available in the House.",
    "Even if Abeywardena would be able to stay in his seat by mustering the required\u00a0votes, he would never be able to come back to this parliament again after the next election as people know how he abused his powers.",
    "The level of abuse of power for personal gain by Abeywardena was unprecedented in parliament history, Dissanayake said.",
    "\u201cAbeywardena is nothing but another symbol of decadence of our political system. He always acted partially towards the government. He was shameless in displaying his bias. This bias could be illustrated with one example. When Ranil Wickremesinghe and Basil Rajapaksa took their oaths as MPs, Abeywardena rose from his chair but when some other MPs took their oaths he remained seated.",
    "\u201cAbeywardena filled parliamentary posts by recruiting his kith and kin. He and his family acted as parasites of this system. His brother Wasantha Yapa Abeywardena is his private secretary, another brother Sarath Yapa Abeywardena is a Coordinating Secretary, brother-in-law Premananda Kumasaru is another coordinating secretary, another brother Indunil Yapa Abeywardena is the Media Secretary, son Chameera C Yapa Abeywardena is Public Relations Officer.",
    "\u201cIn addition to these posts, one of his sons was appointed to the post of Chairman of the Lotteries Board by the finance minister demonstrating his partiality to the president who is the finance minister. During his tenure whenever a parliament delegation went on foreign tours, it became a delegation representing the Yapa family.",
    "\u201cIn addition, the Speaker also held the post of Chairman of the Development Coordination Committee in his area. This post is an extension of the Executive. How could the head of legislature hold become an extension of the executive,\u201d Dissanayake queried.",
    "SLPP dissident MP from Badulla District, Dilan Perera, said he had not signed the motion and had considered abstaining from the debate out of respect for Mahinda Abeywardena\u2019s contributions as an MP. \u201cYet, after hearing speeches by some government members, who are intelligent lawyers including the Justice Minister, I changed my mind.",
    "\u201cThey admitted that they could not incorporate all Supreme Court recommendations to the Online Safety Bill. So, what more is there to debate? Constitutional provisions have already been violated. What more to do than remove this Speaker?",
    "\u201cPeople out there curse all of us. In such a situation how should this parliament behave? Is it by the Speaker violating the Constitution or is it by replacing Ranjith Bandara with Rohita Abeygunawadena as COPE chairman,\u201d Perera queried.",
    "When Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa declared the results, with 117 in favor and 75 against, the opposition benches of the House were nearly vacant as opposition MPs had left the Chamber after casting their votes. Notably absent from the SLPP was Namal Rajapaksa, while Mahinda Rajapaksa was present and participated in the voting process.",
    "Shortly thereafter, Abeywardena delivered a prepared statement addressing the accusations leveled against him in the motion. He disclosed that he had been approached by foreign entities to assume the presidency during the tumultuous Aragalaya protests, but he declined the offer, citing its constitutional implications.",
    "Opposition MPs, observing the speech on TV screens in the lobby, remarked that had the Speaker accepted the presidency, the entire cabinet would have been filled by Yapa Abeywardenas.",
    "A senior MP was overheard telling his colleagues that the insinuation of foreign involvement was merely a familiar SLPP tactic, dismissed as a baseless conspiracy theory.",
    "As government MPs exchanged congratulations within the Chamber, SLPP dissident MP Prof GL Peiris addressed journalists in the lobby. He said: \u201cThis government lacks legitimacy and operates on an expired mandate. Consequently, it no longer represents the people\u2019s aspirations, rendering decisions made in this parliament invalid.",
    "\u201cThroughout the history of our parliament, there have been approximately 50 NCMs. As of Friday, there have been five NCMs against the Speakers. The first dates to 1963 against Richard Stanley Pelpola. The second was in 1980, against MA Bakeer Markar. The third was against MH Mohamed in 1991, followed by another against him in 1992. The most recent one, concluded last week after a lapse of 32 years, marked the fifth instance.",
    "SJB Kurunegala District SJB MP Nalin Bandara said that the Speaker could savour victory for the time being. Asked whether the NCM was a waste of time and money knowing that the government had majority, he said that even when an NCM was brought against former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella (who was present for the voting) and the motion was defeated, many said that it was a waste of time and resources.",
    "\u201cRambukwella won the vote on the motion, but we saw what happened to him after several weeks and where he is passing the time now. Likewise, this NCM too would have repercussions and they would be detrimental to SLPP members including Abeywardena,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cJust because the motion was won, that does not mean Abeywardena was exonerated from the charges against him. The most prudent thing for him to do is resign if he has at least an iota of self-respect, MP Vijitha Herath told a group of journalists at the Jayanthipura entrance to Parliament complex.",
    "His colleague Harini Amarasuriya said that people do not recognize this parliament. The government has its numbers as we saw today. After all this parliament does not reflect the public will. It seems that this would be same for couple more months,\u201d she said.",
    "Gampaha District SJB MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said that the opposition had charges against the Speaker but the SLPP has its MPs in the House and win a vote. That won\u2019t be the case at a national level election where they won\u2019t have a ghost of a chance.",
    "The other event that grabbed the attention was the resignation spree of opposition members from COPE. At the end of sitting week, 11 MPs out of 31-member committee have resigned. SJB MP Eran Wickremaratne began the parade of resignation followed by MPs Dayasiri Jayasekara (SLFP), Charitha Herath (SLPP), S.M.Marikkar (SJB), Shanakiyan Rasamanickam (TNA), Hesha Withanage(SJB), Gamini Waleboda (SLPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake (JVP/NPP), Duminda Dissnaayke (SLPP), Wasantha Yapa Bandara (SLPP) and Dilan Perera (SLPP).",
    "Opposition MPs said Abeygunawardena had his first meeting held on Thursday and will soon be left only with his SLPP colleagues. One MP recalling Sinhala proverb, \u2018horage ammagen pena ahanawa\u2019 (i.e.,\u00a0inquiring about the thief from his mother), said that now there was no longer the need to inquire from the mother as they could ask from the thief himself (Ammagen nevei apita horagenma ahanna puluwan).",
    "Abeywardena won\u2019t be in difficulty to find his quorum, which is only four members.",
    "Champika Ranawaka told the House that there is a growing frustration among the public regarding current political practices. He said that parliament must lead by example if MPs wish to avoid public backlash. When considering Ranawaka\u2019s statements alongside the following Facebook quote, it becomes evident that a looming crisis is imminent: \u201cWhen a government declares right to be wrong and wrong right, obedience ceases to be a virtue and resistance becomes a moral duty.\u201d",
