    "\u201cOur effort to establish the land bridge, on which we have begun our joint work, promises to further provide fillip to our ongoing efforts to promote tourism between our two countries. No doubt that it will be a game changer,\u201d Jha told at the official launch of the \u201cRamayana Trail \u2013 The Sacred Mission\u201d project organised by the Supreme Global Holdings group.",
    "\u201cIt will, of course, bring many benefits to communities along the alignment of this connectivity but more specifically, it will make Ramayana and Buddhism tourism easier and more alluring to people on both sides.\u201d",
    "Historians say, according to Hindu mythology, Sri Lanka was the kingdom of Ravana, the ten-headed demon king who abducted Sita, the wife of Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, a smriti text from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahabharata.",

    "\u201cUnlike others, Indian tourists also visit both Buddhist and Hindu places of worship. They are also attracted to historical sites existing across Sri Lanka. In that sense, they are more diversified in their choice of sites and places they visit in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe economic value of attracting Indian tourists into Sri Lanka, therefore, is greater as the benefits of their travels goes to a larger cross section of people dependent on tourism business and to those who are located in all the provinces in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis is unlike other tourists, who are mostly interested in adventure and beach tourism and therefore their business benefits have more limited spread and distribution.\u201d (Colombo/April 22/2024)"
