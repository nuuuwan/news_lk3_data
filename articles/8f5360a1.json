    "He said these employees had attended the protest by closing down payment counters despite the Gazette notification declaing electricy supply as an essential service and a circular being issued cancelling the leave of all employees.",
    "The protest was launched by the CEB trade unions claiming that plans were afoot to privatise the CEB.",
    "Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara had instructed the CEB management to suspend the services of any employee who defies orders of the management and take disciplinary action accordningly."
