    "Former State Minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa has been arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).",
    "Former State Minister Rajapaksa was arrested by officers of the Bribery Commission at his residence in Nugegoda this morning (06).",
    "It has been reported that he was taken into custody in connection with an incident where compensation was obtained through another individual for a damaged building on a plot of government land in the Sevanagala-Kiriibban Wewa area which was set on fire during the 2022 island-wide protests.",
    "Several properties, including a building that had been illegally constructed on a plot of land belonging to the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority in the Sevanagala-Kiriibban Wewa area, were damaged during the public uprising that took place on May 9, 2022, the Bribery Commission stated.",
    "During the compensation process for the damaged properties, it was identified that the property belonged to the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, and thus the payment of compensation was rejected. However, it is alleged that Shasheendra Rajapaksa exerted undue influence on certain government officials assigned to the damage assessment office, using his official authority, in an attempt to obtain compensation in violation of the decision.",
    "Furthermore, he is accused of committing and conspiring to commit the offence of corruption in connection with obtaining the said compensation, as well as the unlawful and fraudulent use of government property belonging to the Mahaweli Authority.",
    "These actions are considered offenses under Section 5(1) of the State Property (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 12 of 1982, as amended by Act No. 28 of 1999, the Bribery Commission noted.",
    "Subsequent to the arrest, former State Minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa has been brought before the Bribery Commission, and it is reported that his statement is currently being recorded.",
    "He is scheduled to be produced before the Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court."
