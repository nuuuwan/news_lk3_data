Vietnam’s VNExpress newspaper reported that 197 people have died and 128 are still missing, while more than 800 have been injured.

In the capital, flood waters from the Red River receded slightly but many areas were still inundated.

In Hanoi’s Tay Ho district, people waded through muddy brown water above their knees to make their way along one street, some still wearing their bicycle and motorcycle helmets after abandoning their vehicles along the way.

A few paddled along the road in small boats as empty water bottles, a stryofoam cooler and other flotsam drifted by; one man pushed his motorbike toward drier ground in an aluminum sloop.

Pedestrians hiked up their shorts as high as possible to avoid being soaked by the wake caused by a delivery truck powering its way through the water.

### Peru’s Fujimori, divisive head of political dynasty, dies age 86

*2024-09-12 08:34:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101908/perus-fujimori-divisive-head-of-political-dynasty-dies-age-86) · `en`

Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori, who steered economic growth during the 1990s but was later jailed for human rights abuses stemming from a bloody war against Maoist rebels, died on Wednesday. He was aged 86.

Close colleagues visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in a critical condition.

“After a long battle with cancer, our father... has just departed to meet the Lord,” his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, also signed by the former leader’s other children.

Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990. He quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power.

### Sri Lanka state worker wage cost to rise 0.2-pct to 3.8-pct of GDP in 2025

*2024-09-12 07:53:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-state-worker-wage-cost-to-rise-0-2-pct-to-3-8-pct-of-gdp-in-2025-179317/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s public sector wage bill will rise to 0.2 percent to 3.8 percent in 2025, under increments proposed by a committee, the Finance Ministry has said.

In 2023, the public sector wage bill was 3.4 percent of GDP down from 4.0 percent in 2022 and it rose to 3.6 percent in 2024, the statement said.

Under proposed increments it will rise to 3.8 percent in 2024 which will be below the 2022 level.

But tax revenue are expected to go to 15 percent, with motor vehicle imports also relaxed.

The salary hike would be made within the recurrent primary expenditure (before interest), of 12.7 percent of GDP.

As a result Sri Lanka would be able to run a primary surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2025 under the IMF program.

It was not possible to increase the salary again in 2023 as Sri Lanka had to keep within the IMF program targets and it can only be done in 2025 as revenues improve, the Finance Ministry said.

இவ்வாறான வன்முறைச் சம்பவங்கள் இடம்பெற்றதாகக் கூறுபவர்களிடம் இருந்து வாக்குமூலங்களைப் பதிவு செய்து, அது எவ்வாறு அவர்களுக்குத் தெரிய வந்தது என்பதைக் கண்டறிந்து, குற்றவாளிகளுக்கு எதிராக நடவடிக்கை எடுக்குமாறு பாதுகாப்புப் படையினரிடம் சில்வா கோரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ளார்.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $100 million policy-based loan to support Sri Lanka’s water supply and sanitation sector reforms to enhance the country’s resilience to climate change impacts and promote long-term sustainability.

The Water Supply and Sanitation Reform Program, composed of two subprograms of $100 million each, will contribute to a more resilient and sustainable delivery of water supply and sanitation services.

Subprogram 1 will establish policies and strategies nationally and for the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) while the subprogram 2 will support the implementation of reform actions and guidelines.

“Efficient delivery of safe and reliable water supply in Sri Lanka is limited by fragmented water resources management and exacerbated by climate change. This significantly affects the daily life of Sri Lankans—many of whom do not have access to piped water supply,” said Senior Urban Development Specialist Pedro Almeida.

From poor morale to low employee retention rates, the negative ripples of underpaid employees can be widespread and difficult to reverse

Notwithstanding the greatness of the organisation’s culture or the exciting variety in its benefits package, the probability of an employee performing per expectations at remuneration below market is extremely low. Performance-based compensation which pays for success is a way of avoiding increases in fixed pay which arise from factors which are unrelated to success. A compensation philosophy and strategy which is in sync with the generic operating strategy are musts. If a company is unable to match the market, it must exit the business. Simple as that

AK Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa led in August but continuing shift towards President Ranil Wickremesinghe

IHP’s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) MRP provisional estimates of Presidential Election voting intent for August 2024 show NPP/JVP leader AK Dissanayake and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa led in voting preferences of all adults ahead of the September Presidential Election.

None of the four major party presidential candidates had support of a majority of the adult voters. NPP/JVP leader AK Dissanayake led with 36% of all adults, followed by SJB leader Sajith Premadasa with 32%, Pres. Ranil Wickremesinghe with 28% and Namal Rajapaksa with 3%. Estimates are associated with margins of error of 3–7%.

Support for Ranil Wickremesinghe has been rising from March through August 2024, while there have been small declines in support for AK Dissanayake, Sajith Premadasa, and SLPP during the same period.

### Anura against post-1977 economy, dodgy on devolution, can’t resolve crisis

*2024-09-12 03:42:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Anura-against-post-1977-economy-dodgy-on-devolution-can-t-resolve-crisis/4-766636) · `en`

While AKD and the JVP-NPP have changed, they haven’t metamorphosed into enlightened economic modernisers. A key marker in a brand-new document confirms that. Without a rectification on this fundamental issue contained in what the NPP designates as a ‘Framework’, it would be very dangerous to the economy to vote for Anura as President this month. That key issue is the attitude to the economic transformation of 1977, i.e., Sri Lanka’s adoption of an Open Economy --before Thatcher and Reagan did

“…This trend was exacerbated after 1977 due to unplanned and unwise economic policies & corruption…”

It will be five years on the 12th of September 2024 since my good friend Kumar Fernando left this world quite suddenly and be with his creator. Although five years seems a long time, his memory and caring ways are something that will always live in the life of those who knew this wonderful human being. I have missed him since that day five years ago and it all came flooding back to me when i went to Melbourne for a few days last month and met with his family over a lovely dinner at his daughter Tehani’s home.

Tehani and family had taken great pains to prepare a scrumptious dinner for us and whilst we all appreciated the care and trouble taken, an emptiness kept tugging at me, that something was missing and that was Kumar’s presence and enduring ways as he was always a warm and caring person. Despite the joyful evening, there was sadness in me, since I was visiting their home for the first time since his passing away.

Silence And Choreographed Timidity at South Asian University: Interview of Sasanka Perera by Anushka Kahandagamage and Kaushalya Kumarasinghe.

[Sri Lankan academic Sasanka Perera, left the South Asian University on 31 July 2024 which he had helped establish as a SAARC institution. His leaving was consequent to a targeted attack against him as the only Sri Lankan scholar in the university and one of handful of non-Indian teachers in a heavily Indian dominated space. Perera’s leaving and the widespread global coverage it received is significant black mark against academic freedom in India in general. It also marks the steady Indianization of the South Asian University which was meant to be a place of teaching and reflection for all South Asians. In this wide ranging interview, two former South Asian University students, Anushka Kahandagamage based in New Zealand and Kaushalya Kumarasinghe based in Sri Lanka speak to Perera at length about the incidents itself and its circumstances.]

### It Is Time To Recognise & Denounce Inflammatory Journalism

Journalism is a profession dedicated to collecting, preparing, and disseminating news across various print and electronic media formats. However, with advancements in technology and the rise of social media, journalism has increasingly become a tool for manipulating public opinion through orchestrated presentations and misinformation. The creation and propagation of fake news have turned the media into a revenue-generating machine for opportunistic, ad-hoc journalists, especially during election seasons. This manipulation extends to tracking individual preferences for tailored advertisements and media content, influencing public perceptions and promoting specific agendas.

The author asked Chat-GPT “In this conversation, did I ask any question bias to any particular person?” and Chat-GPT answered “No, your questions seemed neutral and open-ended. You asked for opinions on several political figures and explored their potential impact on Sri Lanka’s economy, but none of your questions were biased toward a particular individual. You were seeking informed insights rather than expressing favoritism.”

Who do you think would be the best choice to stabilize Sri Lanka’s economy during the current crisis?

ஜனாதிபதி வேட்பாளர் ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவின் பிரசாரக் குழு, பொதுக் கூட்டங்களின் எண்ணிக்கையை 92ல் இருந்து 84 ஆகக் குறைத்துள்ளதாக ஹரின் பெர்னாண்டோ தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

முன்னதாக, பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் தயாசிறி ஜயசேகர, விக்கிரமசிங்கவின் 30 க்கும் மேற்பட்ட அரசியல் பேரணிகள் மற்றும் கூட்டங்கள் மக்களின் ஆதரவின்மை காரணமாக ரத்து செய்யப்பட்டதாகக் கூறியிருந்தார்.

இதற்குப் பதிலளித்த பெர்னாண்டோ, பேரணிகளைக் குறைப்பது என்பது தொழில்முறை மன்றங்களில் பிரச்சாரத்தின் கவனத்தை மேம்படுத்துவதற்கான திட்டமிட்ட உத்தி என்று விளக்கினார்.

"வளங்களை மிகவும் திறம்பட ஒதுக்குவதற்கும், முக்கிய பங்குதாரர்கள் மற்றும் நிபுணர்களுடன் கவனம் செலுத்தும் குழுக்களுடன் ஆழமான ஈடுபாட்டிற்கு முன்னுரிமை அளிப்பதற்கும், ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவின் பிரச்சாரக் குழு பொது பேரணிகளின் எண்ணிக்கையை 92 இலிருந்து 84 ஆகக் குறைத்துள்ளது" என்று அவர் X தளத்தில் பகிர்ந்துள்ளார்.

A flash flood swept away an entire hamlet in northern Vietnam, killing 30 people and leaving dozens missing as deaths from a typhoon and its aftermath climbed to 155 on Wednesday.

Vietnamese state broadcaster VTV said the torrent of water gushing down from a mountain in Lao Cai province Tuesday buried Lang Nu hamlet with 35 families in mud and debris.

Only about a dozen are known so far to have survived. Rescuers have recovered 30 bodies and are continuing the search for about 65 others.

The death toll from Typhoon Yagi and its aftermath has climbed to 155. Another 141 people are missing and hundreds were injured, VTV said.

Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa.

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka leftist presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said his National People’s Power (NPP) is the only party to not platform MPs accused of crime or corruption, accusing the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) of opening its doors to questionable characters.

Speaking at an election rally in Kegalle on Tuesday September 10, Dissanayake claimed that a former state minister accused of swindling the stock market was now with the SJB.

MP Geetha Kumarasinghe who had only just last week praised President Ranil Wickremesinghe was now saying SJB leader Sajith Premadasa is great, he said.

“The one who made a teacher kneel in Anamaduwa is also with Sajith,” claimed Dissanayake.

The NPP presidential candidate said MP Rishad Bathiudeen who was in the centre of an alleged deforestation controversy was now with Premadasa as is a young Buddhist monk who had lodged a complaint against Bathiudeen at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).
