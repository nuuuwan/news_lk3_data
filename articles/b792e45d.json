    "In a call to action for solar cooperation across Asia and the Pacific, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya said the 21st century must be led not by fossil fuels, but by the promise of sunlight\u2014\u201dclean, abundant and universally accessible.\u201d",
    "She was addressing delegates from across the region at the 7th Regional Committee Meeting of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) for the Asia and Pacific Regions, held at the ITC Ratnadipa Colombo yesterday. The high-level gathering brought together ministers, diplomats, energy experts and institutional partners to strengthen regional solar energy strategies.",
    "\u201cIf the 20th century was defined by fossil fuel, then the 21st century must be led by the promise of sunlight, said Prime Minister Amarasuriya. \u201cThis is not merely an alternative\u2014it is an imperative.\u201d",

The meeting was marked by the formal exchange of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) between Sri Lanka and the ISA\u2014a key milestone that will guide collaboration, investments and technology transfer in Sri Lanka\u2019s solar sector.",
    "\u201cAsia and the Pacific stand at a critical junction, PM Amarasuriya said. \u201cOur region must shoulder the dual responsibility of accelerating economic growth while confronting climate vulnerabilities. Our strategies must be both resilient and equitable.\u201d",
    "She acknowledged that many countries, including Sri Lanka, were facing the twin pressures of fiscal recovery and rising energy demands, especially in remote and underserved communities. In that context, she praised ISA\u2019s role in supporting decentralised energy solutions and innovative financial models.",
    "\u201cWe are deeply grateful for the continued support of the ISA. Its work has laid a strong foundation for scaling rural electrification, which remains a top priority for our government, she added.",
    "Despite a difficult economic backdrop, Sri Lanka has exceeded expectations. Prime Minister Amarasuriya made said during her speech:",

    "She said the focus now shifts from hitting the target to sustaining it, ensuring grid stability and long-term affordability for citizens.",
    "\u2018At the heart of Sri Lanka\u2019s strategy is the \u2018Surya Balasangramaya \u2013 Battle for Solar Energy\u2019 programme, which is expanding rooftop solar panels across homes, schools and public buildings. The country has also completed two floating solar projects at Chandrika Dabba and Kiri Perth Dabba, pushing boundaries on land-scarce solar generation.",
    "\u2018Additionally, the government is in the process of revising national electricity laws to encourage competitive bidding, boost investor confidence and integrate modern solar technologies\u2019.",
    "Recognising the role of knowledge transfer in long-term transformation, the Prime Minister also announced the establishment of a Star Centre at the University of Moratuwa to serve as a regional hub for solar training and research.",
    "Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody and ISA Director-General Ashish Khanna signed the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) in the presence of regional dignitaries. The CPF outlines a clear roadmap for deepening collaboration between Sri Lanka and the ISA across training, project development, finance mobilisation, and regional knowledge exchange.",
    "ISA Director-General Khanna commended Sri Lanka\u2019s leadership in renewable energy and noted that the country could be a regional model for clean energy transition\u2014particularly for island and middle-income nations.",
