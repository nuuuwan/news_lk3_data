### Sri Lanka says Adani Port Project to continue despite US charges

Indian conglomerate Adani Group’s port project in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite US charges against its founder and sudden changes to its financing, the island nation said Friday.

A bombshell indictment in New York last month accused billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani and several colleagues of deliberately misleading international investors as part of a bribery scheme.

The charges sent Adani stocks into freefall and again raised questions over corporate governance at the family firm, whose founder is considered a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But Sri Lankan ports minister Bimal Ratnayake said the allegations against Adani had no bearing on the deep-sea container terminal project in the capital Colombo.

“The problem between Adani and the US... is not our concern,” he told reporters during a tour of the port on Thursday night.

“It is of high importance for us that western container terminal development by Adani goes ahead.”

*2024-12-13 08:02:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/204326) · `si`

Coconut shortage causes: high temperatures reduce seedling growth & pollination. Sri Lanka consumes 114 coconuts/year. Experts suggest increasing plantations to address scarcity.

🟩

Senior Professor of Professor Aruna Kumara says that the main cause of coconut shortage in the country is the hot-hot weather in the first few months of the Ruhuna.

He also said that the number of coconut seedlings in the country has reduced the number of coconut seedlings from about 70 lakhs.

"It has to be considered that the coconut is instantly increased to be scarce within a short period of time. Clear is not a quick increase. But for some time the population of these animals is increasing. High increase in temperature from March to June and the decrease in temperature and coconut availability. The best temperature for a coconut tree is a temperature like a Centigrade 27,28. But when it goes up to the centigrade, the pollination of the collise is reduced and the fruit decreases. "

In response to Ada Derana, Prof. Aruna Kumara said that Sri Lanka is the largest number of coconut consumption in the world and a person consumes 114 coconuts per year.

### Sri Lanka’s CEB seeks award of LNG terminal tender

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has recommended to the government to go ahead with a tender for a floating liquefied natural gas terminal that will allow power generation costs to be slashed, Chairman Tilak Siyambalapitiya said.

The tender for a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) to be built offshore of Kerawalapitiya was called in 2021.

The tender involved an FSRU on a built operate own basis and a compatible mooring system on a built operate own and transfer (BOOT) basis.

The competitive tender was apparently suspended in controversial circumstances amid attempts to bring in a rival unsolicited proposal by New Fortress Energy, a US-based company.

Sri Lanka could lose billions through unsolicited New Fortress Energy deal: CEBEU

Later stop gap solutions were proposed instead of completing the tender.

“Our preference is to go ahead with the bidding round that was concluded,” Siyambalapitiya told reporters.
