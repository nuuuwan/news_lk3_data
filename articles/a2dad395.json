    "The Public Health Inspectors\u2019 (PHIs) Association has raised concerns about the heightened risk of infectious diseases spreading following the recent floods.",
    "Sandun Ratnayake of the Public Health Inspectors\u2019 Association stated that individuals exposed to floodwaters are particularly vulnerable to illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery, leptospirosis and worm infestations.",
    "\u201cIf you experience symptoms of diarrhoea, dysentery, or suspected leptospirosis, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention,\u201d Ratnayake advised. He emphasized the importance of consuming only clean, fresh, and hot food during this period, and ensuring that water is either boiled or bottled to prevent waterborne diseases.",
    "Furthermore, he highlighted the risk of contracting leptospirosis for those with skin wounds or scratches exposed to floodwaters. \u201cIf you have any open wounds and have been in contact with floodwater, there\u2019s a significant chance of contracting leptospirosis. Immediate treatment is crucial.\u201d",
