    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A claim made in Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament that the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) would lose 12 trillion rupees over 15 years as a result of a domestic debt restructuring (DDR) exercise was a misrepresentation of reality, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said, defending the DDR programme as equitable.",
    "Asked to comment on a widely publicised research by an independent think tank, which was also cited by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in parliament this week, Weerasinghe told reporters that the analysis in question was built on incorrect assumptions and an \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison.",
    "The analysis had concluded that, based on the existing average yield rate, which the study had calculated to be around 13.5 percent, the EPF would lose 12 trillion rupees by 2038.",
    "\u201dThat assessment is highly inaccurate and misrepresents reality and facts and figures,\u201d said Weerasinghe, adding that it was unclear how the 13.5 percent interest rate was calculated.",
    "The EPF is Sri Lanka\u2019s single largest fund amounting to around 3.4 trillion rupees at present and is also the largest holder of treasury bonds \u2013 about 36 percent \u2013 which in turn make up over 90 percent of the fund\u2019s total investments.",
    "The analysis cited by the opposition leader notes that, at this assumed compounded rate of return of 13.52 percent, the EPF\u2019s portfolio should grow to 25.7 trillion rupees but at the offered average return of 9.1 percent, it would only grow to 13.6 trillion rupees, resulting in a 12.1 trillion-rupee loss by 2038.",
    "Governor Weerasinghe, however, expressed scepticism of this calculation at a monthly monetary policy review on Thursday July 06.",
    "\u201cThis claim is based on an assumption that the EPF\u2019s treasury bond portfolio\u2019s yield is 13.5 percent. I don\u2019t know where that came from,\u201d he said, noting that the EPF is a medium to long-term fund whose current average yield is 11.5 percent.",
    "The EPF had paid around 9 percent to beneficiaries in recent years after taxes and expenses and the 13.5-percent interest rate in the analysis in question is incorrect, he said.",
    "\u201cEven assuming that it is correct, it\u2019s still without tax. We maintain that it\u2019s 11.5 percent,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOnce taxes have been paid, the remainder is given as benefits. These people have compared the 13.5 with the 9. This is apples and oranges,\u201d he added.",
    "The claim that 12 trillion rupees would be lost by 2038, according to Weerasinghe, is built on the assumption that a 13.5 yield rate from the existing portfolio and it would require inflation to be at 15 to 18 percent for another 15 years.",
    "\u201cIf you discount under that assumption, you can inflate this up to any number, even a 100 trillion,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s debt, already deemed unsustainable, would continue to be so if a yield of 13.5 was expected till 2038, requiring more debt restructuring in the future. Inflation too would have to be at 15% and the government would have to go into more debt, said the central bank chief.",
    "\u201cThis is very unrealistic and misrepresents [facts]. Either this forecast was made without an understanding of this situation or made knowingly to mislead the public. One of the two,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAnyone can repeat what they [read somewhere else],\u201d he added. However, he said, an organisation with some credibility must ask itself what level inflation should remain until 2038 and what rate the government should obtain credit for this projection to be accurate.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for anyone to mislead the public by making incorrect comparisons based on wrong assumptions,\u201d said Weerasinghe.",
    "He did, however, acknowledge that the EPF would have to take a hit in the form of an opportunity cost.",
    "\u201cAccording to our calculations, there could be on average a long term interest of 9.4 percent, which will come down to 9.1,\u201d he said.",
    "If Sri Lanka did not go ahead with its DDO plan, which was passed by parliament last week, the government would have to announce a suspension of repayment for domestic debt the same way it did for external debt, said Weerasinghe.",
    "\u201cThen everyone \u2013 banks, depositors, EPF members \u2013 everyone would suffer,\u201d he said.",
    "The EPF, which is controlled by the central bank, is expected to get 12 bonds under the DDO.",
    "Until end 2025, the bonds will get a coupon of 12.0 percent, which will fall to 9.0 percent until maturity.",
    "Bonds will start to mature from 2027 and be subjected to market rates. The difficulty in coming up with a projection, as for the current portfolio, is to come up with a long-term interest rate, analysts say.",
    "The government is proposing to tax pension funds that do not exchange bonds, at 30 percent compared to the current 14 percent.",
    "According to Weerasinghe, the EPF is now engaged in their own analysis based on hypothetical scenarios of a) going for the 30-percent tax and b) going for the DDO.",
    "\u201cOur current calculations indicate that there is an opportunity loss of 4 percent. If the current value is 100, by 2038, because of the DDO it\u2019ll drop to 96. If you go for the tax, the estimated loss would be 21 percent. That 100 will then go down to 79. So the two choices are 96 and 79,\u201d he said.",
    "Based on the analysis cited by the opposition, on the other hand, the 100 could rise to 200.",
    "\u201cThere is no logical foundation to this analysis and it\u2019s one that misleads the public,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe have told the EPF to analyse this properly and make recommendations to the Monetary Board,\u201d he added.",
    "The central bank chief also defended the DDO plan, which has come under fire from opposition legislators for not obtaining the consent of EPF members before taking a bigger share of the debt restructuring burden.",
    "\u201cThere is no better solution that is fair by everyone,\u201d he said.",
    "The governor added that the majority\u2019s existing bank deposits also have to be taken into consideration.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re a member of the EPF, is it important to you to protect your existing funds to live now or to protect your future pension? To protect your pension, you have to live now,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIf there was a bank run, everyone including EPF members would lose what they currently have as well as their EPF,\u201d he added.",
    "The government\u2019s domestic debt restructuring plan, as it exists now, balances these two scenarios and strives to protect the assets of all citizens, according to Weerasinghe.",
    "\u201cYou have to consider the entire picture. Anyone is welcome to make alternative proposals, but we have so far not seen any other equitable proposal.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for anyone to nitpick and mislead the public. That\u2019s all I have to say,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul07/2023)"
