    "The Finance Ministry yesterday said the Government expects the scheme to fund purchase of stationery for needy school children will provide big relief to both parents and students apart from ensuring education for all.",
    "In a statement, the Finance Ministry said the \u201cHousehold Survey on the Impact of the Economic Crisis \u2013 2023,\u201d conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics, states that the adverse effects of the economic crisis have significantly impacted children\u2019s education. The survey reveals that 55% of school children have been adversely affected, with this percentage being higher in rural and estate areas. Furthermore, it was found that 53.2% of the affected children have either reduced or completely stopped purchasing school stationery, while 26.1% have resorted to re-using previously used stationery.",
    "To mitigate the adverse effects on the education of vulnerable school children, the Government decided to provide an allowance to assist with the purchase of school stationery at the beginning of the 2025 school year. Provision has already been made to provide an allowance of Rs. 6,000.00 per child for school children from Aswesuma families, and the General Treasury has taken steps to pay it through Aswesuma bank accounts by 2024.12.27.",
    "Furthermore, it is expected that the necessary allocation will be provided to the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education in the year 2025 to provide this allowance under an appropriate mechanism to obtain stationery worth of Rs. 6,000.00 per child for other suitable school children."
