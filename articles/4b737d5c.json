    "hSenid Business Solutions (hBS) released its financial results for the quarter ending on December 31, 2023, reporting a 23 percent year-over-year increase in revenues. The PeoplesHR Cloud business, constituting 76% recurring revenue, remains the primary driver having recorded a 40% growth year-on-year. The Company achieved a critical milestone in its growth journey by surpassing $3 Million in Exit ARR (Annualized Recurring Revenue). With continuous investments made in revamping and building a global sales workforce, the APAC market is now yielding the majority of new deal closures for the concluded quarter. The company\u2019s core recurring revenue, an essential component for a SaaS business, has reported further year-over-year growth of 34 percent. While the higher operating cost base resulting from the investments made in talent and market development continue to impact the company\u2019s bottom line, the core business margins continue to demonstrate steady improvements across the 3 concluded quarters of the financial year 2024.",
    "Commenting on the recurring revenue growth of the company, Founder and Chairman Dinesh Saparamadu noted: \u201cSurpassing the $3 Million Exit ARR mark demonstrates that the investments we have made with the IPO funds are beginning to yield its results. Building a strong recurring revenue base is the key to have non-linear growth in revenue typically observed in software businesses.\u201d",
    "During the quarter, the company further utilised LKR 34.0 million of its IPO funds in product development. Consequently, the company has now fully utilized the IPO funds allocated for product and market development.

    "Commenting on the results of the quarter, CEO Sampath Jayasundara stated, \u201cWe have navigated through a period of investments in the middle of a challenging operating environment, and we are pleased to see the improvements in our operating margins. Both our core business EBIT and EBITDA margins have improved steadily over the last three concluded quarters. We expect this positive trend to continue with the growth in revenues and successful completion of cost optimisation initiatives.\u201d",
