    "Hayleys Aventura (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of Hayleys PLC, recently hosted the inaugural Congress for Sustainable Materials 2024 at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo, with this year\u2019s theme based on \u2018The Future of Plastics & Packaging.\u2019",
    "The Congress showcased two panels, each representative of various industries such as Agriculture, Food, Packaging, Textiles, and Gloves in Sri Lanka. The event garnered participation from over 80 companies spanning diverse sectors, with attendees also hailing from Bangladesh, the USA, and the Maldives. Furthermore, a global audience engaged with the proceedings through live streaming, amplifying the event\u2019s reach and impact.",
    "As plastic consumption rises in Sri Lanka, the issue of non-biodegradable waste becomes increasingly critical. Landfills, expanding due to materials like plastics that take centuries to degrade, necessitate urgent action. The country has struggled with inadequate waste management systems and limited infrastructure for recycling, leading to significant environmental issues. While there were local initiatives and efforts to promote recycling, the overall success rate of these initiatives was negligible compared to the volume of waste generated, with only 5% of total plastic waste being recycled in Sri Lanka.",
    "Plastics remain an integral part of various industries due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness. Acknowledging the critical function of plastics in Sri Lankan value chains, the panel emphasized the importance of responsible plastic management. While complete elimination may not be feasible, prioritizing reuse, recycling, and responsible disposal will ensure a sustainable future for both the industry and the environment.",
    "They also explored innovative ways to maintain the benefits of traditional plastics while reducing the environmental footprint and recommended responsible plastic use, encouraging efforts such as reduction, reuse, and recycling.",
