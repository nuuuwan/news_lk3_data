  "original_title": "Why Are Our Governments So Scared Of Media People? - EDITORIAL",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Other than in the early post-independence era, governments of our country have been extremely wary of media personnel. Such was the fear of the independent press/media under the leadership of Former Premier Sirimavo Bandaranaike; her government took over the Lake House group of newspapers in the guise of broad-basing that media outfit.",
    "Unfortunately, the group was turned into a mouth-piece of the regime. \u2018Radio Ceylon\u2019 and its Sinhala and Tamil counterparts being government entities posed no threat to governments. However, broadcasters did on occasion come under pressure at different times.",
    "An example being the suspension of a particular announcer for playing the song \u2018Annie Get Your Gun\u2019 prior to the speech of the then Premier.",
    "Expansion of the media came during Former President JR Jayawardene\u2019s Presidency. The media enjoyed a brief period of good relations during this era. This changed however, especially during the Presidency of his successor R. Premadasa, who first tried to win over the support of the fourth state by offering them many sops.",
    "When these measures failed, journalists faced harassment and even death; a more famous case being the assassination of journalist Richard De Soysa, during the JVP uprising of 1989. During this period, journalists were as much in danger of being killed as were the insurrectionists who criticised or exposed government excesses.",
    "However, the largest number of journalists were killed during the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa. At least 43 journalists and media workers were either killed or \u2018disappeared\u2019. No investigation has been pursued and no perpetrators have been brought to justice.",
    "Among the more well-known journalists who paid the supreme price for standing up for journalistic principles were Taraki/Sivaram popularly known as \u2018SR\u2019 to his friends \u2013 Editor of the \u2018Tamilnet\u2019 and columnist of the \u2018Sunday Times\u2019 and \u2018The Island\u2019, and also Lasantha Wickrematunga - Journalist, Politician, Broadcaster and Editor of the \u2018Sunday Leader\u2019 newspaper.",
    "The effect of these killings and the disappearance of media personnel effectively led to self-censorship by media houses and to a muzzling of journalists themselves.",
    "Making matters even worse, today the present government is attempting to further muzzle media freedom. This time it is social media that is being targeted via the proposed \u2018Online Safety Bill\u2019; an attempt to curtail the Freedom of Expression, in online spaces.",
    "The bill seeks to establish an Online Safety Commission, consisting of five members to be appointed and/or dismissed directly by the President. This body would have the exclusive power to decide if statements made online are \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018prohibited\u2019.",
    "The appointing of a commission answerable to the President alone makes the commission into something tantamount to bodies like \u2018moral police\u2019 who are a law unto themselves.",
    "So why are our elected representatives attempting to curtail our democratic freedoms? After all, the Freedom of Expression is enshrined in our Constitution. Democracy itself rests on the four pillars of the Legislature, Executive, Judiciary, and the press.",
    "Could it be that our Parliamentary representatives believe that the media is engaged in inciting violence and hatred among various sections of the society? What our lawmakers are forgetting is that reports/articles in the media, especially on social media, are the best gauge of the people\u2019s opinion on government successes or failures.",
    "In a similar manner, the freedom to express views on a variety of issues is the best safety valve for releasing bottled-up frustrations of the people. It also provides a way of channeling these frustrations into non-violent action.",
    "We have also seen the futility of these attempts to block out particular critical voices. Not so long ago, the government blocked the \u2018Tamilnet\u2019 and the audio broadcast \u2018Voice of Tamil Eelam\u2019. But both programmes continued to draw wide audiences via alternate routes.",
    "Rather than attempting to muzzle the media, the government would do better by correcting its faults exposed by the said media. It was not social media which brought crowds onto the streets during the \u2018Aragalaya\u2019. It was the government\u2019s failure to respond to the people\u2019s hardships expressed via social media."
