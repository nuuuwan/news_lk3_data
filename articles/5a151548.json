    "South Korean author Han Kang won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature for \u201cher intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life,\u201d the award-giving body said on Thursday.",
    "The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).",
    "\u201cShe has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose,\u201d Anders Olsson, chairman of the academy\u2019s Nobel Committee, said in a statement.",
    "Han Kang, opens new tab, the first South Korean to win the literature prize, began her career in 1993 with the publication of a number of poems in the magazine Literature and Society, while her prose debut came in 1995 with the short story collection \u201cLove of Yeosu\u201d.",
    "Her major international breakthrough came with the novel \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d.",
    "Bookmaker favourites ahead of the announcement included Chinese writer Can Xue and many other perennial possible candidates such as Kenya\u2019s Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o, Australia\u2019s Gerald Murnane and Canada\u2019s Anne Carson.",
    "The literature prize is the most accessible of the Nobels for many and, as such, the Academy\u2019s choices are met with praise and criticism, often in equal measure.",
    "The Academy\u2019s omission of literary giants such as Russia\u2019s Leo Tolstoy, France\u2019s Emile Zola and Ireland\u2019s James Joyce has left many book-lovers scratching their heads over the last century.",
    "The 2016 prize award to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan was hailed as radical rethink about what literature is, but also seen as a snub to authors in more traditional genres.",
    "The prizes, for achievements in science, literature and peace, were created through a bequest in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel. They have been awarded since 1901, with the final prize in the line-up - economics - being a later addition.",
    "After peace, the literature award tends to garner the most attention, thrusting authors into the global spotlight and yielding a spike in book sales that can, however, be relatively short-lived for authors who are not household names.",
    "Even so, the prize money and a place on a list that includes luminaries such as Irish poet W.B. Yeats, who won in 1923, American novelist Ernest Hemingway, who took the award in 1954, and Colombia\u2019s Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner in 1982, is an appealing proposition.",
    "The fourth award to be handed out every year, the literature prize follows those for medicine, physics and chemistry announced earlier this week."
