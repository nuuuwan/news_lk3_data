    "Agriculture and Agrarian Services are subjects devolved to the Provinces. It was so at the time of the elected North-East Provincial Council. After the dissolution of that Council, the subject was taken over by the Centre. The matter went before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that \u201cAgrarian Services\u201d was a subject devolved to the Provinces. Yet, the Centre continues to control that subject by changing the name of the relevant institutions to \u201cAgrarian Development Department\u201d. The Centre should hand over the subject to the Provinces. However, it may be necessary for the Provinces to make a Statute for the take-over.",
