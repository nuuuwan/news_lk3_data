  "original_body_lines": [
    "France will officially recognise a Palestinian state in September, President Emmanuel Macron has said, which will make it the first G7 nation to do so.",
    "In a post on X, Macron said the formal announcement would be made at a session of the UN General Assembly in New York.",
    "\u201cThe urgent need today is for the war in Gaza to end and for the civilian population to be rescued. Peace is possible. We need an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and massive humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d he wrote.",
    "Palestinian officials welcomed Macron\u2019s decision, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move \u201crewards terror\u201d following Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack in Israel.",
    "The US \u201cstrongly rejects\u201d Macron\u2019s announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, calling the decision \u201creckless\u201d.",
    "The G7 is a group of major industrialised nations, which alongside France includes the US, the UK, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan.",
    "In his Thursday post on X, Macron wrote: \u201cTrue to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine.",
    "\u201cWe must also guarantee the demilitarisation of Hamas, and secure and rebuild Gaza.",
    "\u201cFinally, we must build the State of Palestine, ensure its viability, and ensure that by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, it contributes to the security of all in the Middle East. There is no alternative.\u201d",
    "Macron also attached a letter to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas confirming his decision.",
    "Responding to Macron\u2019s announcement, Abbas\u2019 deputy Hussein al-Sheikh said, \u201cThis position reflects France\u2019s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people\u2019s rights to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state\u201d, according to the AFP news agency.",
    "Meanwhile, Netanyahu wrote in a post on X: \u201cWe strongly condemn President Macron\u2019s decision to recognise a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the 7 October massacre.",
    "\u201cA Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel - not to live in peace beside it. Let\u2019s be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu added.",
    "Hamas said France\u2019s decision was a \u201cpositive step in the right direction\u201d and urged all countries of the world \u201cto follow France\u2019s lead\u201d.",
    "Currently, the State of Palestine is recognised by more than 140 of the 193 member states of the UN.",
    "A few European Union countries, including Spain and Ireland, are among them.",
    "But Israel\u2019s main supporter, the US, and its allies including the UK have not recognised a Palestinian state.",
    "In a statement on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he will hold an \u201cemergency call\u201d with French and German leaders on Friday to discuss \u201cwhat we can do urgently to stop the killing\u201d.",
    "Statehood is an \u201cinalienable right of the Palestinian people\u201d, Starmer said, adding that a ceasefire would \u201cput us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution\u201d.",
    "Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign ministry praised France\u2019s decision, saying it \u201creaffirms the international community\u2019s consensus on the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state\u201d.",
    "The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
    "At least 59,106 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry.",
    "Earlier on Thursday, the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) said that one in five children in Gaza City was now malnourished and cases were increasing every day.",
    "More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation in the Gaza Strip - pressing for governments to take action.",
    "Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into the Palestinian territory, has repeatedly said that there is no siege, blaming Hamas for any cases of malnutrition."
