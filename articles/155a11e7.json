    "Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - Malnutrition has emerged as a significant concern in Sri Lanka, affecting schools regardless of income levels, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said while marking the beginning of the 2024 school meal programme held today (25) at the Sujatha Girls\u2019 College in Narahenpita.",
    "\"One of our main targets is to prevent malnutrition in the country, and for that, the government has taken a decision to increase the 'Aswesuma' benefits by threefold and to provide a meal in schools.",
    "\"Some schoolchildren leave for school at 6 a.m. without taking their breakfast. They are even unable to take their lunch. Therefore, they are trying to take their meals to school. This situation has affected everyone, whether they are higher or lower income families,\" he said.",
