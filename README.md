### Speakers of Sri Lanka: “Honourable” guardians of Parliament’s sovereignty

*2024-12-27 02:47:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Speakers-of-Sri-Lanka-Honourable-guardians-of-Parliament-s-sovereignty/4-771038) · `en`

Season’s greetings to all readers! Let me begin the second part of this article on the speakers of Sri Lanka with a reference to former Speaker Asoka Ranwala. A source who is usually well-informed about matters concerning the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National People’s Power (NPP) got in touch with me a few days ago. He said that ex-Speaker Ranwala had indeed acquired a doctoral degree from Japan.

According to this JVP/NPP “partisan” source, Asoka Ranwala has indeed acquired a PhD from a Japanese institution of higher learning and is therefore entitled to the prefix “Dr”. Apparently Ranwala, a longstanding activist of the JVP, had “escaped” from Sri Lanka when the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime had cracked down hard on the JVP in the 1989-90 period. Ranwala had made his way to Japan and resided there for several years, stated this source.

### Bangladesh to re-investigate 2009 mutiny massacre, role of ‘foreign’ backers

Bangladesh on Thursday ordered a commission to investigate a failed 2009 army mutiny and subsequent crackdown, including the role of alleged “foreign” backers, the inquiry chief said.

The violent mutiny sent shock waves through the South Asian nation and ended with the army crushing the mutineers, with scores arrested and sentenced to death.

A previous official investigation into the mutiny which left scores dead blamed years of pent-up anger among ordinary soldiers, who felt their appeals for pay rises and better treatment were ignored.

But that probe was carried out during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister by a revolution in August, when she fled to old ally India.

Since her fall, families of soldiers killed in the violence have been campaigning to reopen the investigation.

They have repeatedly accused Hasina -- then newly elected -- of orchestrating a plan to weaken the military to bolster her own power in a country prone to coups.

### German supply chain act could drive Sri Lanka tea exporters away: Report

ECONOMYNEXT – Although Germany’s Supply Chain Act on Sri Lanka’s tea industry is minimal, tea exporters are likely to be driven out of the German market to countries with less stringent regulations, a policy paper by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation says.

“Particularly in cases where Germany is not an essential market for an industry, as is the case with the tea industry of Sri Lanka, the Supply Chain Act would only drive exporters away from Germany,” a policy paper on German Supply Chain Act: Impact on the tea and apparel industries of Sri Lanka showed.

The German supply chain act was passed in the Bundestag and was in effect from January 2023.

“Tea industry is generally not happy about the new law,” Sudaraka Ariyaratne, Research Consultant and Author of the Publication said at a panel discussion organized by the Foundation to discuss the Act’s implications on Sri Lanka’s tea and apparel industries.

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



The Bald Eagle is the official national bird of the USA since 1782. It appears on U.S. government seals and documents. While widely considered the national bird, its status was only officially confirmed in 1940. The question about Trump's presidency is unrelated to the eagle's symbolism.

🟩

The question arises as to whether Trump will be sworn in as president next month, as the current President of the United States has signed the National Bird Eagle.

The symbol is being inscribed in all the US government documents, as the US government stamps in the United States in 1782.. In the meantime, the ventricle has been a symbol of the US government for the past 240 years.

Many people comment that this eagle is the national bird of the United States. But in fact, it has not been officially recognized by the state as the national bird of the United States.
