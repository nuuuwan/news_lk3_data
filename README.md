### Why two-third majority for NPP?

*2024-10-20 23:02:19* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-two-third-majority-for-NPP/4-768190) ¬∑ `en`

A supportive parliament with two-third majority for NPP is an absolute must for the new regime to translate its promises into action

AKD expects his JVP-led NPP to win a majority of seats in the legislature to make his task easier. The question is whether that majority should be a simple working majority or a solid two-third majority. Disastrous consequences under governments that ruled with two-third majority in the past had provoked political pundits and opinion makers to question the wisdom of electing governments with two-third majority. Without questioning their wisdom however, a special case could be argued in favour of such a majority to the regime (the terminology is employed neutrally) headed by President AKD.

The parties that have suffered crushing defeats are now devoid of manifestos or visions, as they have plundered the nation‚Äôs resources and sold off valuable assets. It is crucial that the public be vigilant in casting their votes, ensuring that corrupt individuals do not return to power

Mr. Imtiyas Pakir Markar's report on Sri Lanka's decision not to sign a joint letter condemning Israel's ban on UN Secretary -General

Sri Lanka has a long and proud history of supporting multi -faceted, peace and justice in the global arena. Our country continues to support international efforts to resolve conflict and uphold the rights of the oppressed, including our firm support for Palestine in the United Nations.

It is very worrying that Sri Lanka has decided not to sign a joint letter issued by 105 countries, denouncing Israel's ban on entering the country.

The letter, especially in the ongoing Middle East crisis, reiterates the essential role of the United Nations in mediation and humanitarian assistance.. The refusal to join this joint call for justice and peace indicates a significant deviation from our concrete diplomatic traditions.
