Teens spend on average five hours a day on social media, of their nine hours on screens

I am talking about phenomena such as data harvesting, trolls, linkbait, sexting, two-factor authentication, ransomware and the whole nine yards of cyber security that IT administrators –and now the rest of us–lose sleep over.

### From Lebanon to Lanka: Evils of unipolarity, imperatives of resistance

Somewhere in 2011, jazz genius Herbie Hancock made a generous reference to my familiarity with jazz and blues in the LA Times, due to my inputs into International Jazz Day which he initiated at the UNESCO, Paris. This American initiative was unanimously supported by the enthusiastic membership, with every ambassador testifying about his/her indelible first encounter with jazz, a cumulative testament to its unique universality.

Mere months later, the US was isolated at UNESCO when Palestine was admitted as a member by over the mandatory two-thirds vote, despite a stern warning delivered in person by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who flew in for the purpose. I figured in this battle for Palestine too with photos appearing in Liberation (founded by Sartre) and the international press.

Several months afterwards, all of us reconverged warmly at the first ever International Jazz Day Concert by Herbie Hancock and Friends at the UNESCO auditorium in Paris.
