### AKD’s call for a ‘powerful’ government: Implications for political system

*2024-10-24 05:44:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-s-call-for-a-powerful-government-Implications-for-political-system/4-768355) · `en`

In his stump speech on the General Election campaign trail, President AKD has called for the voters to produce a “powerful” (“balavath”, “prabala”) government.

Interestingly, he did not call for a “strong” (shakthimath”) government which is conventionally the opposite of a “weak” one. Given where he’s coming from, that distinction and his choice of words should give us pause.

Sri Lanka, Ceylon at the time, was not only the first in Afro-Asia to have universal franchise but it was also the first in South Asia to evolve a two-party system. India which was independent a year before Ceylon, maintained what was defined in the political science literature as a ‘one-party dominant’ system until 1977. That was the party of Independence, the Congress party. The term ‘one-party dominant’ was minted to differentiate such countries from those which had a ‘one-party system’ be it Fascist (e.g., Spain’s Falange) or Communist.

The 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka Anura Kumara Dissanayake

One could not ask for a better market place than the recently staged Presidential election – 17.4 million consumers (voters), targeted essentially by four brands (though there were 38 Presidential candidates registered). Each brand had the stipulation of Rs. 1.8 billion within a two-month period. Given that Sri Lanka is an island nation, it was a ‘perfect market place’. All candidates had the freedom to travel, freedom to use any medium of communication. The candidate that secured the highest share was declared the winner. Let me pick up the key lessons for businesses.

This week’s 16th Conference of the Parties (CoP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is crucial for global ambitions on nature conservation. Looking to advance progress towards the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) goals and targets adopted by almost 200 countries (including Sri Lanka) at the last CoP in 2022, all attention this year is on the 700 billion dollar question, “So where will the money come from?” $ 700 billion is the annual biodiversity finance gap, identified in the GBF and analysed in detail by The Nature Conservancy. Recognising the urgent need to fill this gap, Target 19 of the GBF commits to “mobilise $ 200 billion per year for biodiversity from all sources”. As Conservation International’s Chief Strategy Officer remarked ahead of the summit in Cali, Colombia, “...negotiators cannot leave Cali without deciding where some of that funding will originate, when it will be delivered, and what groups will receive it”.

It is centuries since a few years now, there is a heavy traffic to obtain foreign passports issued by the Department of Immigration and Emigration.
