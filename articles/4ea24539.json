    "Besides, the political group led by MP Anura Priyadharshana Yapa will launch its electoral addresses on January 27 in Ja-Ela, Gampaha. That is to galvanize the electoral support of people for the possible candidacy of President Wickremesinghe. The group is also planning to form an alliance ahead of the elections. As the political chessboard continues to evolve, these early moves and strategic alignments set the stage for a gripping presidential contest in the months to come."
