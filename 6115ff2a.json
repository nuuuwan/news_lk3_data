    "With the series on the line, Sri Lanka is set to make changes for the second Test against Pakistan starting on Monday at the SSC Grounds, Head Coach Chris Silverwood confirmed, with particular focus on Asitha Fernando, who was added to the home team\u2019s squad.",
    "Sri Lanka lost the opening Test in Galle by four wickets, and now faces the prospect of losing their first series of the new World Test Championship cycle, unless they are able to reverse their fortunes in Colombo.",
    "\"There is a couple of changes we are thinking about,\" Silverwood said, playing his cards close to his chest.",
    "Since his debut in January 2021, Fernando has been Sri Lanka's most successful fast bowler in Tests, with 32 wickets in 11 matches, and he is tipped to return after recovering from dengue, while a debut for left-arm pace bowler Dilshan Madushanka has also been touted as part of the changes to the team\u2019s two-man fast bowling attack.",
    "Kasun Rajitha and Vishwa Fernando were largely anonymous in the first Test, although the typically spin-friendly Galle wicket did not help their cause, as the two fast-bowlers picked up just two wickets in 39 collective overs.",
    "The rest of the team is likely to remain the same, although Silverwood said he had emphasized a need for improvement in all three departments ahead of the first Test.",
    "\"We're looking for a better performance all-round. If we analyse the last Test match and if we are honest, I think we fell short in all three departments. I'll be looking an improvement in all three departments this Test match which I am sure we'll get,\" Silverwood added.",
    "\u201cThe dropped catches proved costly. This is not the first time it\u2019s happened. There were stages when we let them get away, at one point they scored at five runs an over, we need to drag that back,\u201d he added.",
    "Getting off the mark in the WTC has been a motivation for his players, Silverwood said.",
    "\u201cThe motivation is there. The players know how important it is to be picking up Test points, and how important it is to win at home,\u201d the former fast bowler stated.",
    "On a surface that will offer more fast-bowler friendly conditions, Pakistan\u2019s fast bowlers could prove a handful for the home team\u2019s batters.",
    "\u201cThis ground is going to be a different examination for us, with different skills required,\u201d Pakistan coach Grant Bradburn said, adding the whole squad is \u201cfit and ready\u201d for selection.",
    "\u201cCertainly we need to adapt to the conditions that we find on each of the days, and on each of the phases of the game,\u201d he opined.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes could be further hit with rain forecast over all five days of the Test."
