### Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children

*2024-12-12 20:14:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104193/queensland-to-impose-adult-prison-sentences-on-children) ¬∑ `en`

The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.

The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to ‚Äúcommunity outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders‚Äù and will act as a deterrent.

But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.

The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.

The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the ‚Äúrights of victims‚Äù ahead of ‚Äúthe rights of criminals‚Äù.

### UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees

*2024-12-12 09:30:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104178/un-general-assembly-demands-ceasefire-in-gaza-and-backs-un-agency-helping-palestinian-refugees) ¬∑ `en`

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban.

The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA.

The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group and demanding access throughout Gaza to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. Other opposing both resolutions included Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga.

While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly.
