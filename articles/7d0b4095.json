    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to publish a revised draft bill to amend Section 7 of the Mediation Board Act.",
    "The cabinet had previously approved a proposal to amend Section 7 of the Mediation Board Act No. 72 of 1988 to mandate court appearances when mediation is not agreed upon by both parties.
