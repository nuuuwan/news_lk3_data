In about ten days, on November 5, the US will have its quadrennial presidential election along with its biennial House and Senate elections. The presidential election is literally down to the wire, and the two candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are fighting it out at the margins in the so called seven swing states. At the time of writing, it is a total toss up and there is no certainty about the outcome.

In a presidential election year, the American voters mark their ballots to elect their president for four years, a third of their 100 senators for six years, and all 435 members of the House of Representatives for two years. The elections to the Senate and the House are called the ‘down ballot races’, below the main presidential runoff.

*2024-10-28 10:53:19* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/அனைத்து-வசதிகளையும்-இல்லாமல்-செய்வோம்/175-346173) · `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



Sri Lanka's President Anurag Dissanayake vows to remove perks offered to previous leaders. At a campaign rally, he stated: "We'll provide all facilities without any." He emphasized politics should serve the people, not personal interests.

🟩

கடந்த அரச தலைவர்களின் சலுகைகள் மற்றும் நன்மைகள் எதுவாக இருந்தாலும் முற்றாக நீக்கப்படும் என ஜனாதிபதி அனுரகுமார திஸாநாயக்க மீண்டும் உறுதியளித்துள்ளார்.

காலி, பத்தேகம பிரதேசத்தில் நடைபெற்ற தேர்தல் பிரசாரக் கூட்டத்தில் உரையாற்றிய அவர், முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதிகளை கவனிப்பது மக்களின் கடமையல்ல. He said that such benefits were allocated to former presidents based on circular issues, parliamentary law and constitutional arrangements.

“We are exploring the possibility of amendment to the circular and the law,” he said.

“We can't hold a country like this. 163 bodyguards, ambulances, jeep, car etc.. 17 அல்லது 18 BMW வாகனங்களைக் கோருகிறார்கள். We will do all these facilities without. Politics is the service of the people, ”he said.
