    "DIMO Academy, the vocational training arm of DIMO, entered a strategic partnership with HomeServe Germany, a global leader in home assistance, on 2 December at the Hiton Residences.",
    "By offering job placements in Germany\u2019s thriving building service sector, aimed at empowering the local youth with globally recognised qualifications, this joint endeavour marks the beginning of strengthened workforce development. Vocational training is essential as it provides individuals with practical skills and knowledge for vital career paths often overlooked by many, fostering steady employment and economic growth in Sri Lanka.",
    "As part of this partnership, DIMO Academy is set to offer world-class qualifications aligned with rigorous German vocational standards, culminating in a German diploma in plant engineering accredited by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK). The program includes German language training, ensuring graduates are well-versed to launch successful careers in Germany. Upon completion, certified graduates will secure employment with HomeServe Germany, positioning them as skilled professionals in the country\u2019s thriving building services industry. DIMO has also invested in an advanced training facility in Peliyagoda, scheduled to open in February 2025. Equipped with cutting-edge technology, the facility aims to train students to the highest international standards.",
    "This collaboration addresses the growing global demand for skilled service technicians, particularly in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)-driven by increasing focus on energy efficiency, sustainable construction, and urbanisation. Opportunities like these are crucial, especially to contribute to the skill shortages within industries in Germany, due to their high standards and dependence on renewable energies which the world is slowly adopting to. By aligning with these global benchmarks, DIMO Academy not only prepares its graduates for international technical careers but also elevates the standard of vocational education in Sri Lanka. This initiative will enhance the local building services sector by promoting a pool of technically proficient talent, equipped to meet both domestic and international standards.",
    "\u201cWe are indeed privileged to partner with HomeServe Germany, a leading company in the global building services industry,\u201d said DIMO Executive Director and Chief Human Resources Officer Dilrukshi Kurukulasuriya. \u201cThis alliance showcases the DIMO Academy\u2019s commitment to strengthening partnerships with the global industry to foster employment opportunities and the exchange of technical knowledge for local youth while fuelling their dreams and aspirations.\u201d",
    "Commenting on the benefits of vocational education, DIMO Academy Chairman Ranjith Pandithage stated: \u201cThere must be a shift in societal mind-set that recognises and celebrates alternative career paths like plumbing, mechanics, etc. We require personnel with technical and physical skills that are the basis for all the constructions and repairing we conduct across the country. In Germany, only those with certificates are eligible for work. This must apply to Sri Lanka as well. Not only will quality of services improve, but a rise in vocational training will foster lifelong learning maintaining their competitiveness in the job market. In addition, this will enable them to gain quicker entry into the workforce upon graduation as vocational education takes less time to complete compared to traditional academic routes.\u201d",
    "Elaborating on the courses offered by DIMO, DIMO Academy Head said: \u201cDIMO Academy\u2019s diplomas in Automobile Mechatronics and Plant Engineering, certified as category-A qualifications, in Germany make graduates eligible to work as technicians across the globe. DIMO Academy introduced the Diploma in Plant Engineering program to open diverse global career opportunities for young people in the building services industry. DIMO Academy offers a structured industrial training, with updated syllabus through a unique self-learning methodology and German qualified trainers, in its world-class training facilities. It also upholds high standards through a rigorous selection process, continuous assessments, and external audits by German and Sri Lankan bodies. We also highly encourage women to join our programs. The vocational world has evolved to reward brain over muscle and we are offering many STEM scholarships to women as well.\u201d",
    "HomeServe Germany CEO Thomas Rebel highlighted the immense progress made by HomeServe since its inception, with \u20ac 20 billion being spent on Professional Education and Skills in Home Services Apprenticeships (PESHA). In 2021, HomeServe Germany had 17 companies with around 800 employees and intends to expand further, he asserted.",
    "\u201cIn Germany, there is a great need for technicians in the building services industry. Being a top provider of building services, we need highly qualified technicians to support our customers. Our HVAC businesses in Germany already have an apprenticeship rate of more than 15% today. Nevertheless, the demand for skilled workers is high and cannot be solely met through education in Germany. The only school outside of Germany to offer a category \u201cA\u201d recognised training program in building services following German vocational criteria is DIMO Academy.PESHA engineers earn approximately Rs. 30 million a year.\u201d",
    "Founded in 1993, HomeServe Germany is a part of the HomeServe EMA Group that operates across Europe and Asia, specialising in plumbing, heating and electrical works. In Germany, it concentrates on residential HVAC and plumbing- providing installation, maintenance, and emergency repair services for heating, sanitary, and renewable energy systems. Students enrolling in the 2025 batch for the Diploma in Plant Engineering will be competent to join HomeServe once they successfully complete the course, ensuring a seamless transition to careers in Germany.",
