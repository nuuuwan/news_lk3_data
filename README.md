### US billionaire plans submersible trip to Titanic wreck

*2024-05-29 11:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/US-billionaire-plans-submersible-trip-to-Titanic-wreck/107-283599) · `en`

BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

Ohio tycoon and adventurer Larry Connor and Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines, say they want to take a sub to a depth of around 3,800m (12,467ft) to see the shipwreck in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr Connor’s company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer – the “4000” refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.

### Sri Lanka retail sales picking up, private credit expected to follow: CB Governor

*2024-05-29 07:53:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-retail-sales-picking-up-private-credit-expected-to-follow-cb-governor-165173/) · `en`

ECONMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s retail sales are picking up and private credit is expected to follow in the second half of the year if businesses begin investing for expansion, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

Though private credit is positive it is still ‘sluggish’ , the central bank said.

Businesses are trying to de-leverage after a currency crisis, and also re-negotiate old loans with lower interest rates as complaints from the SME sector shows.

De-leveraging is part of a credit cycle that improves the balance sheets of business across the board and leaves them in a stronger position to expand in the future.

To expand however retail sales have to pick up. Capital investments then start as existing capacity or slack runs out and there is more confidence in the future.

“We have seen retail sales picking up in the recent past,” Governor Weerasinghe said. “I think that will push up some of the SME borrowings in the coming months.”

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is tightening governance of state banks to reduce state bank lending, especially to loss-making state enterprises, which have been used for off-budget spending in the past, a finance ministry statement said.

“The balance sheets of state-owned banks have been used to absorb losses of State-owned Enterprises and help finance large fiscal deficits, thereby delaying reforms and accumulating debts, which contribute to the economic crisis,” the statement said.

State banks in the future will finance SOEs on commercial terms, competing with private sector banks. Any dollar loans will be in line with their net open position exposures.

Loans to loss making SOEs beyond 5 percent of equity will require special board approval and risk management sign off.

Any loans against Treasury guarantees will be subject to a ceiling under an upcoming fiscal management law.

At least 45 people were killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, while hundreds more were treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds.

Mr Netanyahu said the strike was a “tragic mishap” but added: “I don’t intend to end the war before every goal has been achieved.”

He said it was vital that Israel took “every precaution possible” to protect civilians, and insisted that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) were using their “best efforts not to harm those uninvolved” in the conflict.

The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday, at Algeria’s request, to discuss the Rafah strike.

Spain, Ireland and Norway have formally recognised a Palestinian state, in what they say is an attempt to refocus attention on efforts to find a political solution to the war in the Middle East.

They hope by acting together they will encourage other European countries to follow suit, in a diplomatic push that could help secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The symbolic decision has provoked a furious row with Israel’s government which has accused all three countries of rewarding terrorism.

Israel has withdrawn its ambassadors from Ireland, Norway and Spain and formally reprimanded their envoys in Tel Aviv. All three were summoned to Israel’s foreign ministry last week to be shown footage of the 7 October attacks in front of the media.

For all these years the taxation was considered as a part of accountancy not being given its due place. Taxation is a mixture of law, accountancy and economics. It is a distinctive art one has to master. The Chartered Institute of Taxation is the only body incorporated by a parliamentary act specialised to disseminate tax knowledge across the country. Tax education shall not only create the profession of “Tax Consultant” but shall make people tax compliant as well – Chartered Institute of Taxation of Sri Lanka President Ranil Abeywardhene

Anuragumara Dissanayake criticizes the government for not addressing public issues, leading to current challenges. He spoke at a women's conference, emphasizing the need for genuine solutions. Range Bandara suggests holding the presidential election as scheduled but supports giving Ranil Wickremesinghe another term, indicating a lack of viable alternatives. Dissanayake highlights the potential of Sri Lanka, rich in natural resources, yet facing issues like hunger and homelessness, calling for a nation where everyone thrives.

🟩

Anuragumara Dissanayake, the leader of the National People's Power and Member of Parliament, said that if the country had given real answers to the problems of the people, the country would not have met such a fate.

Speaking at the Vavuniya District Women's Conference of the National People's Power, Mr. Dissanayake said this.

Range Bandara has said that the presidential election should be held as planned but that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be given five more years.It means that Ranil only asks for the presidential election without asking anyone else and that they cannot win.

The entire politics of Sri Lanka is a national people's power center.

This country is not the country to begging. This is not a country that people have to suffer. This is not a country that people want to starve, this is a gem with all natural resources, such as a gem and people die without food. There are homeless people. We will build a country where everyone can live together.

### There is no place for the election

*2024-05-29 00:36:11* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/தேர்தலை-பிற்போட-இடமில்லை/175-338056) · `ta`

The presidential election cannot be postponed due to constitutional restrictions, as stated by Keens Nelson from the United People's Power. Palitha Range Bandara, from the United National Party, made incorrect claims about the constitution, prompting calls for him to clarify his statements. The executive president assures protection of the constitution, and any attempts to postpone elections or extend terms would likely fail due to lack of constitutional provisions.

🟩

The presidential election cannot be postponed according to the Constitution. United People's Power MP Keens Nelson said that a referendum could not be held for the presidential election.

He said this at a media briefing held at the Opposition Leader's office on Tuesday (28).

United National Party General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara makes such comments without understanding the constitution.

Before telling this story to the country, Palitha Range Bandara should first point to which section of the Constitution is mentioned.. He urged to avoid publishing such reckless statements.

The executive president of the country gives the promise to protect the Constitution. Palitha Range Bandara is acting as a violation of the Constitution. He said the proposals would definitely defeat if the proposals were brought to postpone the presidential election and the general election for 2 years or to extend their tenure.
