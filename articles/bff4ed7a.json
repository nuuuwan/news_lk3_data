    "(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "On August 6, the Prime Minister despatched me to meet President Gopallawa, and brief him on all the arrangements for the Non-Aligned Conference. The President was always dressed in spotless white cloth and a kind of formal white tunic top. He was simple in his speech, soft spoken and courteous. He also possessed a self-depreciating kind of humour. One day he told me that in 1972, when we became a Republic and the Governor General became President, he used to sometimes telephone someone and say that he was the President speaking, and invariably they asked \u201cPresident of what?\u201d",
    "He obviously derived a great deal of simple amusement from such experiences. But behind his kindness and simplicity lay an acute intelligence, and an ability for unruffled and balanced judgment. This made him an effective non-executive President. The President listened carefully to the briefing; took down a few notes; asked a few questions; and as always, had some useful suggestions to offer. It was always a pleasure to deal with him.",
    "We were now very close to the beginning of the conference and much of our time was spent on conference issues. Whilst Ministries such as the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs functioned as specialized units covering their areas of responsibility, the Prime Minister\u2019s office became a central clearing house for issues coming in from all the concerned Ministries and agencies. Decisions, now had to be taken almost immediately, because otherwise, some important activity would be held up, and that hold up invariably would impinge on other activities in a kind of chain reaction.",
    "It was in this context, that an immediate decision had to be taken on an important security issue. The back up delegations, including the personal security details of various heads of state and government were now flying in. I have already mentioned the nervousness of the Egyptians about President Gaddafi and the Libyan delegation. One night, after an exhausting day for the Prime Minister and most of us, she and I were seated at the long main dining table at Temple Trees at about 11.30 in the night. We were finalizing some urgent matters, which had to be attended to before we could think of sleep.",
    "The telephone switchboard operator buzzed us and said that there was an urgent call from General Attygalle, the Commander of the Army, from the airport at Katunayake. The Prime Minister had ordered the stationing of senior security forces personnel at the airport during this time, and General Attygalle was personally detailed this day because of several important back up and security delegations arriving, including the Libyans. We had obtained and installed special x-ray machines at the airport and all baggage were screened.",
    "General Attygalle\u2019s urgent call was now about the advance Libyan contingent that had arrived and were refusing to have their main baggage x-rayed or examined on grounds of diplomatic immunity. X-rays had already shown that some of the personnel were carrying pistols. They did not want the baggage examined. This had become both a security and a diplomatic issue and the General wished to have instructions as to what to do.",
    "There was no time for committees or consultations. A decision had to be taken immediately. The Prime Minister and I discussed the matter briefly, after which she issued strict instructions that under no circumstances was any single un-xrayed piece of baggage be permitted to be brought in by any delegation or anybody. The Libyans were to be told that they had three options. One was to permit the x-rays and other checks. The second was to keep on the aircraft any baggage which they did not wished checked, and the aircraft to be guarded by the Sri Lankan security forces 24 hours a day until their departure. If they were not agreeable to these, the third option was for the aircraft to be refueled and for them to leave.",
    "General Attygalle was happy. These were clear and unambiguous instructions. He rang off. The time was well past midnight and the Prime Minister appeared to be exceedingly weary. I advised her to get some sleep, and said that I would tell the Temple Trees switchboard to direct any further calls to me at home, and that I would wake her, only if I considered it important enough to do so. She thanked me and agreed. Fortunately, there were only two other calls that night, and both came before I fell asleep. One of them was from General Attygalle to announce that the Libyan\u2019s bags were sent back to the aircraft. This fell in line with option two, which meant that a special guard was placed on that aircraft. So another working day ended, when the next day had already dawned.",
    "We were on a roster to meet and greet the delegations that were flying in for the conference and 8 a.m. to 12 noon on August 7 was my turn to welcome the Foreign Secretaries who were arriving. On the morning of August 9, the large Coordinating Bureau meeting of the conference had its first session. These meetings continued during the afternoon of the following three days. Important procedural and other matters were discussed and agreement reached in time to report to the Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting, which began work on Aug. 12th. The Foreign Ministers themselves met for three days and smoothed out many matters.",
    "All these meetings were at the BMICH. A second Prime Minister\u2019s office was opened in a suite of rooms at the conference hall and I now worked from there. There was a great deal of co-ordination and trouble-shooting to be done. I had to strengthen this office with high quality experienced personnel. Mr. Nihal Jayawickrema, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, and Mr. M. Sanmuganathan, by now Secretary, Constitutional Affairs kindly accepted my invitation to work in the office. They possessed experience, maturity and judgement and were of immense assistance in the large task of general co-ordination.",
    "This arrangement was all the more important since the Prime Minister wanted me to sit in when Heads of State and Government and Foreign Ministers called on her at her own temporarily set up office at the BMICH. Scheduling these appointments and sitting in took a great deal of time, and on practically everyday, we finished well past 1 a.m. As far as my personal schedule was concerned, ever since the beginning of the Co-ordinating Bureau meeting, and until the end of the conference, a period of about 19 days, there wasn\u2019t a single day where I could get to bed before 2 a.m. By 8 a.m. I was back again.",
    "Vernon Mendis was to be the Secretary General of the Conference. He was the Director-General of Foreign Affairs in the Foreign Ministry, the most senior position that could be held by a Foreign Service Officer at the time. Vernon was scholarly, widely read and greatly experienced. He also possessed the confidence, energy and drive to make a success of his formidable new assignment.",
    "The main conference of the Heads of State and Government began on the morning of August 16. The heads of delegations were to be brought in a series of motorcades, from the hotels they were staying, which hotels in fact were completely taken over for the conference, with no other guests permitted. The motorcades consisted of a number of cars, for the heads of delegations, other important members of the delegation and security vehicles. Each motorcade was led by a police pilot car with flashing lights. A",
    "large number of new cars were purchased and brought down for the conference.",
    "Each Head of Delegation had a middle level officer of the Army, Navy or Airforce attached to him or her as a liaison officer who rode in the main car. Each motorcade was to stop at the main porch at the entrance to the hall. From here, after climbing a few steps the Head of State or Government accompanied by his liaison officer smartly turned out, walked along a red carpet towards the main door leading to the foyer of the hall. Near this door stood the Prime Minister to receive the participants. Directly opposite her, on the other side of the red carpet stood a formidable array of photographers and TV camera crews, representing the World\u2019s press and media.",
    "In making the final arrangements, the Prime Minister did not wish to stand alone. There was no Foreign Minister to stand with her because she was also the Foreign Minister. In fact, after discussion and mutual agreement, Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike, had been elected by the countries to Chair the Foreign Ministers meeting in view of the prevailing position in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister, therefore, asked WT Jayasinghe the Foreign Secretary; Dr. Mackie Ratwatte her Private Secretary and myself to stand with her at the entrance to the hall.",
    "Superintendent of Police Leo Perera and his team were in charge of motorcade arrangements and traffic control. The delegations were to arrive according to the alphabetical order of the participating countries. Therefore, President Boumadienne of Algeria, who at the time of writing happened to be the current Chairman of the Nonaligned movement, consequent to the fourth Non-aligned summit held in Algeria, was to arrive first, not because he was Chairman, but according to alphabetical order.",
    "The instructions were that the first motorcade should arrive at the hall at 9 a.m. followed by the others. To the credit of S.P. Leo Perera and his officers, President Boumadienne arrived at the BMICH on the dot at 9 a.m. followed by the others in an unending procession for the next one hour twenty minutes or so. The inauguration of the conference was to be at 11 a.m. which was going to be a short formal session which passed the Chairmanship from Algeria to Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister was due to make her inaugural address, followed by some votes of thanks and then the passing over of the Chairmanship.",
    "Standing by the Prime Minister, we had nothing to do but to watch the impressive spectacle unfolding before our eyes. Yugoslavia had sent a ship that was anchored in the harbour and President Tito and his wife stayed on board, rather than in a hotel. They had also got down a bullet proof Mercedes Benz stretch limousine, for their travel in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi had informed us that she was flying in from Bangalore, and that she could be a bit late, but would try to get in by about 10.30 a.m. Special arrangements were made, the moment she arrived to fly her by helicopter to the Saracens grounds, now the Air Force grounds in Slave Island, from where her motorcade was to commence. Everything went very smoothly. All the delegations had arrived by about 10.15 a.m. except the Indian Prime Minister.",
    "The Prime Minister decided to wait for her. We soon received information from the police that she had arrived and was on her way. At around 10.30 a.m. Mrs. Gandhi arrived, and began walking down the red carpet in her customarily brisk manner. At this point, I was confronted with a totally unexpected and most surprising question. The Prime Minister turned to me and asked with a note of urgency in her voice, \u201cDharmasiri, how do I greet her?\u201d I of course knew that on the previous occasions they had met, they had kissed and greeted each other. The Prime Minister certainly knew that. But the problem seemed to be that she suddenly felt shy to do this in front of literally hundreds of newspaper photographers and TV cameras.",
    "The TV cameras were already rolling and we were bathed in powerful strobe lights. Secretaries to Prime Ministers, no doubt, are compelled to face many unexpected situations during their careers. This was however, one of the most unexpected. There was no time for consultation or contemplation. Mrs. Gandhi was now within a few yards of the Prime Minister. I said \u201cKiss her.\u201d What happened thereafter was spontaneous, and I believe had nothing to do with any advice. The two Prime Ministers naturally and unselfconsciously embraced, and the next morning\u2019s newspapers carried this charming picture on their front pages.",
