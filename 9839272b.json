    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka state run and private bus fare will remain unchanged, officials at the public transport regulator said adding that changes may occur if a significant effect is observed through the fuel price revision.",
    "\u201cAccording to the calculation there should be an increase of 6.42 percent in bus fares,\u201d Shashi Welgama, the Chairman of National Transport Commission said.",
    "\u201cHowever we remember we gave an increase of 20 percent and later it was reduced by 10 percent a few months back. \u201cTherefore by tallying that remaining ten percent increase with the 6.4 percent, we have decided to keep the bus fare unchanged.\u201d",
    "Last year the NTC increased the bus fare by 22 percent in June,2022 before it was reduced earlier this year by 12.9 percent following a fuel price reduction.",
    "However, officials said, the bus fare will be subjected to a revision if the upcoming fuel revision expected next week causes a significant difference in transportation cost.",
    "\u201cIf the fuel price revisions cause more than 4 percent difference to the transportation cost, then the fares will be revised again before the next annual price revision\u201d Aloka Karunarathna, Director Planning of NTC said. (Colombo/June30/2023)"
