    "The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) will hold its monthly lecture tomorrow on the theme \u201cLeopards, people, and everything\u2026\u201d by South African ecologist, researcher, and conservationist Dr. Jeannine Stephanie McManus at 6 p.m. at the Jasmine Hall, BMICH.",
    "The lecture and the topic comes ahead of Sri Lanka Leopard Day which falls on 1 August.",
    "WNPS said Dr. McManus, a global expert in human-wildlife conflict mitigation, will share her insights on fostering human-leopard coexistence in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan leopard, found both inside and outside protected areas, faces increasing challenges that threaten its survival. Dr. McManus\u2019s expertise offers valuable perspectives on addressing these issues.",
    "Dr. McManus is affiliated with the Landmark Foundation, a conservation organisation in South Africa that promotes and facilitates conservation land uses. The leopard is central to the Landmark Foundation owing to its iconic status as the last remaining top predator naturally occurring in South African mountain ranges.",
    "Dr. McManus is a leader in restoration ecology, species conservation, and resolving human-wildlife conflicts. As Acting Director of the Landmark Foundation Leopard and Predator Conservation Project, she has spearheaded initiatives to create wildlife-friendly landscapes and reduce conflicts between humans and carnivores. Her work with the Landmark Foundation includes collaborating with planters and livestock farmers to promote human-leopard coexistence.",
    "The Landmark Foundation has successfully collared and monitored 73 leopards, working closely with farming communities to minimise conflict. Dr. McManus\u2019s extensive experience and dedication to conservation will significantly enhance efforts to protect the Sri Lankan leopard.",
    "In her role as a Research Affiliate at the University of the Western Cape, Dr. McManus supervises students and develops innovative projects in ecology and conservation biology. Her leadership in projects like \u201cShepherding Back Biodiversity\u201d showcases her ability to integrate ecological health with agricultural practices, promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife.",
    "WNPS said Dr. McManus\u2019s extensive experience and passion for conservation will significantly raise awareness and promote the conservation of the Sri Lankan leopard. Her visit could catalyse new conservation initiatives and collaborations, drawing global attention to this magnificent species.",
    "The monthly lecture of the WNPS is supported by Nations Trust Bank. Dr. McManus\u2019s visit is made possible with the kind support of Dilmah Conservation and Jetwing Hotels.",
    "The lecture is open to both members and non-members, with free entrance."
