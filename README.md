### Samagi Jana Sandanaya MPs alleges vote-counting officials violated election law

Samagi Jana Sandanaya MPs Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Patali Champika Ranawaka have lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that some vote-counting officials had violated the election law.

They claimed that some vote-counting officials began calculating second preference votes, prematurely, before receiving official authorisation.

They claimed that a prominent group was behind this violation, raising concerns about the integrity of the counting process.

The move comes after the 2024 Presidential Election Commission announced that no candidate was able to secure an absolute majority, marking the first time in history that a second preference count was required to determine the winner.

Leader of National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake emerged as the front-runner with 42% of the vote, while leader of Samagi Jana Sandanaya followed 32% of the vote.

Speaking to the media, Ranawaka asserted the importance of upholding injustice to his candidate.

### Congratulations and cautionary notes

*2024-09-23 04:35:03* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Congratulations-and-cautionary-notes/4-767003) · `en`

Here’s wishing Anura Kumara Dissanayake heartiest congratulations on behalf of all those bleeding hearts that yearned for systemic change

The ‘too close to call’ Presidential poll has been called and lo, the name of Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) heads all the rest. Case closed, with the pundits who predicted the necessity to appeal to the preferential voting silenced? Perhaps not, for there is cause for proceeding with caution:

In the first flush of a famous victory, AKD and his colleagues may be inclined to interpret their fearless leader’s electoral landslide as incontrovertible proof of his popularity, as much as a mandate to implement the National People’s Power (NPP) manifesto with aplomb and despatch.

But it is best for ‘business as unusual’ to sound a warning note in the bell-like ear of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) stalwart who is now unequivocally Sri Lanka’s tenth Executive President.

All the noise from various parties has now faded, as Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is set to be sworn in as Sri Lanka’s 9th President, marking the change the public has long awaited. Personally, I’m not concerned with what others think; our responsibility remains to work for our children’s future, regardless of who is in power. Both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa allowed rogue elements from Pohottuwa into their ranks, leading to their downfall, while Namal Rajapaksa was a non-factor, as the results clearly showed.

Beneath this diabolic calmness on the surface, the economy is dangerously boiling, heating up gradually every moment without an internally built cooling mechanism and ready for eruption like a volcano

What is the economy which the new President has inherited from the outgoing President? On the surface, it is a more orderly economy compared with the chaos-filled one which Sri Lanka had about two and a half years ago. There are no long queues for essential consumer items like fuel, cooking gas, and basic food items. There are no curse-generating power cuts anymore. Foreign exchange is available to users – both consumers and producers – through banking channels. The foreign exchange black market is virtually non-existent. People are enjoying life travelling locally as well as overseas on holidays or pilgrimages

As per our view, at the upcoming policy meeting, there is an 80% probability for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to maintain rates at the current levels, allowing further strengthening of key economic indicators, say Dimantha Mathew and Anjali Mathews, analysts at First Capital Research.

In their report titled, “The Road ahead: Steering Interest rates in an uncertain economy’. They say, “There is, however, a 20% probability for CBSL to relax the policy rates, with a probability of 15% for a rate cut of 25bps and a lower level of 5% for 50bps rate cut in order to further reduce rates and government security yields to accelerate economic growth.

“Further, there is an 80% probability to keep SRR unchanged; while considering the improved liquidity levels in the system, we consider a 20% probability for a SRR hike of 100bps.”

“My expectation is to treat as sri Lankans without any division all those who placed their trust in me and take the country forward,” Dissanayake said after being declared the winner by the island’s independent Elections Commission.

Sri Lanka is emerging from the worst currency crisis triggered by extreme macroeconomic policy, which ended in sovereign default.

Despite the lack of war Sri Lanka began to experience severe balance of payments troubles from 2011 as the central bank printed money to target short term rates within a policy corridor and also narrowed it.

### Sri Lanka’s President by default loses for third time after tough economic reforms

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who rose to the helm through a parliament vote two years back, has lost the presidential election for the third time in the Saturday poll after implementing two years of tough and unpopular economic reforms including tax hikes and state-owned enterprise restructuring.

Wickremesinghe lost the 2020 parliament election, but became a legislator in 2021 through a solitary national list vacancy his party secured in the poll.

He accepted the challenge of resurrecting a bankrupt economy in 2022 after former leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa invited him to take over as the Sri Lankan Prime Minister for the sixth time.

After he was elected as the parliament through a parliament vote, he stubbornly implemented some unpalatable economic reforms under an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led bailout package.
