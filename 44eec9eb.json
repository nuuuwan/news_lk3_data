    "In\u00a0 1976 Premier Bandaranaike received a telephone call from the US\u00a0 government, warning that if Prof. Bibile was not removed and his policy\u00a0 withdrawn the US would stop the provisions of PL480 aid for Sri Lanka to\u00a0 obtain wheat flour",
    "While President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka\u00a0 Podujana Peramuna government are acting effectively to pull Sri Lanka\u00a0 out of the debt trap and the worst economic crisis since independence,\u00a0 the vital public health service is on the brink of collapse\u2014which means\u00a0 the poor people will die, and the rich will live.",
    "The public health service was strengthened in 1971 when\u00a0 Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2019s government implemented the Senaka\u00a0 Bibile principles which was done by one of the world\u2019s respected\u00a0 prophetic pharmacologists Prof. Senaka Bibile with the assistance of Dr.\u00a0 S. A. Wickremesinghe who was also the leader of the Sri Lanka Communist\u00a0 Party.",
    "For more than five years the Bibile principles were\u00a0 implemented effectively, and the people were able to get quality\u00a0 medicinal drugs at affordable prices. Under these plans the State\u00a0 Pharmaceutical Corporation was set up and also the State Pharmaceutical\u00a0 Manufacturing Corporation. One of Prof. Bibile\u2019s intentions was to\u00a0 manufacture good quality drugs in Sri Lanka and thus ensure not only\u00a0 the quality but also save foreign exchange, which would have prevented\u00a0 Sri Lanka from going bankrupt as we did in April last year.",
    "In a rare feature, Prof. Bible was not only the Chairman of\u00a0 the SPC but also the head of its trade union. Those who worked closely\u00a0 with him would often see him sit on the floor and help pack the drugs\u00a0 which were imported loose. His principles were quality, safety,\u00a0 efficacy, the cost of the drug and the need for it.",
    "At that time Sri Lanka imported about 500 drugs but after\u00a0 Prof. Bibile was forced to leave we now import about 12,000 varieties of\u00a0 drugs including more than 50 varieties of antibiotics ranging from amoxicillin which the SPC now sells around Rs. 10 to other brands which\u00a0 costs around Rs. 70 to Rs. 100. Though Prof. Bibile put a limit of 500\u00a0 on the number of drugs imported things have changed and we could put the\u00a0 limit at 1,000 drugs. But 12,000 is a huge waste of money and perhaps one\u00a0 of the reasons for our bankruptcy.",
    "Among the many mafias, the pharma-mafia is known to be one\u00a0 of the most powerful. So powerful that in the United States, the pharma\u00a0 mafia was able to force the US government to get rid of Prof. Bibile. In\u00a0 1976 Premier Bandaranaike received a telephone call from the US\u00a0 government, warning that if Prof. Bibile was not removed and his policy\u00a0 withdrawn the US would stop the provisions of PL480 aid for Sri Lanka to\u00a0 obtain wheat flour. The Prime Minister called Prof. Bibile and in turn,\u00a0 asked his pharmacological assistant to join him to see the Premier. He\u00a0 had told Prof. Balasubramaniyam \u201cI think we are finished,\u201d. As expected\u00a0 Ms. Bandaranaike told Prof. Bibile while she had great respect for him\u00a0 and his policies she had no option but to ask him to leave.",
    "So one of modern medicine\u2019s great prophets left the country\u00a0 and went to South America where he worked for the United Nations\u00a0 organisation. Years later he died there in mysterious circumstances and\u00a0 eminent personalities such Prof. Carlo Fonseka, former chairman of the\u00a0 National Council for Higher Education, believe Prof. Bibile was killed.",
    "In early 2000 the People\u2019s Movement for the Rights of\u00a0 Patients (PMRP) filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme\u00a0 Court which said the people\u2019s fundamental rights were being violated\u00a0 with the withdrawal of the Senaka Bibile policy. The case dragged down\u00a0 for years and the then opposition parties including the United National\u00a0 Party (UNP) promised they would restore the Senaka Bibile policy if they\u00a0 were elected to office. Indeed they did when the Yahapalanaya government\u00a0 led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe came to\u00a0 office in 2015. Prof. Bibile\u2019s key policy was setting up of the high-powered National Medicinal Drugs Authority (NMRA).",
    "But Sri Lanka\u2019s mafias are powerful and there are reports\u00a0 that some 40 drug company managers met a leading politician where each\u00a0 of them gave him Rs. 25 million. It was supposed to be for campaign\u00a0 funding but it is clear to whom and for what the huge sum was used.\u00a0 These are the roots of the current public health service crisis, and\u00a0 President Wickremesinghe needs to use surgical equipment to battle the\u00a0 drug mafia."
