    "Creativity is a driving force behind business growth and cultural influence. Jonathan Joseph, an AOD graduate, exemplifies how Sri Lankan design talent can shape both local and international markets through strategic, commercially-minded creativity.",
    "A graduate of AOD\u2019s BA (Hons) Graphics and Visual Communication Design program, awarded by Northumbria University UK, Jonathan began his journey with the AOD Foundation program, which provided a solid platform for his creative and entrepreneurial development. Today, he runs his own design studio, specialising in brand identity and packaging, and is evolving his practice into Brandkind, a multidisciplinary agency with ambitions to serve global markets across branding, packaging, 3D, and digital design.",
    "Jonathan\u2019s portfolio includes projects that resonate deeply with Sri Lankan consumers, from FMCG products to leading tea brands. His rebranding of the national energy drink RIDE revitalised its identity, positioning it competitively on the global stage. In the tea sector, Jonathan has transformed packaging for over 11 brands, including Tea Avenue, Hyson Tea, Tea Tang, and Cassandra Organics crafted for Dubai supermarkets with vibrant visuals that merge Sri Lankan heritage with international retail sensibilities.",
    "These projects demonstrate how AOD graduates like Jonathan combine cultural authenticity with global appeal, enabling Sri Lankan products to travel seamlessly across borders.",
    "Jonathan\u2019s work extends beyond local brands to collaborations with global leaders such as Google, Visa, Prudential, and Workday, reflecting the versatility instilled by AOD. He has also represented Sri Lanka at Young Spikes Asia, a platform celebrating the region\u2019s top young creative talent, illustrating how AOD prepares designers to compete on an international scale.",
    "Jonathan\u2019s achievements mirror AOD\u2019s philosophy of blending creativity with entrepreneurship. The program\u2019s combination of hands-on learning, mentorship, and real-world client exposure provided him with the confidence to launch his studio immediately after graduation. As Jonathan reflects:",
    "\u201cAOD allowed me to embrace independence, creativity, and confidence to build my practice the way I envisioned it. The exposure to real-world projects and mentorship gave me the courage to launch my studio right after graduation.\u201d",
    "This foundation has been pivotal in Jonathan\u2019s evolution from a young graduate to a global-minded entrepreneur.",
    "Jonathan\u2019s journey highlights how AOD nurtures talent into tangible industry success. Graduates are equipped not only with creative expertise but also strategic and entrepreneurial skills that allow them to lead projects, innovate in business contexts, and compete internationally. Through AOD, Jonathan learned to approach design as a strategic tool, creating work that drives both cultural relevance and commercial impact."
