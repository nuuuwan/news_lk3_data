Essential drug shortage looms due to flawed import process. Government urged to improve procurement procedures to prevent deficits. Insulin, cancer drugs, and biochemicals may face scarcity.

üü©

The Federation of Medical and Civil Rights Association said that the country's health structure is likely to cause shortage of essential drugs.

The situation is expected to be due to the lack of proper purchase procedure for importing drugs.

When a new year begins, the Ministry of Health should make a request for the purchase of medicine for the year.

However, due to the weakness of the last government and the arrest of many health department officials in the past, there has been a major setback in the process of pharmaceutical regulation, purchase and distribution.

As a result, according to the data of the medical distribution unit, there will be massive drug shortages next year.

Accordingly, insulin, cancer drugs and some biochemical drugs are also scarce.

Therefore, the government should take steps to avoid the proper procurement procedures and take steps to avoid massive deficits, said Dr. Samal Sanjeeva, Secretary of the Federation of Medical and Civil Rights.R
