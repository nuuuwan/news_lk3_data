### IMF urges Asian Central Banks to not follow Fed too closely

*2024-04-19 13:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/IMF-urges-Asian-Central-Banks-to-not-follow-Fed-too-closely/108-280993) · `en`

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged Asian Central Banks to not follow the Fed too closely.

IMF Director of the Asia and Pacific Department Krishna Srinivasan this week recommended Asian Central Banks to focus on domestic inflation and avoid making their positive decisions overly dependent on anticipated moves by the Federal Reserve.

“ If central banks follow the Fed too closely, they could undermine price stability in their own countries,” Srinivasan said, addressing a press briefing on Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific.

IMF staff analysis shows that U.S. interest rates have a strong and immediate impact on Asian financial conditions and exchange rates. The Fund noted that expectations about Fed easing have fluctuated in recent months, driven by factors that are unrelated to Asian price stability needs.

### India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election

Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India’s marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world’s most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India’s secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.

### Sri Lanka rupee quoted wide to US dollar as peg inconsistencies flare up

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee opened wide at 301.50/302.50 to the US dollar Friday, as was quoted even wider at 301/303 to the dollar in early trade, dealers said, as dollar demand resumed following a 715 million dollar purchase of forex by the central bank in March.

Sri Lanka has a deeply flawed non-floating ad hoc soft-peg arrangement found in all defaulting IMF advised countries, with inconsistent policies where external and domestic anchors conflict, critics have pointed out.

In May 2023, after the central bank collected 666 million dollars amid panic sales by market participants when inconsistent peg was allowed to appreciate to 295 to the US dollar from 321 in April, the rupee came under pressure in the following two months.

As the inconsistencies of the deadly flexible exchange rate clash, the rupee is quoted wide, spot trading disappears, moral suasion comes in and the spot next and one week market becomes active.

### India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election

(CNN) - Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India’s marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world’s most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India’s secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.

Under Modi’s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power.

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - A request by some MPs across the political divide for concessionary vehicle permits is likely to be shot down by the party leaders given the dire economic situation of the country, Daily Mirror learns.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne brought to the notice of the Business Committee last week that a letter is being signed by the MPs for such a request.

He said such a request would tarnish the honorary services of the MPs and therefore such facility should not be granted to them in adherence to due protocols as in the case of other public servants and judicial officers.

However, SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said at the same meeting that such a request should not be entertained at all due to what they called bankruptcy of the country.

The Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) known in English as the Federal Party will celebrate its 75th birthday in December this year. The premier political party of the Sri Lankan Tamil people known as “Ilankai Thamizhar” in their mother tongue was born on 18 December 1949. On that day, a group of 60 Tamils including two parliamentarians and two senators convened at the Government Clerical Service Union (GCSU) hall in Colombo.

That historic conclave resulted in the launching of a new political party with the avowed goal of establishing an autonomous State for the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known then) within a united island. The new party was named in Tamil as “Illankai Thamil Arasu Katchi” meaning Ceylon Tamil State or Tamil Government Party.

Prices for necessities were soaring, the unemployment rate was rising, and the public’s despondency deepened while facing shortages of nearly everything. The future looked very bleak for many. While some people got onto the streets out of desperation, another group of smart individuals who were passionate about getting India’s economy back on track, worked relentlessly to find solutions to their economic issues, which had a transformative effect on India to become the regional powerhouse it is today.

Stresses combating corruption would attract foreign direct investments through increased investor confidence

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday claimed that the Government’s hesitance to establish an effective anti-corruption framework, as demanded by sovereign bondholders, stems from its own corrupt practices.

He noted that this has caused a delay in the disbursement of the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in reaching an agreement with international sovereign bondholders.
