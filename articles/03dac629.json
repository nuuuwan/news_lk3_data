    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Vietnam can grow 6.0 percent in 2024, with \u2018policy support\u2019 but there is a debate whether it should be done through fiscal (widening deficits/worsening debt or state spending) or monetary means, a top International Monetary Fund official said.",
    "The IMF projects 6.0 percent growth for Vietnam in 2024 \u201cas it rebounds from a challenging 2023,\u201d Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department told reporters during the Spring Meetings in Washington.",
    "\u201cNow, in the case of Vietnam, I would say that there\u2019s an issue about policy mix, whether you could get more support from the fiscal and rely less on monetary,\u201d Srinivasan said.",
    "\u201cSo there is an issue of policy mix which we\u2019re talking, which we\u2019ve been engaging the authorities with.",
    "\u201cI would say that policy support should be more favorable and that should, and along with external demand, help raise growth to 6 percent.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka used both fiscal and monetary mix to boost growth from December 2019, triggering an external default two and a half years later.",
    "Vietnam\u2019s forex reserves fell below 3 months of imports in 2022 after the State Bank kept policy rates down by inflationary sterilization of forex market interventions.",
    "The currency was the stabilized with rapid fire rate hikes and credit controls to dial back inflationary policy, just as long fuel ques started to form at petrol sheds, with angry riders already hit by rising prices due to Done weakness averting wider social unrest from depreciation.",
    "The State Bank of Vietnam later cut rates and relaxed credit controls as the BOP shifted to a surplus.",
    "The government has since cut value added taxes. Public sector salaries are set to rise further this year, after earlier wage restraint.",
    "The IMF also agreed in an Article IV consultation report released in October 2023, that fiscal metrics could be undermined for \u2018growth\u2019 but more through income re-distribution, and possible support for fallouts from a weak property sector.",
    "Some Vietnamese property companies are reeling from expansion during earlier low rates and Covid linked construction delays, which could also hit banks.",
    "\u201cBuilding on successful fiscal consolidation in recent years, there is fiscal space to provide further support,\u201d an IMF Article IV consultation report released in October 2023 said.",
    "\u201cThe government could scale up social safety nets that would boost growth and protect the most vulnerable households.",
    "\u201cGiven the slowdown and the constraints faced by monetary policy, going forward, fiscal policy can take a leading role in supporting aggregate demand.",
    "\u201cFor instance, the government could scale up social safety nets\u2014and consider cash transfers to provide swift relief to poorer households.",
    "\u201cIf the current turmoil proves more damaging to the economy and the financial sector, targeted support could be considered, including to help real estate developers restructure.\u201d",
    "In 2023 the balance of payments has been only marginally in surplus by 1 to 3 billion dollars a quarter, indicating that credit was still resilient after a successful \u2018soft-landing\u2019, and any further shock can de-stabilize the external sector easily.",
    "In the fourth quarter of 2024, Vietnam\u2019s BOP, was only 2.4 billion in surplus.",
    "Any extra spending or tax cuts which boosts the deficit due to attempts to engage in \u2018macro-economic policy\u2019 which widens the deficit and expand government borrowings would lead to money printing under a fixed policy rate, reversing gains made by the State Bank over 2023, and pushing the dong down, analysts say.",
    "Western macro-economists believe that expanding government action (through the Treasury or central banks) to tinker with \u2018aggregate demand\u2019 can boost growth numbers instead of giving a chance for people and businesses to engage in real production of goods and services by providing monetary stability.",
    "Such Keynesian and post-Keynesian beliefs have worsened since quantitative easing was normalized in the US after the Great Recession and \u2018stimulus\u2019 re-captured Western media attention despite the hard lessons of the 1960s and 1970s.",
    "In Sri Lanka the IMF taught a central bank that had already busted the currency from 4.70 to 131 to the dollar to calculate \u2018potential output\u2019 just as the country was barely recovering from a 30-year civil war.",
    "Sri Lanka defaulted within 7 years of \u2018data driven monetary policy\u2019 (flexible inflation targeting with output gap targeting) and three currency crises later in peacetime amid increasingly aggressive macro-economic policy as consecutive stabilization programs reduced growth numbers.",
    "After using higher deficits and inflationary rate cuts in 2015 amid low inflation, inflationary rate cuts despite tax hikes in 2018 (fiscal policy is tight therefore monetary has to be loose mantra), macro-economists took a proverbial Keynesian bull by the horns and cut both taxes and rates from December 2019 saying there was a \u2018persistent output gap\u2019.",
    "Analysts says there is no real choice between monetary or fiscal deterioration of achieve macro-economic policy desires of interventionists in a country with a bureaucratic interest rate.",
    "A policy rate, unless hiked, will automatically result in inflationary monetary operations as domestic credit picks up, irrespective of whether it is driven by private or state credit.",
    "Any so-called \u2018fiscal support\u2019 can only be given without harming the exchange rate in a country that has a reserve collecting central bank with a policy rate, by liquidating any sovereign wealth funds or borrowing abroad and pushing up net external debt, analysts say.",
    "By worsening external net debt levels, desires of macro-economists can be satisfied without harming monetary stability and the living standards of the population in general or nutrition of the children of the poorest sections of society by so-called exchange rate flexibility or debasement.",
    "In Sri Lanka targeting potential output is now written into a brand new IMF backed monetary law even before the first default workout is complete. (Colombo/Apr20/2024)"
