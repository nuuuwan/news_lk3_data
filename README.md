ඒ අනුව ගාල්ල, වලහන්දූව ප්‍රදේශයේ පදිංචි සෙනුක දේශාන් නම් සිසුවෙක් පසුගිය මාර්තු 18 වනදා සිට අතුරුදන්ව සිටී.

තමන් ඉන් බේරුණු නමුත් පෙම්වතා දියේ ගිලුණු බව ඇය පොලීසියට පවසා තිබුණි.

කෙසේවෙතත්  අවස්ථා කිහිපයකදී සිද්ධිය පිළිබඳ පොලීසියට පැමිණිළි කර ඇති සෙනුකගේ ඥාතීන්ට පෙම්වතිය පවසන කරුණු පිළිබඳව පවතින්නේ සැකයකි.

### Building expressways is a myth till debt restructuring process completed: Bandula

Colombo, April 02 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said today that completing the expressway structure of the country has become a myth till the debt restructuring process is finalized.

"Even I hope of completing the expressway system in the country as soon as possible. But we are unable to get loans until the debt restructuring process is finalized," he said.

"We can only think of completing expressways after the debt restructuring process of the Road Development Authority (RDA) is completed," he further said.

Moreover, he said there is no truth in handing over the daily operations and management of highways to a private company.

The Ministry had approved the transfer of daily operations and management of expressways from the Road Development Authority (RDA) to a state-owned company called Sahasya Investments (SIL).

SIL is a 100 percent state-owned company under the Treasury and the RDA.

Israel has long denied it is hindering the distribution of urgently needed food aid in Gaza, saying the problem is caused by the inability of international aid groups to get it to those in need.

Despite co-ordinating movements with the Israeli Defence Force, the convoy was hit as it was leaving its Deir al-Balah warehouse, after unloading more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza by sea, WCK said.
