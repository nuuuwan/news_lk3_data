    "In view of Sri Lanka Leopard Day, which fell yesterday, conservationists urge the country to look beyond the leopard\u2019s beauty and ecological value \u2014 and recognize its massive contribution to the economy.",
    "From Yala\u2019s parched trails to the lush hills of the Central Highlands, the Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) powers an entire web of livelihoods. According to the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), the loss of a single leopard can cost the country an estimated Rs. 41 million in lost revenue \u2014 a sobering figure that highlights the animal\u2019s importance far beyond protected areas.",
    "The leopard is not just an apex predator. It is a cornerstone of rural economies, fueling national parks, eco-tourism, safari operators, guides, hotels, jeep drivers, souvenir vendors and thousands of families who depend on wildlife tourism.",
    "The WNPS notes that in places like Yala, leopards are the central attraction for both domestic and international visitors. This demand supports a significant portion of the informal and formal economies in surrounding communities.",
    "In recent years, boutique accommodations, homestays, artisanal products and wildlife photography experiences have flourished \u2014 all rooted in the presence of the leopard. \u201cEntire micro-economies have evolved around the leopard, WNPS states, \u201cand these are often the only source of income for communities living on the edge of conservation zones.\u201d",
    "Despite the leopard\u2019s iconic status, killings are now reported even outside protected areas. Many fall victim to snares, poisoning or retaliation for perceived livestock attacks. According to the WNPS, these threats are increasing and enforcement remains weak.",
    "With the death of each leopard, not only is a species pushed closer to extinction \u2014 but a chain of livelihoods and economic opportunities collapses.",
    "The WNPS estimates the Rs. 41 million figure by factoring in park entry fees, accommodation revenues, employment and related tourism services directly or indirectly tied to leopard sightings. This amount reflects lost national income, not to mention the long-term damage to Sri Lanka\u2019s global wildlife tourism reputation.",
    "In response, the WNPS-LOLC Multi-Regional Leopard Conservation Project is scaling up its efforts to protect leopards across multiple landscapes. The project supports scientific monitoring, habitat mapping, community outreach and ground-level conservation in high-risk areas beyond national parks.",
    "Crucially, the WNPS is urging businesses and brands that profit from wildlife tourism to view conservation not as a charitable gesture, but as a strategic investment in their own sustainability.",
    "\u201cThis is not about sentiment, the WNPS emphasizes. \u201cThis is about protecting a national economic asset. Leopard conservation is directly tied to local income, food security and long-term resilience in rural economies.\u201d",
