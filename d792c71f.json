  "original_body_lines": [
    "OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman will return as boss just days after he was fired by the board, the firm has said.",
    "The agreement \u201cin principle\u201d involves new board members being appointed, the tech company added. It comes after\u00a0 Altman was sacked on Friday triggering an open letter from staff who threatened to resign unless he was reinstated.",
    "\u201cI am looking forward to returning to OpenAI,\u201d\u00a0 Altman said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. He added: \u201cI love OpenAI, and everything I\u2019ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together. He added the firm would build on its \u201cstrong partnership with Microsoft.\u201d",
    "Last week, the board decided to remove\u00a0 Altman, which led to co-founder Greg Brockman\u2019s resignation, sending the star AI company into chaos.",
    "The decision was made by the three non-employee board members, Adam D\u2019Angelo, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, and a third co-founder and the firm\u2019s chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. But on Monday Sutskever apologised on X, and signed the staff letter calling on the board to reverse course.",
    "Microsoft, the biggest investor in OpenAI, then offered Altman a job leading \u201ca new advanced AI research team\u201d at the tech giant.",
    "On Wednesday, OpenAI said it had agreed Mr Altman\u2019s return to the tech company in principle, and that it would partly reconstitute the board of directors that had dismissed him.",
    "Former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers will join current director Adam D\u2019Angelo, OpenAI said.In a post on X,\u00a0 Mr Brockman also said he would be returning to the firm.",
    "Emmett Shear, who had been appointed OpenAI\u2019s interim chief executive, said he was \u201cdeeply pleased\u201d by Mr Altman\u2019s return after about \u201c72 very intense hours of work\u201d. \u201cComing into OpenAI, I wasn\u2019t sure what the right path would be,\u201dhe said on X,\u00a0 but added that Mr Altman\u2019s reinstatement \u201cwas the pathway that maximized safety alongside doing right by all stakeholders involved\u201d.",
    "Microsoft boss Satva Nadella said the firm was \u201cencouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board\u201d. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Microsoft has heavily invested in OpenAI, but its links do not extend to the boardroom.",
    "The battle at the top of OpenAI began suddenly on Friday when the then board announced it was firing\u00a0 Altman, saying it had \u201clost confidence\u201d in his leadership. It accused him of not being \u201cconsistently candid in his communications\u201d though what it was that he was allegedly not candid about remains unclear.",
    "This then led to nearly all of OpenAI\u2019s more-than-700 staff to sign an open letter threatening to leave unless the board resigned. The letter stated that Microsoft, had assured them that there were jobs for all OpenAI staff if they wanted to join the company.",
    "However, late on Tuesday it became clear that negotiations were underway focused on enabling Mr Altman to return.",
    "But the upheaval of the past few days has raised questions about how a group of just four people could make decisions that have rocked a multi-billion dollar technology business.",
    "In part this is because of OpenAI\u2019s unusual structure and purpose.",
    "It began life in 2015 as a non-profit \u2013 many charities have that status \u2013 with the mission to create \u201csafe artificial general intelligence that benefits all of humanity\u201d. The mission, did not include looking after the interests of shareholders.",
    "In 2019 it added a for-profit subsidiary but its purpose remained unchanged and the not-for-profit\u2019s board remained in charge.",
    "The board members involved in Altman\u2019s dismissal have yet to explain their decision \u2013 Elon Musk is among those who have urged members to \u201csay something\u201d.",
    "But that has yet to happen. In reaction to the news of the reinstatement and new board, on X Ms Toner posted just \u201cand now we can all get some sleep\u201d.",
