ЁЯЯй

The current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has failed to fulfill anything that has promised the nation before the presidential election, said Mr. Jivan Thondaman, the general secretary of the Ceylon Workers Congress and the Nuwara Eliya district team candidate of the United National Alliance.

Jeevan Thondaman made this statement at a media briefing that Kotagala was held on Saturday (26) at the headquarters of the Ceylon Workers Congress.

He also said that the cost of rice, eggs and coconut has increased the cost of the people of the country.

The current president has failed to control it and the cost of living has greatly affected the plantation people.

Tamil MPs should be in Parliament to represent the plantation people in the 2024 general election as the current president has not made any comments on the plantation population.

### An important strategy to mitigate elephant-vehicle collisions

*2024-10-27 01:48:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/an-important-strategy-to-mitigate-elephant-vehicle-collisions/) ┬╖ `en`

(Author of the award-winning book тАЬThe Life of Last Proboscideans: ElephantsтАЭ)

According to a report by the World Bank, Sri Lanka has the highest road density in South Asia. On the other hand, Sri Lanka is a country with rich biodiversity and wildlife-collisions with trains/motorists have been there for aeons without a successful mitigating measure. This can risk the lives of wildlife as well as motorists or passengers. The latest one happened on October 18, 2024, in which two wild elephants died and two others were injured in a Batticaloa-bound fuel tanker train accident.

When considering train accidents, the best solutions would be an underground railway-transit line in wildlife-sensitive areas. But considering the economic status of the country, such projects can be difficult to initiate in the near future. So, this article proposes a strategy that can be implemented just within a few days and has a strong potential to at least mitigate the issue.

The book tries to make its contribution to our society, its continuing relevance, clearer. It does this by exploring its historical evolution from multiple perspectives.

It also raises many questions. Perhaps the most important of them is this: how do institutions become relevant to the societies they inhabit, how do they become more representative of the people they serve?

To answer that question, it is necessary to go back in time.

SudanтАЩs paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) killed at least 124 people in a village in El Gezira State on Friday, activists said, in one of the deadliest incidents of an 18-month war and largest in a spate of attacks in the state.

Following the surrender of high-ranking RSF officer Abuagla Keikal to the army last Sunday, pro-democracy activists said the RSF has carried out revenge attacks in the farming state where he comes from, killing and detaining civilians and displacing thousands.

Gezira has already faced a months-long rampage in which residents told Reuters the RSF looted homes, killed scores of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands.

Al-Sireha village, in the north of the state, experienced the worst of the recent violence when at least 124 were killed and 100 injured in the RSF raid, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, a pro-democracy group, said on Saturday.

I met Barbara Harrel-Bond, an anthropologist, by accident in April 1989. At that time, I was with the USAID-funded Mahaweli Agriculture and Rural Development Project (MARD). One day at lunchtime, an old jeep arrived at the project office. A white woman in her sixties emerged from the jeep. She was in a kurta and was carrying several notebooks in her hands. She smiled and asked me whether I could find someone who knew how Sinhala villagers interacted with Tamil villagers in the war-front area. I told her our professional staff had gone out for lunch, so she should wait until they returned.
