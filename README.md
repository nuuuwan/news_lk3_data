Basil Rajapakse, the founder of the PA, said that the announcement of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's contesting as an independent candidate was completely wrong.

The executive committee of the PA was chaired by former President Mahinda Rajapakse to take a final decision on the presidential candidate.

It has been paid attention to a member of the PA in the presidential election and the candidature of President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the candidate.

One party has stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be fielded as presidential candidate and another party should field a member of the party as the presidential candidate.

It is absolutely wrong to announce that he is contesting as an independent candidate as he is in talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the issue of the presidential candidate.

We supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022 without any conditions. But for the past 2 years, he has not given priority to the PA's party.
