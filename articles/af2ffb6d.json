    "Sri Lanka\u2019s largest industrial exporter, the apparel sector, saw its performance for the whole of 2023 dip significantly, with its earnings contracting by 19 percent year-on-year (YoY).",
    "The local apparel sector saw its export revenue for 2023 reach US $ 4.5 billion. This is an improvement when compared with US $ 4.15 billion fetched in 2020, the year of the pandemic but a contraction when compared with the performance recorded in 2021 and 2022.

With November 2023 too having recorded a 12.4 percent MoM growth from October 2023, the improvement signals the possibility of the order books slowly but steadily increasing, especially with the seasonal demand.",
    "Speaking to Mirror Business, Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Secretary General Yohan Lawrence said the industry expects 2024 to remain relatively flat, with some growth later in the year.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that the offer from Sri Lanka remains price competitive, making positive steps in trade facilitation to avoid losing to competitor countries,\u201d he said.",
    "The competitors such as Bangladesh, for example, saw revenue from apparel expand by around 3 percent in 2023, while Sri Lanka lost 20 percent.",
    "Apparel is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest industrial export and it earned US $ 5.95 billion in 2022. The country\u2019s apparel sector has about 300,000 employees, most of whom are women."
