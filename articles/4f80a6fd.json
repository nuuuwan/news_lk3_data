    "Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran early on Wednesday morning, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fuelled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.",
    "The Palestinian Islamist militant group and Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards confirmed Haniyeh\u2019s death. The Guards said it took place hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for Iran\u2019s new president.",
    "Although the strike on Haniyeh was widely assumed to have been carried out by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government made no claim of responsibility and said it would make no comment on the killing.",
    "Haniyeh was killed by a missile that hit him \u201cdirectly\u201d in a state guesthouse where he was staying, senior Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya told a news conference in Tehran, quoting witnesses who were with Haniyeh.",
    "Haniyeh, normally based in Qatar, had been the face of Hamas\u2019 international diplomacy as the war set off by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 has raged in Gaza. He had been taking part in internationally brokered indirect talks on reaching a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.",
    "Netanyahu made no mention of Haniyeh\u2019s killing in a televised statement on Wednesday evening but said Israel had delivered crushing blows to Iran\u2019s proxies of late, including Hamas and Hezbollah, and would respond forcefully to any attack.",
    "\u201cWe are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined against any threat. Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from any arena,\u201d he said.",
    "The latest events appear to set back chances of any imminent ceasefire agreement in the nearly 10-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and the Iran-backed Hamas.",
    "Hamas\u2019 armed wing said in a statement Haniyeh\u2019s killing would \u201ctake the battle to new dimensions and have major repercussions\u201d. Vowing to retaliate, Iran declared three days of national mourning and said the U.S. bore responsibility because of its support for Israel.",
    "In Turkey, thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through the streets of central Istanbul late on Wednesday to protest Haniyeh\u2019s killing.",
    "Protesters in Istanbul\u2019s Fatih district held posters with Haniyeh\u2019s photo, chanted \u201cmurderer Israel, get out of Palestine\u201d and waved Turkish and Palestinian flags.",
    "Washington expressed concern about the potential for escalation. But White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. did not see that as imminent or inevitable and was working to prevent it from happening.",
    "The risks \u201care certainly up right now. They don\u2019t make the task of de-escalation, deterrence and dissuasion - which is the goal - any less complicated,\u201d he told reporters.",
    "The U.S. advised citizens not to travel to Lebanon, and two U.S. airlines, United and Delta, paused flights to Tel Aviv.",
    "The assassination occurred less than 24 hours after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah\u2019s most senior military commander in retaliation for a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.",
    "Hezbollah confirmed that senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed by an Israeli airstrike in a Beirut suburb.",
    "Seven people were killed and 78 wounded in the Beirut strike, Lebanese network Tele Liban reported on Wednesday, citing the civil defence authority. Iranian state media said an Iranian military adviser was among the dead.",
    "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel had provided the grounds for \u201charsh punishment for itself\u201d and it was Tehran\u2019s duty to avenge Haniyeh\u2019s death.",
    "Iranian forces have already made strikes directly on Israel earlier in the Gaza war.",
    "Haniyeh\u2019s most likely successor is Khaled Meshaal, his deputy-in-exile who lives in Qatar, analysts and Hamas officials said.",
    "Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer told journalists that Israel was committed to Gaza ceasefire negotiations and securing the release of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza.",
    "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Singapore, sidestepped a question on Haniyeh\u2019s killing, saying a ceasefire deal in Gaza was key to avoiding wider regional escalation. He told Channel News Asia that the U.S. had neither been aware of nor involved in the killing.",
    "Qatar, which along with Egypt has been brokering talks aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza, condemned Haniyeh\u2019s killing.",
    "\u201cHow can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?\u201d Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on X.",
    "In Washington, Kirby said the ceasefire process had not been \u201ccompletely torpedoed,\u201d adding that \u201cwe still believe the deal on the table is worth pursuing.\u201d",
    "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas-led fighters on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, Israeli tallies say.",
    "Nearly 10 months of Israel\u2019s onslaught in the coastal enclave has killed more than 39,400 people, according to Gaza health officials, and left more than 2 million in a humanitarian crisis.",
    "While the mood was buoyant in Israel, residents in besieged Gaza feared Haniyeh\u2019s death would prolong the fighting.",
    "\u201cThis news is scary. We feel that he was like a father to us,\u201d said Gaza resident Hachem Al-Saati."
