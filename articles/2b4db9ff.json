    "Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Arun Hemachandra recently told Ada Derana TV that Sri Lanka would receive a lot of positive news after President Anura Kumara Disanayake\u2019s visit to India.He made this comment during a talk show with TV anchor Mahieash Johnney in a zoom call.",
    "Mahieash asked the deputy foreign minister several questions related to the President\u2019s visit to India from December 15 to 17, which is set to take place following an invitation from the Indian government.",
    "The following are some comments made by the deputy foreign minister during the programme.",
    "\u201cAs a country, we do believe in maintaining good bilateral relations. Sri Lanka is an island nation. Our country is situated in an important geographical location on the world map. So, as a country, we do need a very strong foreign relations and we should have a very strong diplomatic service as well. Based on that, what we believe is that the NPP government should have a very strong foreign policy and we are committed to having one. In the past, as a country, we did not have a similar thing because most of the rulers were making use of the foreign diplomatic service as well as the foreign policy which was supposed to be nation-oriented or country-oriented, but were not practiced in that way.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs the NPP-led government, we are committed to a very strong foreign policy. We have to understand one thing. India being a very close neighbour, India being a very strong neighbour and India being a country that helped Sri Lanka during the crisis time without any conditions, we have to maintain a very close relationship with India. And, we have to understand that our country should have a very strong, non-aligned foreign policy, so as a country, we need to understand that it is an art of balancing. We have to consider India\u2019s national security which is their utmost concern. We should focus on that also because being a very strong country, they focus on that. But also, we have to have a very strong country oriented and people-oriented foreign policy, so the NPP government is committed to having such a policy, so there is nothing to worry about that.\u201d",
    "When asked about Sri Lanka\u2019s wish to join BRICS as a means of economic development and about US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose 100% tax on BRICS\u2019s exports into his country if they created a new currency to replace the US dollar, Hemachandra said said,\u201d Our application to join BRICS has not been rejected. It is still under consideration. As a country, we have joined the new development bank \u2013 which is the banking body of BRICS, so the process is still on the move.",
    "And about the statement made by the U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, we don\u2019t know how practical it is for them to impose such tariff. But then again, we have to understand that BRICS was something inevitable because it was something which couldn\u2019t be rejected , so there was a need for BRICS and that was one reason BRICS kept on growing. So, we have not opted out, we have not changed our decision on BRICS. The particular application is still on the move, and we are looking forward to positive updates from them.\u201d",
    "When asked whether new trade agreements, concessions etc. could emerge from the meetings President Anura Kumara Disanayake will be having during his Indian tour, the deputy minister replied,\u201d",
    "\u201cThe President\u2019s first official overseas visit will be to India. We believe that we also should continue that tradition as India being a very close and strong neighbour. We believe that we should start from that point. We should understand that there are many pending agreements to be signed. There are still many agreements which are being discussed. I cannot comment on everything here, but then, we are discussing with India regarding many things that were discussed in the past.",
    "So, it is a new administration. It is a new government. So, we should take decisions based on the people\u2019s and the country\u2019s benefit. So, there are many things that are being reviewed. And many things are being discussed. So, the country will have a lot of positive news after the President\u2019s visit to India. We believe that we should maintain very strong diplomatic relations with India, and they are also committed to help us. This morning also I met the Deputy High Commissioner of India who made a courtesy call at my office. We discussed many things. But we have to mention that the decisions will be purely based on the country\u2019s benefit and the people\u2019s mandate,\u201d the deputy foreign minister said.",
    "During his visit, President Dissanayake is expected to meet Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other senior officials. Discussions are expected to focus on strengthening ties and exploring cooperation across multiple sectors.",
