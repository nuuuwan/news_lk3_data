ඊයේ (29) රාත්‍රී කාලයේදී එම අනතුර සිදුව තිබුණේ හසලක පොලිස් වසමේ ඇටබගොල්ල ප්‍රදේශයේදීය.

මව හා පියා මෙම දැරියද සමඟ තම ඥාති නිවසකට ගොස් සිටියදී, නිවසෙහි තිබූ ලොරි රථයක් පණ ගන්වා ඉදිරියට ධාවනය කිරීමේදී මෙම අනතුර සිදුව ඇති බව පොලීසිය පවසයි.

අදාළ අනතුර හේතුවෙන් බරපතළ තුවාල ලැබූ කුඩා දැරිය මහියංගණය රෝහලට ඇතුලත් කර ප්‍රතිකාර ලබමින් සිටියදී මියගොස් තිබුණි.

අනතුර සිදුකළ ලොරි රථයේ රියදුරු අත්අඩංගුවට ගෙන ඇති බව පොලීසිය පවසයි.

### “Did Your Reindeer Learn to Sing” – Some ideas on Teaching vs Learning

*2024-12-29 05:37:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/did-your-reindeer-learn-to-sing-some-ideas-on-teaching-vs-learning/) · `en`

Recipient of the “Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays” from the Government of Japan

This is the season of Santa Clauses, Reindeer, Xmas cards and Gifts. This triggered my memory of a Christmas card I received long ago. I was fortunate to be selected to follow an ILO /MATCOM programme at the Vienna International Centre, Austria. The programme focused on training methodology and developing training material for managerial-level persons in Co-operative Societies through a more andragogy based methodology. It was an exhilarating experience for me, and at the end of two weeks, I had re-oriented my perceptions and attitudes on training methodology and developing training material, and acquired a vast knowledge in the area of andragogy training..

I received an interesting Xmas card from the MATCOM project at Christmas that year. It showed two Santa Clauses in conversation. The dialogue was something like this:

: “I did not say he learnt to sing; I said I taught him to sing.”

### Concluding JRJ’s Nehru letters; statement on Rajiv’s assassination

*2024-12-29 02:26:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/concluding-jrjs-nehru-letters-statement-on-rajivs-assassination/) · `en`

My father, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, has asked me to thank you for your telegram of good wishes.

I wrote to you on the 29th June 1945, soon after your release from gaol. Since I have received no reply, I presume, the Censor prevented the letter from reaching you. I am enclosing a copy of it. Instead of the Sessional Papers, mentioned in the 5th paragraph, I am sending you a copy of the Soulbury Report, which contains the relevant Sessional Papers, and a few notes of mine on it. I particularly, draw your attention to Chap. 10 & 11. I do not think, that any Indian, who seeks freedom for India, can object to the recommendations, in para 242 (i) & (ii).

### Official visits with Mrs. B to China, India and the Soviet Union

*2024-12-29 02:22:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/official-visits-with-mrs-b-to-china-india-and-the-soviet-union/) · `en`

Most important visitors to the country called over at Temple Trees to pay their respects to the prime minister. One of the most interesting of these occasions was the morning the West Indies cricket team called over on the initiative of Felix Goonewardene, then Editor of the Times of Ceylon. While world class on the field, most of them like Garfield Sobers and the legendary three W’s Walcott, Weekes and Worrell were distinctly uncomfortable in the prime minister’s presence. Exceptional among them were Conrad Hunte, who spoke eloquently of his MRA (Moral Rearmament) connections and the dashing Rohan Kanhai.

### Rajiva Wijesinha on Ranil Wickremesinghe

*2024-12-29 02:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/rajiva-wijesinha-on-ranil-wickremesinghe/) · `en`

I was perhaps a little overenthusiastic, in trying to claim objectivity for Rajiva Wijesinha’s latest book, when I said at the launch on Tuesday, December 17, at Lakmahal, that the role of the political commentator and observer is not to pass judgments, but rather to lay bare the facts for the reader to decide. During the Q and A I was bluntly – and justly – critiqued by a member of the audience: no, he said, the role is not to overwhelm the reader with facts – it is to come to conclusions, to make the reader aware.

### The Clash of the Titanic egos for American leadership: Trump v. Musk

*2024-12-29 02:19:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-clash-of-the-titanic-egos-for-american-leadership-trump-v-musk/) · `en`

The traditions of the Presidential elections in the United States are different in a few significant ways from the elections to the Heads of State in other countries, based as they are on a constitution framed and ratified in the latter part of the 18th century.

The USA elects its new president on the first Tuesday of November once every four years. But on the following Wednesday, or soon after his electoral victory is confirmed, he is just the President-elect, an ordinary citizen, with none of the powers of the Commander-in-Chief. All presidential power continues to reside with the defeated, incumbent President, until his official presidential term is over, when the transition of power takes place with the inauguration of the President-elect on January 20 of the following year, a full 11 weeks after the election.

### Russia shot the F -16 aircraft

*2024-12-29 02:17:22* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/உலக-செய்திகள்/எப்16-விமானத்தை-சுட்டுவீழ்த்தியது-ரஷ்யா/50-349419) · `ta`

Russia claims to have shot down a U.S.-supplied F-16 fighter jet over Ukraine. This alleged incident marks the second F-16 loss for Ukraine since August. The aircraft reportedly crashed while preparing to attack Russian positions. Ukraine disputes Russia's claim, suggesting the plane might have been hit by a missile rather than being shot down directly. This development highlights the escalating conflict and the advanced weaponry involved in the war.

🟩

Russia has reportedly shot the US sophisticated F -16 aircraft to use in the war in Ukraine.

Russian officials said yesterday that an F-16 aircraft flying in the Saboricia area was shot dead by Russia.. It was said that the plane was destroyed while preparing to attack the Russian status in the area.

If this information is confirmed, this is the second F-16 aircraft that has lost Ukraine.

Earlier, one of the F-16 aircraft provided by West Nations to Ukraine for the use of the war against Russia fell down during a radical missile and drone attack by Russia last August.. The pilot died.

However, Ukraine said the Russian missile was not the cause of the plane crash.

Russian authorities have reportedly shot down Ukraine's F-16 aircraft. (A)

### Libya makes waves as the Non-Aligned Conference kicks off in 1976

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

On August 6, the Prime Minister despatched me to meet President Gopallawa, and brief him on all the arrangements for the Non-Aligned Conference. The President was always dressed in spotless white cloth and a kind of formal white tunic top. He was simple in his speech, soft spoken and courteous. He also possessed a self-depreciating kind of humour. One day he told me that in 1972, when we became a Republic and the Governor General became President, he used to sometimes telephone someone and say that he was the President speaking, and invariably they asked “President of what?”

### Auld Lang Syne for the year 2024

*2024-12-29 01:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/auld-lang-syne-for-the-year-2024/) · `en`

The year just ending – 2024 – most certainly was exceptional and will make its mark in the history of Sri Lanka. The reason is political: a drastic change in systems of governance and those wielding power, and consequently ushering a change in the economic and social condition of the nation and its people. The collective psyche of most Lankans too changed from moods of hopelessness and apathy in the face of obvious corruption and rot, to optimism. And thus my chant ‘auld lang syne’ for ‘days gone by’, ‘times past’ and ‘for the sake of old times.’

This newspaper will carry many articles dissecting the past year and analyzing what could be expected from the new to be born in three day’s time. So I decided to go back to beginnings to find out the origins of a couple new year customs

Veteran journalist MR Narayan Swamy’s ‘The Rout of Prabhakaran’ is a masterly twin-book chronicle on the LTTE, which includes his earlier book, ‘Inside an Elusive Mind: Prabhakaran’ (2003). The first part of his life is narrated in ‘Elusive Mind’. It lets us in on the rise of Velupillai Prabhakaran, a village boy from Velvettithurai (VVT) who, three decades later, became the unquestioned ruler of a third of Sri Lanka’s landmass. ‘The Rout’ is a dramatic account of how he lost his fiefdom by 2009, with the ultimate humiliation of being photographed lying dead, clad only in his undervest.

Sri Lankan Ambassador for Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Bandula Wijay says that Sri Lanka must establish a medical school operating under the U.S. curriculum, open to international student enrolments, as part of an effort to brand Sri Lankan higher education.

Joining Ada Derana’s current affairs program “@Hydepark”, he emphasized that establishing such a medical school in Sri Lanka, similar to the U.S.-based Harvard and Stanford universities, will boost Sri Lanka’s foreign revenue generation while also branding Sri Lanka amongst other nations as a hub of tertiary education.

Dr. Bandula Wijay also called on the government to bring together educated experts from the United States and Sri Lanka, to form a think tank to generate comprehensive plans for navigating Sri Lanka’s way forward towards a developed nation.

Speaking further in this regard, Dr. Wijay emphasized the necessity for Sri Lanka to brand itself as a “Global Centre of Science, Technology and Innovation”.

### I will personally speak to the Government of India on the issue of Indian fishermen - Archana

Archana: "I'll speak to India about Tamil fishermen. As Jaffna MP, I'll address this livelihood issue directly with the Indian government."

🟩

Parliamentarian Ramanathan Archana said that he would personally speak to the Indian government on the issue of Indian fishermen.

Parliamentarian Ramanathan Archana met with representatives of the Jaffna District Fishermen's Federation on Saturday (28).

India has been a major factor in the politics of Tamils, not yesterday, in the 1970s and 60s. No decision seems to have been taken in negotiations.

As a Member of Parliament who represents the Jaffna District, I will speak in addition to the Minister in Parliament. The government has a majority of national people's power that can enacted laws.

The national population has the power to create laws relating to protecting our sea borders. Due to the presence of Sri Lanka in the central part of the center, it is questionable whether the issue will depend on the welfare of the people beyond politics.

The newly-appointed Chairman of Lanka Salt Company in Hambantota, T. Nandana Thilaka has urged the public to avoid panic-buying and hoarding salt amidst rumors of a shortage.

Addressing the media after assuming office today (28), Mr. Thilaka clarified that the current salt supply is sufficient to meet household needs in the country.

“Two 400-gram packets of salt powder and one kilogram of crystal salt are enough for an average household for a month,” he stated, emphasizing that unnecessary stockpiling is unwarranted.

The chairman reassured the public that the Hambantota Lanka Salt Company currently has 6,000 metric tons of salt in stock, sufficient to last until January. Additionally, he added that plans are in place to import 30,000 metric tons of salt to prevent any potential shortages.

Mr. Thilaka acknowledged that salt production has declined significantly this year, attributing the issue to long-standing neglect of the Jaffna salt pans.

### அரச நிறுவனங்களை சைபர் தாக்குதலிலிருந்து பாதுகாப்பதற்கு விசேட திட்டம் அறிமுகம்

*2024-12-28 14:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202370) · `ta`

அரச நிறுவனங்களை சைபர் தாக்குதல் அச்சுறுத்தல்களிலிருந்து பாதுகாப்பதற்காக, அரச ஊழியர்களிடையே சைபர் பாதுகாப்பு விழிப்புணர்வை மேம்படுத்துவதற்கான திட்டங்களை இலங்கை கணினி அவசரகால பதிலளிப்பு குழு வெளியிட்டுள்ளது.

அரசாங்க வலைத்தளங்கள் மற்றும் கணினி அமைப்புகளை குறிவைத்து நடத்தப்படும் சைபர் தாக்குதல்களால் ஏற்படும் தொடர்ச்சியான அபாயங்களை தவிர்க்க வேண்டியுள்ளது. அத்துடன் தாக்குதலுக்கு உள்ளான கட்டமைப்புகளை மீட்டெடுப்பது கணிசமான வருடாந்த செலவுகள் அதிகரிப்பதற்கு காரணமாகின்றது. இதனால் பொதுமக்கள் நிதி கணிசமாக வீணாகின்றது.

ஆகவே அரச நிறுவனங்கள் முழுவதும் சைபர் பாதுகாப்பை வலுப்படுத்த ஒரு விரிவான உத்தி உருவாக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. இந்தத் திட்டத்தின் முக்கிய அம்சம், அரச ஊழியர்களின் டிஜிட்டல் கல்வியறிவை மேம்படுத்துதல், சைபர் அச்சுறுத்தல்களை திறம்படக் குறைப்பதற்கான அறிவு மற்றும் திறன்களுடன் அவர்களைச் வலுவூட்டல் என்பனவாகும்.

கடந்த மூன்று மாதங்களில் 28 துப்பாக்கிச் சூட்டுச் சம்பவங்கள் நிகழ்ந்துள்ள நிலையில் அவற்றில் 16 சம்பவங்கள் ஒழுங்கமைக்கப்பட்ட குற்றக் குழுக்களால் நடத்தப்பட்டவை என்று பொலிஸ் ஊடகப் பேச்சாளர் பொலிஸ் அத்தியட்சகர் சட்டத்தரணி புத்திக மனதுங்க தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

பாதாள உலகக் குழுக்கள் ஒன்றுக்கொன்று அடிக்கடி மோதிக் கொள்கின்றன. அந்த மோதல்களின் தொடர்கின்றமை கவலைக்குரிய விடயமாகும்.

2023 மற்றும் 2024 ஆம் ஆண்டுகளில் நடந்த துப்பாக்கிச் சூட்டுச் சம்பவங்களை ஒப்பிடும் போது, 2024இல் சிறியளவில் குறைவு காணப்படுகிறது.

Combining Sri Lanka’s economic recovery with India’s “sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement” will “establish” larger markets for the island country and give it a path away from debt-fuelled growth of the last two decades, according to former president Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“The 2024 statement (India-Sri Lanka joint statement issued this month during island President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s visit) is explicit on moving Sri Lanka away from a debt-driven economic model,” Wickremesinghe said Friday at the 7th Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture organised by India Foundation at India Habitat Centre in New Delhi.

“For two decades, Sri Lanka’s economy has relied heavily on excessive debts, culminating in bankruptcy and an economic meltdown.

Therefore, the strategy in this statement is to enhance Sri Lanka’s economic development by coupling our economic recovery with India’s sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement,” he added.

He further stated that the festive season has caused a slight increase in waste generation, with the daily waste production in Colombo normally ranging between 420 and 450 tonnes.

“However, due to the large number of people arriving in Colombo by December 31, we predict that this amount could be around 500 tons,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Director of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Ajith Gunawardena stated that the large amounts of food being thrown away has led to an increase in the amount of biodegradable waste.
