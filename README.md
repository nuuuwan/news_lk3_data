ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Election Commission had received 188 complaints on Monday (11) when campaigning officially ceased ahead of the Parliamentary Election on November 14.

A majority of the complaints were on election law violations, with only one incident reported of actual violence.

Total complaints received by the commission since the election was declared on September 26 was 2,999.

The number of incidents are considerably less compared to the 8,683 reported in the previous parliamentary election in  August 2022.

Historically, Sri Lanka has seen violent incidents sometimes leading to deaths, in the run-up to general elections as not just candidates from opposing parties, but also inter-party contenders vie for preference votes (manapa pora). (Colombo/Nov13/2024)

The death of two students of an international school in Colombo's luxury series has caused great controversy and many questions.

Although many claimed suicide, the parents of one of the students who died, Joro Singh's parents, have rejected it and have reported that there have been many misunderstandings.

They have shared their memories of Givon and have reported the events that caused him to die.

The attitude of Jivon, who helped others, was the cause of his death on July 2 at luxury.

Jivon tried to help someone who was in need of his help that day. It was his natural attitude.

However, due to his dedication to help others, we have decided to respond to the false information about his death.

Givon did not commit suicide, and his immense love for life and the attitude of thinking favorably were his characteristics, and we are trying to protect his memories and ensure that his character is understood.

The Container Transport Owners’ Association says they are in dire straits due to the arbitrary actions of the Customs officials.

The Association’s chairman, Sanath Manjula, mentioned that this has caused heavy traffic congestion in roads around the Colombo Port area.

Manjula explained that due to safety concerns in areas like Orugodawatta, Thotalaga, and Grandpass, these containers were being held within the port and released to facilitate container clearances. However, after a recent inspection by the minister, authorities have decided to remove the container trucks from the port and send them out, causing traffic jams, especially in areas such as Orugodawatta and Thotalaga.

He further emphasized that this decision had put both the drivers and the containers at risk, as there have been threats to their safety.

“The Inspector General of Police and the Director General of Customs had been informed. Accordingly, they were stopped at the port premises and sent through a system,” he added.

Like everyone, the government knows that the economic crisis continues to be harshly embedded in the midst of the possibility of re -climbing. National experts and international experts have pointed out this as the International Monetary Fund has said that the country is on the knife.

The action taken by the government in transporting the country through such a situation includes the action of the International Monetary Fund's assistance program.. Although the main opposition opposed the aid plan, the previous government negotiated and obtained it. The government also considered it a great success. Today's government is not involved in self -interest that can lead to massive costs, like the previous government.

The government has expressed great admirable order and control by not abuse of state resources for election purposes. This shows that today's government leaders act as a law -abiding rule, unlike the previous leaders who considered themselves as law.

Chandrarathna Bandara’s most recent novel Piyāsara Samaya,of which the title might be loosely translated as A Time for Flying (or even a Time to Flee), is a thought-provoking novel which offers the reader a space to connect their lived experience with the narrative. It deals with the socio-political realities which were our lived experience as Sri Lankans in the recent past. The novelist’s previous work Premānishansa received the Swarnapusthaka award and the Vidyodaya award for best novel in 2022. Piyāsara Samaya which came out this September has themes which are in common with Premānishansa and the novel is set in such a way that the narrative deals with recent happenings in Sri Lanka. However, what is most noteworthy is its contribution to the literary genre of diasporic writing or novels of expatriation.

The novelist introduces two protagonists and through their characters offers many insights to certain aspects of life.

I have always been struck by two distinct moments in history. First, in June 1865, during the tenure of President Abraham Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the United States of America. And yet, there were slaves who were reluctant to embrace the associated freedoms. They appeared to be too attached to their chains.

Then, in July 1945 C.W.W. Kannangara introduced an act in parliament to ensure free education for all Sri Lankans. He was compelled to debate for hours extolling the virtues of this move. There were many who attempted to throw sand in his wheels. Among the elites there were even those who argued that if this piece of legislation was passed, they wouldn’t be able to find a boy to pluck coconuts on their extensive properties.

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMS) in a statement urged all political parties to uphold people’s expectations.

We believe that in three days, the new Parliament, made up of representatives elected by the people, will take on a greater responsibility than ever before in history.

This is especially important given the irresponsible behaviour we have seen in Parliament in recent years. Both the incoming Government and the Opposition will have a huge responsibility. Their first task should be to strengthen democracy by helping the country recover from the financial crisis we are facing. Additionally, the new Parliament must reflect the political culture that the people expect, with both the ruling party and the Opposition playing their part.
