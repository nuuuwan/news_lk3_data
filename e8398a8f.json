  "original_body_lines": [
    "Labour & Foreign Employment Minister, Manusha Nanayakkara on Tuesday (June 20) revealed that the government intends to digitize the entire foreign service sector in a bid to liberate the foreign employment sector from the clutches of human traffickers.",
    "The lawmaker also emphasized that this initiative would empower the Foreign Employment Bureau to thwart unnecessary interference and combat illegal activities effectively.",
    "He further revealed that under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Ministry of Finance has constituted a committee to oversee the implementation of this program.",
    "Minister Nanayakkara conveyed these remarks during a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre, focusing on the theme of \u2018Collective path to a stable country\u2019.",
    "Speaking further, he said similarly, the government is actively pursuing the digitization of the Labour Department. \u201cCurrently, the tender process is underway for the digitization of the Employee Trust Fund (ETF), Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF), and the e-salary service.\u201d",
    "Further, the government is taking measures to introduce a licensing system that covers all professions, from labourers to doctors, he said noting that it is crucial for anyone working in the country to be registered under this system, as it allows authorities to have comprehensive information about their employment. Additionally, a program is being implemented to extend social security benefits, including ETF and EPF, to daily wage workers.",
    "Nanayakkara also said the government is initiating a nationwide program to establish a comprehensive health and safety system in workplaces, which will be enforced through legislation. Efforts are also being made to eliminate child labour, while steps are being taken to streamline the Employee Provident Fund, collecting and digitizing relevant data to ensure efficient implementation, he added.",
    "Speaking on how the scheme to grant permits to import electric vehicles has boosted government revenue, the minister said allowing foreign workers to import electric vehicles has resulted in saving $70 million for the country. \u201cThis opportunity to import electric vehicles is available to anyone worldwide until September. We have already launched various welfare initiatives for foreign workers and are implementing national programs to provide vocational training for young people, creating job opportunities abroad. The first phase of this program will commence with the global fair in Jaffna next month.\u201d",
    "As only 40% of the workforce in Sri Lanka is engaged in direct employment, while the remaining 60% are in indirect employment, Nanayakkara said the government is committed to providing comprehensive benefits through a centralized fund. \u201cThis includes maternity benefits, compensation in case of job loss, and accident insurance. We secure these benefits through the funds acquired from ETF and contributions from employers.\u201d",
    "These measures are implemented without any bias towards political affiliations, as the government aims to safeguard the well-being of the people of the country, the minister said, assuring that \u201cregardless of party colours, we work diligently for the betterment of the nation, ensuring that political leaders make decisions based on the welfare of the people rather than their own political future.\u201d",
    "Clarifying certain \u2018misconceptions\u2019 about the much-debated Broadcasting Authority Bill, the minister said this Act does not aim to suppress the media, as the government has no intention to do so. \u201cThe Broadcasting Authority Act has several key objectives, with the primary one being the protection of freedom of speech as enshrined in the Constitution. Freedom of speech is an essential right that cannot be compromised. However, it is crucial for accurate information to be disseminated, and self-censorship and responsible reporting are vital in achieving this goal.\u201d",
    "Nanayakkara pointed out that the rules and regulations of the Broadcasting Authority Act are developed in collaboration with the Association of Broadcasters, without any government interference. \u201cJournalists and media organizations are not restricted, and licenses are issued in a fair and unbiased manner. Nevertheless, it is necessary to have an independent committee to investigate and address any misinformation or damage caused by certain media outlets in the past, ensuring that such incidents are not repeated.\u201d",
    "He said the implementation of the Broadcasting Authority Act is indeed crucial to prevent the dissemination of baseless news and unfounded rumours in the media, adding that it aims to ensure responsible journalism and protect individuals from having their honour compromised. \u201cBy enacting this legislation, we can maintain the integrity of news reporting and prevent the spread of false information.\u201d"
