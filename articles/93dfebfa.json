    "Thousands of Australians joined anti-immigration rallies across the country on Sunday that the centre-left government condemned, saying they sought to spread hate and were linked to neo-Nazis.",
    "March for Australia rallies against immigration were being held in Sydney and other state capitals and regional centres, according to the group\u2019s website.",
    "\u201cMass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together,\u201d the website says. The group posted on X on Saturday that the rallies aimed to do \u201cwhat the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration\u201d.",

    "\u201cWe absolutely condemn the March for Australia rally that\u2019s going on today. It is not about increasing social harmony,\u201d Murray Watt, a senior minister in the Labor government, told Sky News television, when asked about the rally in Sydney, the country\u2019s most-populous city.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t support rallies like this that are about spreading hate and that are about dividing our community,\u201d Watt said, asserting they were \u201corganised and promoted\u201d by neo-Nazi groups.",
    "March for Australia organisers did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the neo-Nazi claims.",
    "Some 5,000 to 8,000 people, many draped in Australian flags, had assembled for the Sydney rally, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported. It was held near the course of the Sydney Marathon, where 35,000 runners pounded the streets on Sunday, finishing at the city\u2019s Opera House.",
    "Also nearby, a counter-rally by the Refugee Action Coalition, a community activist organisation, took place.",

    "Bob Katter, the leader of a small populist party, Katter was attending a March for Australia rally in Queensland, a party spokesperson said, three days after the veteran lawmaker threatened a reporter for mentioning Katter\u2019s Lebanese heritage at a press conference when the topic of his attendance at a March for Australia was being discussed.",
    "In Sydney, March for Australia protester Glenn Allchin said he wanted a \u201cslowdown\u201d in immigration.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s about our country bursting at the seams and our government bringing more and more people in,\u201d Allchin told Reuters. \u201cOur kids struggling to get homes, our hospitals, we have to wait seven hours, our roads, the lack of roads.\u201d\u2018",
    "Laws banning the Nazi salute and the display or sale of symbols associated with terror groups came into effect in Australia this year in response to a string of antisemitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the beginning of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza in October 2023."
