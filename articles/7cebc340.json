It is a universal nature, because food is the bridge between body and soul, connecting societies and cultures. Every family boasts of its own secret recipes, and every nation and culture take pride in its own food and dishes. Just like Pol Sambol is for Sri Lankans, for Koreans, Kimchi is one of the traditional dishes that cannot do away with. There are more than 400 ways to make fermented vegetable dishes. But the spicy Kimchi we enjoy today was developed after chili pepper was first introduced in the 17th century. We make our own food by importing and adopting new ingredients and new methods from abroad.\u201d",
