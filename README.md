### ග්‍රැහැම් තෝර්ප් සිය දිවි නසාගත් බවට අනාවරණයක්

*2024-08-12 16:49:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/199859) · `si`

එංගලන්තයෙන් බිහි වූ විශිෂ්ට පිතිකරුවෙකු වූ ග්‍රැහැම් තෝර්ප් ගේ අභාවය සියදිවි නසා ගැනීමකින් සිදු වූවක් බව විදෙස් මාධ්‍ය වාර්තා කරයි.

මේ බව තෝර්ප්ගේ බිරිඳ අමන්දා විසින් හෙළිකර ඇති අතර, ඇය වැඩිදුරටත් පවසා ඇත්තේ ඔහු මානසික පීඩනයකින් පසුගිය කාලය පුරාවට දුක්විඳි බවයි.

වසර දෙකකට ආසන්න කාලයක සිට දැඩි ලෙස රෝගාතුරව සිටි තෝර්ප් ඉකුත් 05 වැනිදා අභාවප්‍රාප්ත වූ අතර, මිය යන විට 55 වැනි වියේ පසු විය.

කෙසේ නමුත් තොර්ප්ගේ බිරිඳ අනාවරණය කරන තෙක්ම ඔහුගේ මිය යෑමට හේතුව පිළිබඳ කිසිඳු සඳහනක් නොතිබුණි.

2022 මාර්තු මාසයේදී තෝර්ප් ඇෆ්ගනිස්ථාන ප්‍රධාන පුහුණුකරු ලෙස පත් කළත්, එම පත්කිරීමෙන් ටික කලකට පසු ඔහු එම වගකීමෙන් මෙන්ම සියලුම පුහුණුකිරීම් කටයුතු වලින් ඉවත් විය.

එතැන් සිට මිය යන තෙක්ම තෝර්ප්ගේ කටයුතු මෙන්ම ඔහුගේ අසනීප තත්ත්වය පිළිබඳ සියලු තොරතුරු පවුලේ අයට පමණක් සීමා විය.

වසර 12කට ආසන්න කාලයක් (1993 - 2005) එංගලන්තය නියෝජනය කළ තෝර්ප්, ටෙස්ට් තරග 100කට ක්‍රීඩාකළ කීර්තිමත් වමත් පිතිකරුවෙකි.

### Greek wildfire spreads to edge of Athens; towns, hospitals evacuated

*2024-08-12 16:29:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101181/greek-wildfire-spreads-to-edge-of-athens-towns-hospitals-evacuated) · `en`

A fast-moving wildfire fuelled by gale-force winds spread to the edge of Athens on Monday, torching trees, houses and cars and forcing evacuations of several hospitals and a dozen towns and villages, Greek authorities said.

Hundreds of wildfires have broken out across Greece since May. While summer fires are common in Greece, extraordinarily hot and dry weather linked to climate change have made blazes more frequent and intense. Wildfires fanned by extreme heat have also raged this month in parts of Spain and the Balkans.

More than 670 firefighters backed by volunteers, 183 fire engines, 32 waterbombing planes and helicopters battled the latest wildfire that broke out at 3 p.m. (midday GMT) on Sunday near Varnavas 35 km (20 miles) north of the capital.

By Monday the conflagration, the worst in Greece this year, had advanced to the village of Grammatiko, the seaside municipality of Nea Makri and the fringes of Athens’ densely populated northern suburbs at the heavily wooded Mount Penteli.

Anyone familiar with the history of Sri Lanka must recognize the fact that even after foreign domination, the leadership, whether in government, politics or professional life, has come mainly from a leisured and enlightened minority. The spread of education and changes in income levels have to some extent modified the pattern but not eradicated it.

Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe’s largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.

The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said its experts had seen strong, dark smoke coming from the northern area of the plant in southern Ukraine following multiple explosions.

“These reckless attacks endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident. They must stop now,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned in a separate statement, without attributing blame for the attack.

The fire comes less than a week after Ukraine’s forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war-start in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscow’s battlefield gains.

### Sri Lanka to pay Rs6,000 to state pensioners in October after EC opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state pensioners will be paid 6,000 rupees in October after an increase of 3,000 rupees from September was shot down by the Elections Commissions, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The cabinet decided to pay the 3,000 rupee allowance to 700,000 pensioners effective September.

But the elections commission opposed it as an election was declared, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

As a result, a 6,000 rupee payment would be made with arrears in October. From November 3,000 rupees would be added to the pension, he said.

Earlier this year a 2,500 rupee allowance was given to pensioners.

Unlike unemployed graduates who are hired without actual vacancies, many of Sri Lanka’s current pensioners were in government service working for small salaries.

In the 1980s and early 1990s when the central bank and macro-economists busted the currency incessantly without a credible anchor for money, they got very low real wages.
