  "original_body_lines": [
    "The petition filed by plantation companies against the gazette notification issued by the Minister of Labor stipulating a minimum daily wage for plantation workers has been withdrawn.",
    "Accordingly, the Court of Appeal has decided to conclude the proceedings related to the case today (06), Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "The petition had been filed by 21 plantation companies including Agarapatana Plantations Ltd. seeking a writ order invalidating the recent gazette notification issued by the Minister of Labor stipulating a minimum daily wage for plantation workers.",
    "The petitioners had claimed that the decision taken by the Minister of Labor without consulting them regarding the matter, violates the legal principle of natural justice.",
    "Accordingly, the petitioners had sought an order invalidating the decision, claiming that the decision was made arbitrarily by the government.",
    "However on July 24, the Labour Ministry had issued a new Gazette cancelling the previous Gazette notification which had been issued increasing the daily wage of plantation workers to Rs. 1,700. Meanwhile, the new Gazette had been issued directing the payments to be made through the Wages Board.",
    "The Minister of Labor had previously issued a Gazette notification setting the minimum daily wage of a plantation worker at Rs. 1,350, together with an allowance of Rs. 300 and another allowance of Rs. 80."
