    "Addressing the media personnel, Commissioner General of Excise further explained;",
    "\u201cThe three institutions under the Ministry of Finance the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department work within a legal framework to collect state revenue. Despite some groups spreading misinformation about large tax arrears, the actual total unpaid taxes for these institutions are under Rs.90 billion. Most of these arrears are from government entities, and legal actions are underway to recover the funds, meaning these amounts should be considered deferred taxes. Once the judicial process is completed, recovery is possible. Additionally, a tax deficit of 3%-5% of total tax revenue is typical for any country. Nevertheless, overall state tax revenue has seen a significant increase over the past two years.",
