“It doesn’t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice – Deng Xiaoping”

As a concerned citizen of Sri Lanka, I have closely observed the early days of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s (AKD) tenure. Elected on a platform of reform, transparency, and merit-based governance, his recent appointments to key government positions have sparked debate. Some argue that these choices contradict the very principles AKD campaigned on. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced and pragmatic approach to governance that prioritises results and effective leadership.

### Will there be an October Surprise to sway the 2024 election?

*2024-10-07 14:36:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/will-there-be-an-october-surprise-to-sway-the-2024-election/) · `en`

An October Surprise is defined as “an unexpected political event or revelation in the month before a presidential election, especially one that seems intended to influence the outcome”. Since 1980, there have been a few “October Surprises” which may have changed the history of the nation.

The phrase originated in 1980, during the presidential election season of that year. Militants in Iran had seized 66 American citizens from the US Embassy in 1979, and held 52 of them hostage for over a year. Jimmy Carter was the incumbent president at the time. His failure to have the hostages released was the main reason he was losing in the polls to Ronald Reagan. The hostage crisis occurred after the Iran’s Islamic revolution and the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty. Carter had planned to negotiate a last-minute release of the hostages which would win him the election. It never happened.

### Sir John becomes PM, the Queen’s visit and the 1956 landslide

*2024-10-07 14:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-john-becomes-pm-the-queens-visit-and-the-1956-landslide/) · `en`

The prime minister’s father too had been named John Kotelawela and there was always a whiff of mystery surrounding `John Sr’. There had then been rumours of high intrigue, of family feuds, contract killings and near unassailable alibis. The kavi kola karayas – the wandering minstrels who preceded the radio as purveyors of news in my childhood had sung the story in racy jingles, doubtless embellishing it as time went on. But what was spoken about in whispers was that John Sr had died in prison while awaiting trial after arrest in a foreign land for killing a brother-in-law.

Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country’s history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly.

The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis’ sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military.

Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on and Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8. There is also an escalating conflict with Iran which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups that threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration.

And on Monday, Hamas showed that it was still putting up a fight. It launched rockets that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, as well as closer to the Gaza border.

### AKD should not try out RW’s failed ‘Vel Palama’ to cross to the other side

AKD cannot waste his time by seeking to cross the cliff by walking through the unstable Vel Palama as suggested by Ranil

The weakness in this Vel Palama equation is that it seeks to resolve the economic issues faced by the country at that time through a conventional method. It is a ‘within-the-frame solution’. When you see a difficulty and there is a conventional way to overcome that difficulty, you follow it without considering its efficacy or timeliness or costs. Economic strategists seek to resolve the issues by looking for solutions outside the frame. This is true for military strategists as well

### Humility, empathy and authenticity key between RW defeat and AKD victory

I attribute RW’s defeat to a distinct lack of empathy which impaired his ability to understand the needs, hardships, feelings, yearnings, and thoughts of a significant component of the population, these being the low-income earners and the lower middle-income earners. Opinions may differ but facts are stubborn. The Achilles heel of RW in many past elections, both presidential and general, has been his inability to respond to the needs of the common person. AKD, on the other hand, understood them perfectly and his message was astutely crafted to tugging at the heart strings of this section of the population, a section which had been disadvantaged over many years by elitist thinking

### A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Lebanon

*2024-10-06 21:55:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102488/a-strike-on-a-mosque-kills-19-as-israel-bombards-northern-gaza-and-southern-lebanon) · `en`

An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Israel still battles Hamas a year after the group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks further drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.
