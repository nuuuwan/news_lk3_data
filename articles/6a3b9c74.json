These and other key amendments help restore the required checks and balances between the legislature and the executive to ensure effective democratic governance. http://documents.gov.lk/files/act/2022/10/00-2022_E.pdf",
    "Anti-Corruption Act \u2013 Passed in August 2023, provides a comprehensive legislative framework to investigate and address corruption related vulnerabilities. http://documents.gov.lk/files/act/2023/8/09-2023_E.pdf",

    "Proceeds of Crime Law \u2013 Cabinet approved the draft of the legislation on 12th August 2024. This law will provide the legal framework for seizure of assets obtained through corrupt practices and unlawful practices.

    "Beneficial Ownership \u2013 Amendments to the Companies Act have been drafted and gazetted such that there is increased transparency and disclosure with regard to beneficial ownership.

    "Public Financial Management Act \u2013 Passed in July 2024, this law provides for rules on enhanced fiscal transparency, creating greater accountability in the usage of public funds. http://documents.gov.lk/files/act/2024/8/44-2024_E.pdf",

    "Fiscal Governance \u2013 The government undertook proactive steps to improve fiscal governance including enhanced transparency with regard to procurement (https://promise.lk/?p=public_cont&a=view_proc_awarded_public), tax holidays and tax exemptions (https://www.treasury.gov.lk/web/tax-certificates-issued-under-boi), vehicle permits (https://www.treasury.gov.lk/web/luxury-tax-exemptions). Such disclosures had not taken place in the past. The government has also established dedicated anti-corruption units at key revenue collection agencies which have hitherto shown significant corruption vulnerabilities.",
    "Governance Diagnostic Review \u2013 To obtain an independent assessment of governance gaps and corruption vulnerabilities, the government requested the International Monetary Fund to conduct a Governance Diagnostic, which was published in September 2023 (https://www.treasury.gov.lk/api/file/d0bbb4a3-3b7f-4b2e-98ae-fdecc0181788) and the government published its implementation action plan in February 2024 (https://www.treasury.gov.lk/api/file/5e0c54aa-62cd-4ac3-846a-9073dfc653c6)."
