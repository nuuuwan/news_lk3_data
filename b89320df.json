  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has recorded external current account surpluses for three straight quarters, official data shows as the country repaid debt on a net basis and built reserves with deflationary open market operations.",
    "\u201cThe current account recorded a notable surplus of US dollars 0.6 billion in Q1-2023,\u201d the central bank said in a monetary report.",
    "The external current account of a country is broadly a mirror image of the financial account adjusted for central bank reserve changes (below the line capital movements). \u00a0In a floating exchange rate central bank asset changes are absent.",
    "Countries like Sri Lanka run current account deficits largely because the government is a net borrower abroad and free capital outflows are restricted.",
    "Currency depreciation and inflation from flawed monetary regimes may also make it difficult to generate real domestic capital, and push long term domestic nominal interest rates higher, making a country dependent on foreign borrowings.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s current account deficit generally worsens when the central bank buys Treasury bills to mis-target a call money rate and market rates under a flexible inflation targeting framework, triggers unsustainable domestic credit without deposits leading to imports higher than dollar inflows.",
    "However, in recent months the central bank has sold Treasury bills down on a net basis amid weak domestic credit and built foreign reserves.",
    "The central bank said it sold down large volumes of Treasury bills reducing the face value of its Treasury bills holdings to 2.4 trillion rupees by end June 2023 meeting an International Monetary Fund quantitative performance criteria (QPC) for net credit to government.",
    "Selling down of central bank held domestic securities involves sterilized foreign exchange purchases or deflationary open market operations.",
    "Building reserves involves reducing domestic investments and lending the money to the US and other countries through the central bank (a below the line outflow), which helps narrow the current account deficit.",
    "In May the central bank bought 662 million dollars from the market, replacing reserve money created by domestic assets. Sri Lanka\u2019s reserve money (as calculated by the central bank) has also started to go up in recent weeks.",
    "The central bank can also buy surrendered dollars from IMF or other budget support loans given to the government and sterilize the liquidity to help reduce imports and the current account deficit.",
    "Budget support loans and resumed resuming halted capital projects such as from Japan after a debt restructure and budget support loan proceeds which are not sterilized or used up in expanding reserve money, will tend to widen the current account deficit.",
    "However, in the early part of the year, foreign financing of the budget was negative.",
    "Up to April net domestic financing of the budget was 901.8 billion and net foreign repayment with a net foreign repayment of 77.5 billion rupee, which also contributed towards financial account outflows.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s banks also repaid maturing foreign credit lines in recent months or kept dollars in NOSTRO accounts to square net open positions as the government also repaid Treasury bonds rupees, which helps towards a current account surplus and a deficit financial account.",
    "A country can make almost any external payment at a given exchange rate as long as the central bank does not target a call money rate or any other interest rates by printing money through open market operations for \u2018macro-economic\u2019 policy.",
    "However, when the call money rate is targeted with inflationary open market operations, a country with a reserve collecting central bank loses the ability to make external capital or even current transactions such as oil bills which are large.",
    "Analysts had warned that if call money rates are suppressed for long periods, net foreign debt will rise and the country will eventually default.",
    "Sri Lanka debt crisis trapped in spurious Keynesian \u2018transfer problem\u2019 and MMT: Bellwether",
    "Sri Lanka economy bought to tipping point by monetary fallacies",
    "How Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF-backed \u2018Young Plan\u2019 fired a foreign debt death spiral: Bellwether",
    "J M Keynes believed the inability to make foreign payments is due to lack of exports or a trade trade surplus, and was unable to grasp the idea that financial outflows, enabled by a market interest rate to balance domestic credit, automatically generates a current account surplus, as happened in Sri Lanka in the last three quarters.",
    "The mis-understanding emerged in the 1920s is known as the \u201ctransfer problem\u201d in relation to the external defaults of the Weimar republic. Economists including Bertil Ohlin and Jacques Rueff tried to explain it but the concept is difficult to grasp.",
    "After World War II however Germany operated on the principle, while the UK went begging for loans from the US and IMF till 1979.",
    "Balance of payments deficits started to emerge in the 1920s when central banks started to operate fixed policy rates for extended periods, eventually leading to the collapse of the gold standard in 1971 and a spate of defaults from the 1980s. (Colombo/Aug01/2023)"
