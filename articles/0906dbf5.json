    "Both the IMF and the Government officials should keep in mind that maintaining broad public support is as important as implementing necessary reforms",
    "The new Government and the IMF have so far been in sync. For instance, the IMF underscored the importance of securing funding for social spending and supporting the most vulnerable. President Dissanayake has assured that his Government would prioritise effective use of social funds, focusing on combating child poverty, addressing malnutrition, and improving support for differently-abled individuals. These priorities, core to the NPP\u2019s election platform, demonstrate at least some levels of alignment between the Government\u2019s goals and IMF conditions. The mutual emphasis on social spending would also help the Government maintain its strong popularity",
    "Despite the political transformations that have reshaped Sri Lanka in recent months, the country\u2019s 17th International Monetary Fund (IMF) program remains ongoing. The new Government, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was elected on a platform that promised to renegotiate aspects of the IMF deal deemed unfavourable to the people and the nation\u2019s sovereignty. Given the Marxist label on the administration\u2014ideologically contrasting with the neoliberal recommendations of the IMF\u2014scepticism about the Government\u2019s ability to successfully implement the program has naturally emerged. However, along with the Government\u2019s explicit commitment to continue the IMF program, one crucial and often overlooked factor has the potential to shift the narrative: the strong public support behind the Government.",
    "In March 2023, the IMF approved a $ 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka, to be disbursed over 48 months, to help the country recover from its worst economic crisis in history. The first tranche of $ 333 million was released on 21 March 2023, followed by the second and the third tranches of each $ 337 million on 13 December 2023 and 13 June 2024.",
    "An IMF team led by Peter Breuer, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, visited Colombo from 17 to 23 November 2024, agreed on the third review for the EFF, and confirmed the Government\u2019s intention to stay within the broad guidelines of the program. The IMF executive board approved the review the next day, resulting in another disbursement of $ 333 million, bringing total funding provided to Sri Lanka $ 1.3 billion.",
    "However, there are further priorities to be addressed to successfully resolve the current economic crisis. For example, Peter Breuer stated that maintaining compliance with tax revenue benchmarks and advancing reforms in state-owned enterprises are essential steps toward achieving a primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP next year. How the Government fairs with these aspects will soon be reflected in the interim Budget that will be presented to Parliament in December.",
    "The 2024 General Election delivered a historic victory for the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), led by President Dissanayake. The results broke records in Sri Lanka\u2019s electoral history:",
    "The NPP won 6,863,186 votes, surpassing the 6,853,690 votes garnered by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in 2020.",
    "The party secured 61.56% of the total vote, exceeding the previous record of 60.33% by the United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in 2010.",
    "The NPP claimed a two-thirds majority in Parliament, winning 159 seats\u2014including 141 district-level seats and 18 National List seats.",
    "The election marked a significant milestone for gender representation, with a record 21 female MPs elected to Parliament.",
    "Renegotiating conditions of the IMF program was one of the main promises of the Opposition parties, including the NPP, prior to the Presidential election. \u201cWe are not opposed to economic targets\u2026 [but] we must consider the social impact of pursuing economic goals. We need to engage the IMF about social spending.\u201d Dissanayake said. He also expressed, however, of ways to utilise the IMF program to advance their own agendas, such as working together on mechanisms to combat bribery and corruption.",
    "While calls to renegotiate IMF terms may appear to be a populist move\u2014and indeed that may be part of the rationale\u2014there is also a broader argument that renegotiation aligns with the long-term interests of the Sri Lankan people. In June 2024, a group of prominent academics visiting Sri Lanka underscored the importance of revisiting the conditions of the EFF to ensure that the program better serves the nation\u2019s needs, particularly in safeguarding the most vulnerable segments of society. Experts including Professor James Vreeland had also highlighted the need to address the potential adverse effects of IMF programs on the poor even before the Sri Lankan program was initiated.",
    "Despite many challenges ahead of the new Government, one factor clearly works in its favour: strong public support for the new Government. A recent study by Dr. Sujeong Shim, Assistant Professor of Political Science at New York University Abu Dhabi, highlights the significant role public opinion plays in shaping the terms and the outcomes of IMF programs. The study provides compelling evidence that public opinion provides critical information about a Government\u2019s political capital\u2014an essential factor in assessing the likelihood of successful reforms.",
    "Strong public backing signals to the IMF and international portfolio investors that a government possesses both the willingness and capacity to carry out necessary but often difficult reforms; strong public support provides an electoral buffer for the government to absorb political costs helping them maintain willingness to reform, while clear public mandate helps drive reforms through the legislature. High popularity thus strengthens a government\u2019s credibility, shaping more positive responses from global financial actors.",
    "Professor Shim\u2019s research demonstrates that such public-driven State credibility has real consequences. Governments with stronger public support tend to secure more lenient terms in IMF programs featured with larger loans and fewer conditions. Additionally, popular governments are more successful restoring international investors\u2019 confidence over the duration of the program. In essence, public opinion, a factor frequently overlooked in global finance, plays a critical role in shaping the behaviour of international stakeholders, including the IMF and investors.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s own history with IMF programs reinforces these observations. The 2009-2012 IMF program for Sri Lanka saw remarkable achievements with restored international market confidence and successful economic recovery. This program was led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s highly popular administration whose approval ratings were at times above 90%. The Government utilised its popular support and ensuing electoral victories to push forward economic reforms. By contrast, the 2016\u20132020 program achieved limited success amid a backdrop of political instability and declining public confidence in the Government. Once the Government lost its willingness to reform following its defeats in the 2018 local elections, international investors lost confidence in the Government, refusing to purchase Sri Lankan sovereign bonds. These examples underline the pivotal role of political stability and public backing in determining the outcomes of IMF initiatives.",
    "An IMF program\u2019s success hinges on the presence of a strong government with sufficient political capital. As long as a government is committed to delivering an IMF program, broad public support for the government only adds to the government\u2019s credibility. Ultimately, it is not merely the existence of an IMF program that reassures investors, but the political leadership behind its execution that truly makes the difference.",
    "Dr. Shim\u2019s research raises hopes for Sri Lanka. The new Government and the IMF have so far been in sync. For instance, the IMF underscored the importance of securing funding for social spending and supporting the most vulnerable. President Dissanayake has assured that his Government would prioritise effective use of social funds, focusing on combating child poverty, addressing malnutrition, and improving support for differently-abled individuals. These priorities, core to the NPP\u2019s election platform, demonstrate at least some levels of alignment between the Government\u2019s goals and IMF conditions. The mutual emphasis on social spending would also help the Government maintain its strong popularity.",
    "Moreover, reforms such as enhancing transparency align with the NPP\u2019s agenda to tackle nepotism and corruption, signalling a shared vision between the Government and the IMF. The departure of several entrenched political figures from the new scene further reinforces the momentum for structural change. Finally, The Institute for Health Policy\u2019s October 2024 update showed Consumer Confidence Indices at their highest levels since 2022, reflecting rising public optimism. Coupled with the World Bank\u2019s projection of 4.4% economic growth in 2024 due to faster-than-expected stabilisation, these trends indicate a favourable environment for advancing necessary reforms.",
    "Government popularity is, of course, not the sole factor that shapes the success of IMF programs; various political factors including veto players, interest groups, government ideology, and democracy \u2013 matter for successful IMF programs. However, what is clear is that Sri Lanka\u2019s new Government is uniquely positioned to leverage its strong popularity to secure both favourable terms with the IMF and successful program implementation. Both the IMF and the Government officials should keep in mind that maintaining broad public support is as important as implementing necessary reforms. There is much to be done, and with strong public backing and a commitment to reform, the outlook for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery under the current administration appears optimistic.",
