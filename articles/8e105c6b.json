    "Tourist arrivals are on the increase, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Prestigious international travel guides are very generously promoting Sri Lanka as a must-visit tourist destination. Lonely Planet says \u2018endless beaches, timeless ruins, welcoming people, oodles of elephants, rolling surf, cheap prices, fun trains, famous tea and flavourful food make Sri Lanka irresistible\u2019. The New York Times has ranked Negombo as one of the \u201852 Places to Go in 2024\u2019. There have been numerous rave reviews, in international travel publications, about tourist attractions in Sri Lanka. But all it takes to spoil a pot of milk is said to be a smidgeon of cow dung.",
    "A couple of videos doing the rounds on the Internet have exposed some eatery owners\u2019 unspeakably exploitative practices such as overcharging foreign tourists and verbally abusing them. One of them is seen threatening a foreign tourist, who refuses to pay as much as Rs. 1,900 for a kottu roti, in Colombo. He was arrested on Tuesday and released on bail yesterday. The police deserve praise for prompt action.",
    "Eatery owners are not alone in exploiting foreign tourists and hurling abuse at them; some taxi operators also exact exorbitant amounts as fare from unsuspecting foreigners, who are without anyone to turn to. Numerically insignificant as such uncivilised, greedy elements who turn aggressive and abusive at the drop of a hat may be, their sordid operations tarnish the image of the country. This is something that the state institutions tasked with promoting tourism, and all those who are engaged in the hospitality industry ought to take cognizance of.",
    "It must be made mandatory for prices to be prominently displayed in all business places to prevent customers, including foreign tourists, from falling prey to unscrupulous businesspersons. Taxis must not be allowed to operate unless they are equipped with tamper-proof fare meters, and information about their drivers is displayed, as in countries like Singapore. The need for all taxies including trishaws to be strictly regulated to protect the rights of commuters cannot be overemphasised. Ride-hailing companies may be the best option for foreign tourists, who seek hassle-free travel.",
    "Sri Lankans themselves suffer savage exploitation at the hands of rapacious businesses. There are various organisations representing the interests of the business community. They are making multiple demands ranging from debt moratoriums to the suspension of parate executions. They, no doubt, deserve relief and a leg-up to regain stability in these hard times, but they must be mindful of their responsibilities.",
    "It is incumbent upon them to ensure that their members refrain from unethical practices that bring the entire business community into disrepute. They are responsible for the so-called \u2018greedflation\u2019, which has caused the prices of commodities and services to remain extremely high despite a significant decrease in the inflation rate.",
    "Business leaders never miss an opportunity to pontificate to politicians about the virtues of transparency, integrity, etc., but shouldn\u2019t they put their house in order before being critical of others. The rupee has been rallying against the US dollar, during the past several weeks, and the cost of production has decreased significantly, but the prices of essential commodities are increasing. Eatery owners and bakers are among those who are making a killing at the expense of the public.",
    "The Consumer Affairs Authority is in a deep slumber, as is its wont, and it must be shaken awake and made to carry out its duties and functions diligently. It needs a radical shake-up, for some of its officials are believed to be compromised. Its much-publicised raids have stopped and traders are exploiting the public with impunity. The victims of fleecing have no alternative but to suffer in silence, and foreign travellers\u2019 predicament is even worse for obvious reasons.",
    "The government spends colossal amounts of state funds on tourism promotion events overseas. While such gimmicks may be necessary to attract tourists, many issues remain unaddressed at home. There is a pressing need to take stringent action against the rapacious rogues preying on foreign tourists and Sri Lankans alike.",
