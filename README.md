ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs Hambantota International Port Group said its industrial park has got a 25 million dollar investment for a mattress producing factory that will export 7,000 containers of products a year.

Comfort Mattress Lanka will construct a 62,000-square-meter factory to make sponge mattress manufacturing on a 30-year renewable lease agreement with HIGP.

It will import raw materials through global supply chain involving South East Asia and China and make the product in Sri Lanka for export.

Firms in the industrial zone will be able to use the container terminal in the Hambantota Port, Chief Executive Wilson Qu said in a statement.

тАЬThe container yard we are developing will handle transhipment and strengthen HIPтАЩs positioning as a gateway port,тАЭ he said.

тАЬWe anticipate heightened interest in the industrial park over the coming years, and as Sri LankaтАЩs economy stabilises, we foresee industries outside the port taking advantage of HIPтАЩs strategic location.тАЭ

### Government extends rice importation period

*2024-12-20 09:17:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104365/government-extends-rice-importation-period) ┬╖ `en`

The government has announced its decision to extend the period for rice importation until January 10, 2025, with the final agreement expected to be confirmed at the Cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday (23).

Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa stated yesterday (19) that measures would be taken to extend the rice import period as necessary. Accordingly, a Gazette notification formalizing the extension will be issued on December 24, 2024.

The current authorization for rice imports is set to expire at midnight today (20). Without an extension, any rice stocks imported after this deadline will need to be re-exported, according to Additional Director General of Customs and Customs Media Spokesperson Seevali Arukgoda.

Since the government granted permission for rice importation on December 4, the private sector has imported a total of 35,600 metric tons of rice. Of this, nearly 20,000 metric tons consist of Nadu rice, while 16,000 metric tons comprise Kekulu rice.

### Sri Lanka extends exchange controls devised by central bank till June

*2024-12-20 07:12:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-extends-exchange-controls-devised-by-central-bank-till-june-195357/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs cabinet of ministers have approved and extension of exchange controls in a proposed by the central bank to extend for six months exchange controls which expired on December 19.

The cabinet has approved extending the exchange control regulation for another six months.

The exchange controls have been revised, a post-cabinet statement said without specifying the changes.

The June 2024 regulations were also less tighter than the earlier ones.

Sri Lanka and other central banks which go to the International Monetary Fund regularly impose exchange control on the people due to deep flaws in their operating framework where monetary policy is in fundamental conflict with exchange rate policy.

When the policy conflicts intensify due to open market operations to narrowly target a policy rate, exchange controls are intensified instead of correcting monetary policy.

### Waqf or Habs? Urgent need for strong and independent Waqf Board

The Waqf BoardтАЩs role is not just to preserve property but to ensure that these assets are used effectively to benefit the community

In recent times, the removal and appointment of Waqf Board members have become a subject of intense controversy, driven by political pressures that undermine the very essence of the Waqf system. This interference not only dilutes the authority of the Waqf Board but also threatens its role as a pillar of Islamic social welfare. The Waqf, as an institution founded on the principles of Sharia law, is meant to be a self-sustaining force for good, benefiting generations to come. Yet, when political motives enter the picture, the sanctity and independence of the Waqf are compromised, turning it into a mere shadow of its potential.

The time is ripe for the new Government that is committed for system change to take up the issue of implementing those MMDA reforms

тАЬSystem changeтАЭ was the magical slogan coined by the Aragalaya youth, and that slogan turned out to be the magnetic vote puller for Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and his National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) at the Presidential and General Elections respectively. Although in their public campaigns AKD and NPP identified the post-independence political culture of ethnonationalism and its corrupt system of governance as the two crucial areas to be ended or radically reformed through a social revolution there are also other elements under the old system that requires reforms. In respect of the Muslim community, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) of 1951 is one such area that requires urgent reforms.

Unable to do so, Asoka Ranwala had no choice other than to tender his resignation to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

On 17 December 2024, Idampitiyegedara Wanigasuriya Mudiyanselage Jagath Wickramaratne was elected as Speaker. The election was unanimous. Dr. Jagath Wickramarathe who was elected on the NPP ticket from Polonnaruwa district is a medical doctor.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka will review the role of 115 state entities which cost 140 billion rupees a year to maintain, Cabinet Spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.

Sri Lanka now has 86 departments, 25 district secretariats, and 339 divisional secretariats; 340 enterprises owned by the government and 115 non-commercial state statutory institutions other than police.

тАЬThere are boards, commissions, foundations, universities and statutory entities,тАЭ Jayatissa said.

тАЬIn the 2024 budget, 140 billion rupees was allocated for these entities.тАЭ

The 115 non-commercial state statutory institutions come under the supervision of the Department of National Budget and 51 institutions under the Department of Public Enterprises.

The purpose of these establishments has decreased over time, or the entities have lost its timeliness, and they lack or have very little power to initiate programs, and sometimes overlap with other establishments, Jayatissa said.

### тАЬWill ensure 2022-23 crisis never recurs in Sri LankaтАЭ: President tells Parliament

*2024-12-20 06:09:49* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Will-ensure-2022-23-crisis-never-recurs-in-Sri-Lanka-President-tells-Parliament/14-770755) ┬╖ `en`

Following is the full text of the special statement made by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament on Wednesday

Yesterday, we engaged in a robust three-hour debate on debt restructuring. That discussion provided an opportunity to outline the roadmap that has led us to the current stage and to highlight the achievements we have made thus far. I will not delve into lengthy explanations, but I must address a narrative being propagated, a narrative that seeks to instil fear by suggesting that Sri Lanka may face bankruptcy again in 2028. Let me state firmly: under our leadership, we will never allow a situation like 2022-23 to reoccur in our country. In 2028, this Government will still be in power, and we will have achieved stability and resilience.

We are confident in our goal of increasing Sri LankaтАЩs foreign exchange reserves to USD 15.1 billion by 2028. This is not just an aspiration; it is a commitment that we are diligently working to fulfil.

### Beyond qualifications: Essence of leadership

*2024-12-20 05:59:49* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Beyond-qualifications-Essence-of-leadership/4-770752) ┬╖ `en`

By balancing qualifications with real-world exposure and diverse experiences, organisations can promote a culture where innovation flourishes and resilience thrives

In a world where academic achievements often overshadow other dimensions of human potential, the belief that qualifications alone define effective leadership is a widespread misconception. While degrees and certifications can indicate intellectual capability, they fail to capture the true essence of leadership. Authentic leadership transcends formal education; it is a complex interplay of emotional intelligence, empathy, vision, and the ability to inspire action. These attributes are cultivated through experience, exposure, self-awareness, and an innate understanding of human behaviour and societal dynamics.

### Politics aside: 5 critical steps to safeguard Sri LankaтАЩs hard-won gains in 2025

*2024-12-20 05:39:39* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Politics-aside-5-critical-steps-to-safeguard-Sri-Lanka-s-hard-won-gains-in-2025/4-770751) ┬╖ `en`

This week, social media was abuzz with controversy surrounding the qualifications of certain politicians within the ruling party and Opposition. The Opposition emphasised the importance of transparency and honesty in leadership, arguing that openly sharing qualifications is essential for maintaining public trust and accountability. They assert that this underscores a core principle of democratic governance: honesty as the foundation of public trust as highlighted by the NPP.

However, less than a month after the last General Election, this very principle seems to have backfired on the NPP, following the SpeakerтАЩs debacle. It is worth noting that educational qualifications are not a requirement to serve as a Member of Parliament in Sri Lanka. The eligibility criteria are limited to citizenship and being over 18 years of age.

KPMG Sri Lanka Principal тАУ Tax and Regulatory Suresh R.I. Perera

Q: Explain the change to be introduced to the personal income tax structure and the impact.

Overall, irrespective of the quantum of the salary of the person everyone will experience a reduction in the taxes paid. Since the personal relief (tax free threshold) has increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000 per month, up to 150,000 per month salary there will not be any income tax payable. Any one receiving salary over Rs. 400,000 per month will experience a tax saving of Rs. 20,500 per month.

### Concerns over neglect of small hydropower plant owners

*2024-12-20 05:34:45* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Concerns-over-neglect-of-small-hydropower-plant-owners/14-770749) ┬╖ `en`

It appears that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has shown minimal consideration towards small hydropower plant owners. Despite paying premium rates per unit of electricity generated by other categories of private power producers, the payments made to mini-hydro power plants remain disproportionately low. This discrepancy is a cause for concern.

While an acceptable rate is paid during the first 15 years or so of operation, subsequent payments drastically reduce to negligible amounts. This is particularly troubling given that small hydropower turbines and generators are often designed for lifespans exceeding 75 years. The rationale for reducing payments after just 15 or 20 years in some instances is difficult to justify.

The disparity is glaring when compared to the payments made to diesel and wind power plants, which continue to receive substantial financial support. The failure to extend similar terms to small hydropower plants is both regrettable and inequitable.

A writ petition has been filed before the Court of Appeal seeking a declaration that the Rural Development, Social Security, and Community Empowerment Minister Prof. Upali Pannilage is disqualified from serving as a Member of Parliament and is therefore ineligible to hold office as an MP.

The petition, filed by social and political activist Oshala Herath, alleges that Prof. Pannilage was employed by the University of Ruhuna, a public corporation, at the time of his appointment as an MP and subsequently as a Cabinet Minister. The petitioner contends that this contravenes the provisions of Sri LankaтАЩs Constitution, which disqualifies individuals with interests in public contracts from being elected to Parliament.

The respondents in the petition include Minister Prof. Pannilage as the first respondent, Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Anusha Rohanadeera, Vice Chancellor of the University of Ruhuna Prof. Sujeewa Amarasena, the University of Ruhuna, and the Attorney General.
