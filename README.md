South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s former defence minister was arrested on Sunday over his alleged role in Yoon’s declaration of martial law last week, prosecutors said.

The leader of Yoon’s People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, in a joint press conference with the prime minister, said on Sunday that Yoon will not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early resignation.

Ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who stepped down on Wednesday after Yoon rescinded martial law, was seen as a central figure in the debacle. He had proposed martial law to the president, according to a senior military official and the impeachment filings.
