    "The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the import of high-quality genetic dairy cattle from Pakistan in an effort to increase local milk production.",
    "A budget of Rs. 100 million each was allocated in both 2023 and 2024 to acquire these high-quality dairy cattle with good genetics, but due to complications in the procurement process, the required cattle have not been obtained so far.",

    "Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal submitted by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to acquire five Sahiwal bulls and two Nili-Ravi buffaloes from Pakistan, as well as to purchase 20,000 doses of Sahiwal bull semen for the purpose of breeding via artificial insemination, from India through government transactions."
