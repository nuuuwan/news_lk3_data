  "original_body_lines": [
    "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said India\u2019s purchases of Russian crude were funding Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and had to stop, adding that New Delhi was \u201cnow cozying up to both Russia and China\u201d.",
    "\u201cIf India wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the US, it needs to start acting like one,\u201d Navarro wrote in an opinion piece.",
    "India\u2019s Foreign Ministry has previously said the country is being unfairly singled out for buying Russian oil while the United States and European Union continue to purchase goods from Russia.",
    "US President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods earlier this month, citing New Delhi\u2019s continued purchases of Russian oil. The move will take total tariffs on imports from India to 50 per cent.",
    "\u201cIndia acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,\u201d Navarro said.",
    "The adviser also said India\u2019s close ties with Russia and China made it risky to transfer cutting-edge US military capabilities to India.",
    "Separately, Indian Oil Corp, the country\u2019s top refiner, will continue to buy Russian oil depending on economics, the company\u2019s head of finance Anuj Jain told an analyst meeting on Monday.",
    "Jain said his company\u2019s Russian oil processing in the June quarter was about 24 per cent compared to an average 22 per cent in 2024/25.",
    "He said purchases for the September quarter were continuing and the discounts on Russian oil were in the range of US$1.50 per barrel to the Dubai benchmark.",
    "Longtime rivals China and India are quietly and cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach to both.",
    "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit India from Monday for talks on the disputed border between the two countries.",
    "A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from Aug 25-29 has been called off, a source said over the weekend, delaying talks on a proposed trade agreement and dashing hopes of relief from additional US tariffs on Indian goods from Aug 27."
