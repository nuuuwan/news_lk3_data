ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka net foreign assets moved to positive territory in October 2024, with about 63 million dollars over its reserve related liabilities, official data shows, after two years of deflationary policy with interest rates to match.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank‚Äôs reserves became negative by 4.6 billion after rate cuts were enforced by inflationary direct and open market operations.

The central bank also borrowed reserves through swaps, and also busted a special drawing rights allocation (a type ‚Äòreserve‚Äô created by the International Monetary Fund) in the course of mistargeting rates through a policy rate which ended in a sovereign default.

A ‚Äòtransmission mechanism‚Äô then spreads the mis-targeted rates along the yield curve.

When reserves were hitting negative territory during the last currency crisis, the central bank already had loans from the International Monetary Fund taken during currency crises triggered by earlier rate cuts.

VAT payments in the construction industry work in strange and sometimes unfair ways

Some Inland Revenue Department (IRD) officers have misunderstood that contractors‚Äô bills have been settled as per their satisfaction. This is a myth, because although a portion of contractors‚Äô dues have been paid by previous Governments, these bills have been stagnant for two or three years. By that time, bank interests have eaten up all of their profits and have pushed them towards great losses. Further, many bills remain uncertified and these have not been settled for contractors. In such a context, some IRD officers have quoted statements regarding the settlement of these old dues to pursue contractors for tax payments within unreasonable time periods.

Prime Minister-led committee identifies issues affecting development officers' performance. Over 150,000 development officers serve under central and provincial governments. Recruitment lacks skill assessment, leading to inadequate training. 15,800 engage in teaching roles, causing administrative challenges. Committee aims to address these problems.

üü©

Although the development officers of the public service do not consider graduation as the basic qualifications of the government service, the Cabinet has decided to provide solutions to the issues that are expected to join the current officials and the graduates who are expected to join the public service.

From 1994 to 2020, more than 150,000 people are serving under the Central Government and Provincial Councils, including the development officers who have been recruited in public service through various proposals.

Development Officers have been recruited to the public service without the proper assessment of the skills and industrial qualifications of the development officers. It is impossible for them to achieve the expected action of the officers, as they are not properly provided with initial internal exercises and the obligations and responsibilities of such positions.

### The Serial stupidity of  SJB leader Sajith Premadasa whose decision to run against Ranil Wickremesinghe in Presidential election assured the mutual destruction of both and played into the hands of the NPP and Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The political Opposition in this country has yet again reduced to insignificance. This is a precarious existence for politics and the country at large, though this has been a recurrent phenomenon throughout the 2010s. Only the travails have incrementally worsened:

In 2010, during the second term of Mahinda Rajapaksa‚Äôs presidency, the UPFA won 144 seats, a tad short of the two-thirds majority, which was compensated with the pole vaulters from the Opposition to pass the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which decimated the independent commissions and removed the term limits of the presidency.

The same misfortune was revisited in 2020 when the Sri Lanka People‚Äôs Freedom Alliance, led by Pohottuwa, won 145 seats against Samagi Jana Balawegaya‚Äôs 54 seats. Bolstered by the overwhelming parliamentary majority, Gotabaya Rajapaksa instituted some of the stupidest policy decisions, effectively bringing the economy crashing down to the ground.
