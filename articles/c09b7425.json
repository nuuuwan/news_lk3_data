    "Lawmakers in the West African nation of Gambia on Monday rejected a bill that would have overturned a ban on female genital cutting. The attempt to become the first country in the world to reverse such a ban had been closely followed by activists abroad.",
    "The vote followed months of heated debate in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people. Lawmakers effectively killed the bill by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote.",
    "The procedure, also called female genital mutilation, includes the partial or full removal of girls\u2019 external genitalia, often by traditional community practitioners with tools such as razor blades or at times by health workers. It can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications but remains a widespread practice in parts of Africa.",
    "Activists and human rights groups were worried that a reversal of the ban in Gambia would overturn years of work against the centuries-old practice that\u2019s often performed on girls younger than 5 and rooted in the concepts of sexual purity and control.",
    "Religious conservatives who led the campaign to reverse the ban argued the practice was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s such a huge sense of relief,\u201d one activist and survivor, Absa Samba, told The Associated Press after the vote. \u201cThat is a lot of excitement out here. But I believe this is just the beginning of the work.\u201d",
    "In Gambia, more than half of women and girls ages 15 to 49 have undergone the procedure, according to United Nations estimates. Former leader Yahya Jammeh unexpectedly banned the practice in 2015 without further explanation. But activists say enforcement has been weak and women have continued to be cut, with only two cases prosecuted.",
    "Even now, \u201cit was widespread and there was public promotion of it,\u201d Samba said. She called for more public education about the health consequences of the practice.",
    "UNICEF earlier this year said some 30 million women globally have undergone female genital cutting in the past eight years, most of them in Africa but others in Asia and the Middle East.",
    "More than 80 countries have laws prohibiting the procedure or allowing it to be prosecuted, according to a World Bank study cited earlier this year by the United Nations Population Fund. They include South Africa, Iran, India and Ethiopia.",
    "\u201cNo religious text promotes or condones female genital mutilation,\u201d the UNFPA report said, adding there is no benefit to it.",
    "Long term, the practice can lead to urinary tract infections, menstrual problems, pain, decreased sexual satisfaction and childbirth complications as well as depression, low self-esteem and post-traumatic stress disorder."
