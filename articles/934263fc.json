The achievement is a testament to the teamwork and dedication required to steer Sri Lanka out of bankruptcy under the leadership of former president Ranil Wickremesinghe. I am extremely proud to have led the negotiating team on behalf of Sri Lanka in my then capacity as state minister of finance.",
    "Dr Harsha de Silva: The government is not making any attempts to change the Debt Stationarity Analysis of the IMF programme as they pledged the people to do during the election campaign. They have not and will not hold a single discussion with the IMF or the international creditors to alter any of the existing parameters or debt treatment principles. They lied to the people. We told the truth as to how it could be and people didn\u2019t believe us.",
    "We have been able to finalize the agreement in principle in an accelerated manner with greater efficiency and achieve more in two weeks than the previous government did within two years.",
