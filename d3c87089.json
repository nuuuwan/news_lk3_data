    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka parliament must take a call on whether its authority on public finance ought to be devolved to another entity, ruling party MP Namal Rajapaksa said, claiming that all 225 legislators must be held responsible for the 2019 tax reduction.",
    "Addressing parliament during the ongoing 2024 budget debate, Rajapaksa said much of the debate\u2019s time has been taken up for a scandal involving Sri Lanka Cricket, the conduct of the chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and a \u201ccertain court verdict\u201d.",
    "The MP was ostensibly referring to a recent Supreme Court verdict holding his father and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, two of\u00a0 President Rajapaksa\u2019s brothers and officials affiliated with their administration responsible for Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis. Among the decisions mentioned in the verdict were an ill-advised tax cut, paying off a 500 million dollar bond, and a refusal to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "According to MP Rajapaksa, some of these decisions including the tax cut was endorsed unanimously by parliament, while others were policy decisions by the then government.",
    "\u201cWe have to question whether a government policy can be challenged in court,\u201d said the younger Rajapaksa.",
    "\u201cOn the one hand, this was a policy approved by the cabinet and presented to this house, and passed in parliament upon debate. The next day, about the VAT percentage, it was once again presented to parliament and that too was passed by vote.",
    "\u201cNone of these political parties in parliament did opposed the reduction in taxes at the time. The parties that talk about it loudly today, I have to ask you if you\u2019re opposed to reducing the tax burden on the people. You supported it the, but today what is being discussed is how that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Rajapaksa.",
    "If these decisions were to be attributed to an individual or group of people, the MP said, it must be noted that they were policy decisions by the government.",
    "\u201cAll 225 who unanimously endorsed it are responsible. This is the truth,\u201d he added.",
    "Rajapaksa said if it was wrong to pay off the 500 million dollars in debt, then it can apply to the public too.",
    "\u201cIf a person cannot pay off a bankloan without banrupting himself, does he have the right to not pay?\u201d",
    "Thirdly, on going to the IMF, Rajapaksa said it was a political matter.",
    "\u201cThe IMF may be good for some people, but for others the it may not be so. So how do we determine if at this particular time should we go to the IMF or not? That cannot be done.\u201d",
    "\u201cLastly, and mainly, the country is being pushed to a place where no government can take a decision. Those who reduce taxes can be wrong, and one day those who raised it can be wrong too.",
    "\u201cThis house must decide then do we uphold Sectoin 29 of the constitution? Or do we devolve that to another party? If so then let\u2019s pass an act in parliament about that and give that to the relevant institutions.",
    "\u201cThat responsibility lies with parliament,\u201d the MP said, insisting that his party respects court verdicts. (Colombo/Nov20/2023)"
