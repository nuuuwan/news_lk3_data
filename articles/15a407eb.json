  "original_body_lines": [
    "The grid connection becomes a significant challenge as Sri Lanka scales up solar energy, Senior Lecturer at the University of Moratuwa\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering, Professor Asanka Rodrigo stressed.",
    "He added: \u201cWe must conduct extensive studies on load flow, dynamic impacts and protection measures to ensure grid stability.\u201d",
    "Delivering the keynote address, at the partnership last Friday at the Marino Beach Colombo between E.B. Creasy, said to be one of the pioneers of solar energy in Sri Lanka, and LONGI, the world\u2019s largest solar model manufacturer, Rodrigo said that he believes that the partnership highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to renewable energy and the role both companies will play in supporting the nation\u2019s green energy goals.",
    "Discussing the integration of renewable energy into Sri Lanka\u2019s national grid, he acknowledged that while the country\u2019s small size poses challenges, it also presents opportunities for growth. \u201cAs a country close to the equator, we have excellent solar and wind resources, which make solar and wind a priority in our energy mix,\u201d he noted.",
    "Rodrigo detailed the government\u2019s ambitious renewable energy goals, aiming for 70 per cent of energy from renewable sources by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.",
    "Rodrigo added: \u201cThe challenges of integrating large-scale renewable energy projects, particularly intermittent sources like solar are considerable.",
    "\u201cThe country has made significant progress in solar power deployment, achieving milestones of 200 MW in May 2019 and 1000 MW in July 2024. With an ambitious target of 4000 MW by 2030, the focus is on diversifying solar power infrastructure, including rooftop, ground-mounted, and floating solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s energy transition plan, as detailed in the draft Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LTGEP) for 2025\u20132044, reflects a commitment to reducing dependency on fossil fuels while enhancing grid reliability and energy security.\u201d",
    "Sanjeev Rajaratnam, Managing Director of E. B. Creasy & Co. PLC stressed the company\u2019s long-standing commitment to solar energy.",
    "He added: \u201cSince the year 2000, E.B. Creasy has been promoting solar energy solutions to homes and businesses in Sri Lanka. Our business depends on our ability to provide energy solutions that reduce energy bills while lowering carbon footprints.\u201d",
    "He stressed that the company\u2019s dedication to customer service and high-quality solutions has earned it the trust of the industry.",
    "Chin Lee, Head of South Asia Peninsula Region at LONGI, followed with insights into the company\u2019s achievements and future vision.",
    "He said LONGI has set seven world records for photovoltaic (PV) cell conversion efficiency in recent years. \u201cIn 2023, we achieved 27.09% efficiency with our HVC solar cells, a world record for non-concentrated silicon cells,\u201d said Chin Lee, reflecting on the company\u2019s technological innovations.",
    "He also addressed challenges in the solar market, mentioning how the price of solar panels surged by nearly 60% over the past year, but expressed confidence in LONGI\u2019s ability to navigate these difficulties while delivering reliable, high-value products to customers.",
