    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya positioned skepticism not as resistance to progress, but as a necessary force to ensure that technology serves humanity.\u00a0A self-admitted late and cautious adopter of technology, she argued that skepticism plays a vital role in keeping innovation grounded in ethics, responsibility, and real-world impact.Sri Lanka\u2019s national vision is to be recognised globally as both a consumer of AI technologies and a producer of AI talent, research, and innovation. But the Prime Minister made it clear: the digital economy is no longer an abstract policy goal. It is a shared responsibility \u2014 one that involves government, private sector, educators, civil society, and citizens alike.She illustrated this with everyday examples: the small business owner selling products overseas via e-commerce, and the student in a rural school learning coding alongside mathematics. These are the faces of Sri Lanka\u2019s digital transformation \u2014 and they reflect the need for inclusive, ethical, and sustainable progress.Opening the doors to the National AI Expo, the Prime Minister reminded that technology is a tool. Its value lies not in its novelty, but in its ability to solve problems, create opportunities, and build a just and prosperous society.Central to this transformation is education. The Prime Minister announced that Sri Lanka\u2019s most comprehensive education reforms in recent years will be launched in 2026, with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary learning and humanistic values.Key pillars of the reform include:Digital literacy, coding, and STEAM education from early gradesAI, robotics, and climate science integrated into school curriculaA shift to competency-based educationNationwide deployment of smart classrooms, devices, and trilingual e-learning platformsDigital pedagogy training for 100,000 educatorsA new Teacher Excellence Framework to elevate teaching standardsIntroduction of a national digital ID system to manage the education sector"
