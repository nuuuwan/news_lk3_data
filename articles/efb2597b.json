  "original_title": "Why are Tamil Nationalist Political Parties Unable to Forge  Unity  or Adopt  a Unified Approach to Surmount Challenges Faced by the Tamil People in Sri Lanka?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Local Authority elections are looming large on the Sri Lankan political horizon .The anticipated  Island-wide \u201cmini-election\u201d has resulted in much  activity among Sri Lanka\u2019s political parties, groups and organizations. The Tamil dominated Northern province and Tamil majority Eastern province are also caught up in this election excitement.",
    "There have been diverse attempts by  concerned  Tamil political parties to strike up new alliances or engage in strategic re-allignment  in preparation for the polls. The primary objective of course is to perform well at the local authority polls. Furthermore the anticipated local elections have an important dimension this time as opposed to earlier times.",
    "In the past,  elections in the Tamil speaking regions was a \u201cTamilised\u201d exercise. The competition was on two levels. The Tamil nationalist parties competed against each other on one level. On another level there was a clash between Tamil parties adopting a confrontational approach towards the governments of the day and Tamil parties adopting a cooperative approach  or being aligned with the governments in power.",
    "This political environment underwent a drastic change at the 2024 Parliamentary elections. For the first time in  Sri Lanka\u2019s post-independence history, a Sinhala dominated \u201cnational\u201dparty  performed exceptionally well in the Northern and Eastern provinces.",
    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP)led National People\u2019s power(NPP) obtained five out of twelve MP seats in the Northern province. The JVP-NPP got seven out of sixteen seats in the Eastern Province. Of these  MPs,seven were Tamils and Five Sinhalese. The JVP-NPP Tamil MP breakdown was Jaffna -3, Wanni-2, Trincomalee -1 and Batticaloa-1. The Sinhala MP breakdown was four in Amparai and one in Trincomalee.",
    "The Tamil parties in contrast  fared poorly except  for the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK)known in English as the Federal Party (FP). The ITAK/FP won two seats in the North and five in the east. The JVP/NPP on the other hand got five Tamil MPs in the north and two in the east. The jewel in theJVP-NPP crown of victory was its remarkable success in Jaffna the stronghold of Tamil nationalism. The JVPNPP got three of the six seats in Jaffna.",
    "The commendable success of the JVP led NPP in the north was due its campaign being spearheaded by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake known popularly as AKD. The \u201cAnura Alai\u201d(Anura wave) engulfed Tamil areas in what was a historic achievement. It was indeed a setback for the Tamil nationalist political parties. Even the ITAK\u2019s creditable show was due  to the Eastern province where the party got five seats. In the north it got only two seats.",
    "While acknowledging the political  damage done by the Anura wave, many   Tamil nationalist commentators and analysts  attributed the Tamil political debacle to disunity in Tamil ranks. They pointed out that Tamil nationalist votes had  been fragmented among several political parties and independent groups. If these votes had been cast for one or two Tamil nationalist parties alone,The AKD led JVP?NPP  could not have obtained so many seats in the north especially Jaffna. At best the JVP-NPP could have got a single seat in Jaffna. There is some merit in this line of thought.",
    "The reasoning that the lack of unity among Tamil nationalist parties and groups  has contributed to the JVP/NPP success in the north in general and Jaffna in particular has struck a responsive chord among most Tamil people. This has not gone unnoticed in Tamil political circles. Hence there is visible effort to  forge unity or a unified approach towards the forthcoming local authority polls.  By doing so the Tamil nationalist parties hope to roll back the Anura wave and regain political prestige by doing well at local elections. Unity is the key to victory is the core belief.",
    "This drive to achieve unity or a unified approach at the local polls is fuelled by another factor also. The local authority election system based on the 60 % ward cum  40% proporional representation ratio has resulted in a situation whare very few parties  have been able to get  a clear majority in the local councils. This was the case in  most of the Tamil majority local authority councils in the north and east after the 2018 elections also. Thus there is a need to  embrace unity or adopt a unified approach  in contesting local authority polls and forming viable administrations.",
    "This has led to a situation where leaders and stalwarts of several Tamil political parties and groups are engaging in talks and discussions with the ostensible purpose of achieving Tamil political unity for the local polls. It appears  that \u201c optics\u201dis what counts in this endeavour  rather than achieving real unity. The idea seems to be that of demonstrating to the Tamil people that they tried and failed to forge unity  and blaming the \u201cother\u201dparties for disunity. But more about this later.",
    "The important question that arises at this juncture is why are  the Tamil nationalist political parties not uniting?Why are they unable to forge unity or at least adopt a unified approach? Answering this question is quite difficult at present because the unity moves have not ended yet. There seems very little chances of unity but pronouncing  a final verdict seems somewhat premature now.",
    "However an excursion into the past may provide an insight into the reasons for Tamil disunity. An important case in this regard is the formation and subsequent dissolution of the Tamil national alliance(TNA). Most of the leading Tamil nationalist political parties such as the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) Ahila Ilankai Tamil Congress (AITC), Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF), Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization(TELO), Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front(EPRLF) and Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam(PLOTE) have all been constituents at one time or the other  of the now defunct TNA.",
    "The TNA that came into existence in 2001 held sway in Tamil politics for more than two decades winning the bulk of seats in Tamil majority regions. The TNA mocked as \u201ctiger dominated agents\u201dby Douglas Devananda  played a subservient role to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE)during the war years of 2001 to 2009. The TNA became the dominant political entity in the north and to a lesser extent in the east in the post-war years of 2010 to2024.",
    "The TNA broke up  \u201cofficially\u201dat the time of the 2024 Parliamentary election. The ITAK and Tamil Congress contested separately and obtained eight and one seat each. The TELO,PLOTE and EPRLF with two other parties contested under  the democratic Tamil national alliance(DTNA)label and got one seat.  Talks are now being held and letters exchanged among leaders of these three entities  about evolving a common position on issues affecting the Tamil people and on dealing with the AKD led government.",
    "The prospects for success in these unity efforts seem rather dismal. A case in point is the recent budget. When the vote was taken , the sole Tamil Congress MP  and party leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam voted against the budget. The sole DTNA parliamentarian  cum TELO Leader Selvam Adaikkalanathan voted for the budget. The eight ITAK Parliamentarians  were not present at voting time. Thus the three main Tamil nationalist parties in parliament -all of them ex-constituents of the defunct TNA- voted for and against the budget or abstained from voting.",
    "The different positions  of these parties towards the budget in Parliament is aptly illustrative of the  lack of cohesion or inability to reach a common stance  among former constituents of the Tamil national alliance. It is also indicative of existing fault lines  among Tamil nationalist parties   causing  divisions and promoting  disunity.  A brief re-run of history with emphasis on the rise and fall of the TNA is essential to understand the reasons for Tamil nationalist party disunity. It is against this backdrop that this column focuses on the formation and dissolution of the TNA with the aid of earlier writings.",
    "The origins of the Tamil National Alliance lie in  the October 10th 2000 Parliamentary election. The results in the North-East sent shock waves to the Tamils in general and some Tamil parties in particular. The ITAK was then the premier constituent of the Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF) which  contested under the sun symbol.",
    "No Tamil was elected in the politically sensitive Trincomalee district. In Batticaloa only two Tamils from the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) were elected. Another Tamil won from the ruling People\u2019s Alliance (PA). In Amparai district a Tamil Independent backed by the EPDP was elected.",
    "The Wanni district with six seats saw Two Sinhala(from PA and UNP) and one Muslim MP being elected. Two Tamil MPs from the TELO and one from the PLOTE were  alsoelected.",
    "Jaffna then  had  nine seats.The EPDP got four including the bonus seat. The TULF got three. The Tamil Congress got one.The United National Party got one. No Tamil  nationalist party got enough votes entitling it to a national list seat.",
    "2000 saw the Tamils being under-represented in the North-East. Moreover Sinhala dominated National parties and Tamil parties like the Govt affiliated EPDP had done well. The chief reasons  for the non-governmental Tamil political party debacle was disunity, fragmentation of Tamil votes and the lack of an imaginative or inspiring political agenda.",
    "The seriousness of the situation was acutely felt in the ethnically heterogeneous East  than the near homogenous North. A seminar analysing the situation was held at the Eastern University. It was chaired by former \u201cDaily Mirror\u201d columnist Dharmalingam Sivaram alias Taraki. Several academics, journalists, teachers, professionals, social workers, undergraduates and political representatives participated.",
    "It was resolved at this conference that the different Tamil political parties in the opposition should unite under an umbrella organization to prevent fragmentation of votes. It was also felt that such an organization should be broadly supportive of the LTTE. It was also decided that the LTTE\u2019s approval for the move be obtained. A steering committee with three joint chairs was formed to coordinate the implementation of this task.",
    "This task  consisted of three aspects. Firstly the approval and implicit support of the LTTE. This required guarantees of safety and security by the LTTE that it would not assassinate Tamil politicians in the opposition. In return these Tamil parties had to acknowledge the pre-eminence of the LTTE and endorse it as the sole representative of the Tamils in any negotiations.",
    "Secondly the political parties with a militant history like the EPRLF, PLOTE and TELO had to declare that they would lay down arms and not collaborate with the state in hunting the LTTE. They also had to sever links with para-military outfits connected to them like the Razeek group (EPRLF)Mohan group (PLOTE) and Ranjan group (TELO). All were functioning  in the East.",
    "Thirdly the non-militant parties like the TULF and Tamil Congress had to agree to work together in a common front with the ex-militant groups. Both parties were reluctant as they felt the hands of the  ex-militant groups  were tainted with blood. Besides the TULF stood for an \u201cunarmed democracy\u201d. There was also the long , bitter  history of rivalry between the Tamil Congress and the ITAK-TULF.",
    "The TULF was also wary because of its 1989 experience. Pressure by New Delhi had resulted in militant organizations like the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF) TELO and EPRLF contesting under the aegis of the TULF sun symbol along with original TULF candidates then. However none of the original TULF candidates won. Only Appapillai Amirthalingam got in through the national list (he had lost in Batticaloa).",
    "The LTTE in the Wanni was not directly involved in the negotiating process. But Karikalan the former Tiger political commissar for Batticaloa-Amparai was supportive and directly involved. Even as the talks were on the LTTE assassinated \u201cRobert\u201d the TELO head of Aaraiyampathy Pradeshiya Sabha (this Robert is different to the EPRLF \u201cRobert\u201d killed by the LTTE in Jaffna in 2002). The assassination was a major setback as the TELO wanted to pull out of unity talks as a result.",
    "The committee however persisted in its efforts and appealed to the LTTE\u2019s military leadership of the East. The eastern regional military commander then was none other than Vinayagamoorthy Muraleetharan alias \u201cCol\u201d Karuna. The LTTE \u201cexplained\u201d  that the assassination was a \u201cmistake\u201d due to a communication gap between the intelligence division and political wing.",
    "Subsequently leading personalities from the TELO and EPRLF met with Karikalan in secret and discussed matters. Assurances were obtained. Likewise some TULF personalities also met with LTTE leaders and had discussions.",
    "Initially there were two problems. The PLOTE led by Dharmalingam Siddharthan was willing for unity but the PLOTE cadres in Vavuniya (PLOTE stronghold) were unwilling to align with the TELO (also strong in Vavuniya) Likewise the TELO hierarchy was also reluctant to unite with the PLOTE as it feared erosion of support in the Wanni. Finally the PLOTE or its political party the Democratic Peoples Liberation Front (DPLF) opted out.",
    "The second was the long standing antipathy of the Tamil Congress towards the Federal Party/Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi and its successor the TULF. The Tamil Congress wanted all parties to unite under the Tamil Congress symbol of cycle and contest instead of the TULF\u2019s sun.",
    "Dr. Yogalakshmi Ponnambalam was then the dominant personality in the Tamil Congress as her husband  and Tamil Congress leader Kumar Ponnambalam had been killed on 5 January 2000.After protracted discussions held at her residence she consented to unite and contest under the sun symbol.Similarly some stalwarts in the TULF were also reluctant to unite with the Congress and other ex-militant groups but gradually they were won over or reduced to silence.",
    "Even as these discussions continued two parallel courses of action were also underway. One was the sudden appearance of leaflets and statements to the press by hitherto unheard of organizations like Sankiliyan padai, Kulakkottan padai and Pandara Vanniyan padai.While \u201cpadai\u201d means force the other references were to regional rulers like King Sankili of Jaffna, Kulallottan monarch of Trincomalee and chieftain Pandaravanniyan of Adankapatru. All these leaflets and statements urged Tamil unity and threatened those not cooperating with punitive action. They were given wide publicity in Tamil newspapers.",
    "The other parallel course of action was the well-meaning efforts of some Colombo based prominent Tamils to bring about overall Tamil unity. These Tamils comprised leading businessmen, professionals and social workers. Some of them were involved in discussions with counterparts in Batticaloa striving for unity. The efforts of these \u201cColombo\u201d based Tamils also played a major role in unity talks.",
    "At the penultimate stages the LTTE in the Wanni got directly involved. Some leaders of the TULF, Tamil Congress, TELO and EPRLF were contacted by telephone and urged to unite and contest under the TULF \u201cSun\u201d symbol. The LTTE factor galvanised the negotiating parties into concluding talks successfully.",
    "A working agreement among the TULF,ACTC, EPRLF and TELO was reached to form a coalition known as the \u201cThamizh Thesieeya Kootamaippu\u201d or Tamil National Alliance . The TNA would contest under the TULF symbol of sun. A scheme apportioning candidates to each party in the different electoral districts was also agreed upon.The formation of the Tamil National Alliance was announced through a press communiqu\u00e9 dated October 22nd 2001.",
    "The press communique issued on October 22nd 2001 heralding the formation of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA)was signed by four persons representing the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF)All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and Eelam People\u2019s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF).They were R.Sampanthan (TULF), N.Kumarakuruparan (ACTC) N. Srikantha (TELO) and K.Premachandran(EPRLF).",
    "The press statement had four salient points that more or less amounted to an \u201carticles of association\u201d for the Tamil National Alliance.",
    "The first was about how places on candidate lists were to be allocated to each of the four parties in a Parliamentary General election. The arrangement was as follows:",
    "The second point was about nominations as national list MP\u2019s. The order of priority was TULF, ACTC, TELO and EPRLF. If the TNA was entitled to a national list MP in terms of votes received it would first go to the TULF nominee. If entitled to a second MP it would be for the ACTC nominee.",
    "The third point was that the constituent parties should refrain from attacking or criticising each other publicly. Special care should be taken during the election campaign about not engaging in propaganda or counter-propaganda against a fellow TNA constituent.",
    "The fourth point was about intra-TNA disputes and problems. If and when such issues occurred the TNA constituents should discuss the matter among themselves in a peaceful way and arrive at an amicable solution through a majority vote. If that was not possible the services of an outside facilitator panel should be enlisted to help resolve the issue.",
    "The facilitator panel or \u201cAnusaranaialar Kuzhu\u201d comprised the following six members:",
    "The facilitators were respected members of the Tamil community primarily based in Colombo. They were mainly professionals or successful commercial entrepreneurs. With the exception of Thiyagarajah who was then the treasurer of the TULF they did not belong to any political party.",
    "It is under such circumstances that the TNA was born as a loose formation without a party constitution or structure. The newly formed alliance had its baptism of fire when Parliamentary elections was held on December 5th 2001. The TNA in its manifesto urged a negotiated settlement of the ethnic conflict and emphasised that the LTTE  would represent the Tamil people at such talks. What happened thereafter would be related in detail in a forthcoming article",
