    "Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Republic of Poland Priyangika Dharmasena engaged in discussions with Polish Chamber of Commerce Regional Director Katarzyna Kaniewska, on further promoting trade relations between Sri Lanka and Poland on 6 October 2024.",
    "Ambassador Dharmasena pointed out Sri Lanka\u2019s potential to introduce a vast range of novel Sri Lankan products to the Polish market, in addition to tea and textiles which are the current main commodity items from Sri Lanka. She also suggested that a Polish trade delegation visit Sri Lanka to explore the trade environment in the country. An online seminar to educate the Polish businessmen and entities on Sri Lanka\u2019s trading environment and potential products would also facilitate this further, Ambassador Dharmasena noted.",
    "Director Kaniewska welcomed the proposals and conveyed the Chamber\u2019s willingness to cooperate in that regard."
