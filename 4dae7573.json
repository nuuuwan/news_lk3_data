    "Secretary of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Dr. Sarath Edirisinghe requested that people in drought-hit areas be careful when collecting water from water puddles as these waters might contain high salt concentrations and bacteria.",
    "Therefore, Dr. Edirisinghe requested the people to use the collected water after boiling and filtering.",
    "\"Use filtered water as much as possible to get rid of heavy metals and bacteria,\" he said.",
    "Dr. Edirisinghe requested that people (especially children) in drought-affected areas wear face masks as these areas are full of dust particles that may cause breathing problems.",
    "He also mentioned that clear drinking water should be provided by the government to those who are unable to get water during this dry weather situation. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrmama)"
