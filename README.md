### UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees

*2024-12-12 09:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104178/un-general-assembly-demands-ceasefire-in-gaza-and-backs-un-agency-helping-palestinian-refugees) · `en`

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban.

The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA.

The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group and demanding access throughout Gaza to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. Other opposing both resolutions included Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga.

While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly.

### A no -confidence motion against the Speaker?

*2024-12-12 08:37:01* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/சபாநாயகருக்கு-எதிராக-நம்பிக்கையில்லா-பிரேரணை/175-348603) · `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



MP Ajith P. Perera threatens no-confidence motion against Speaker over missing PhD credentials. He claims Speaker must prove academic qualifications within two weeks. Opposition may unite to challenge Speaker's legitimacy if requirements aren't met.

🟩

United People's Power MP Ajith P. Perera has said that he expects to bring a no -confidence motion against the Speaker.

The National People's Power or Speaker should explain the doctor's degree of the Speaker.

Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said that if it did not, the opposition members would meet and bring a no -confidence motion against the Speaker.

If he had a really acceptable doctor degree, this story had no meaning. But it is a major problem in the delay, the government's speechless journalist in the news, and the removal of the issue of doctorate from the parliamentary website.

His doctor's degree must submit to the country in the next two weeks. Otherwise it is expected to bring a no -confidence motion. We haven't decided yet. We are going to discuss with the Opposition MPs group. If that happens, the National People's Power MPs will vote during their conscience during the no -confidence motion. Remble
