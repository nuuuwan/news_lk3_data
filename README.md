### Why Sri Lanka needs stability, not diplomatic disruption, in London

*2024-11-04 01:04:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-Sri-Lanka-needs-stability-not-diplomatic-disruption-in-London/4-768764) · `en`

London remains a critical hub for the financial and political community, and our High Commissioner—whose qualifications and experience are well suited to such a complex diplomatic post—has already been instrumental in strengthening Sri Lanka’s connections in this influential market. Removing him now would be short-sighted, not only disrupting essential progress but signalling uncertainty and inconsistency in our diplomatic priorities

As a Sri Lankan business leader with years invested in establishing our company’s presence in the UK, I’ve witnessed firsthand the critical role a steady diplomatic presence plays in navigating Sri Lanka’s international standing—especially in a place as significant as London. Recent news of the potential removal of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the UK after only one year is deeply concerning. This move risks undermining the very stability and reputation our country has struggled to regain following years of economic and political upheaval.

Veteran banker, Manoj Akmeemana, has chosen to share his decades long experience in banking and lending with bankers, students of banking and the public in the form of a comprehensive text under the title ‘Lending: Concepts, Theory, and Practice’. The book has been produced by using modern technology of producing such texts – two colours, graphs, flowcharts, and tables to make it user friendly. Insight capsules – box articles in other cases – have been added to elaborate on specific topics.

The thread-bound book in hard cover will ensure that the readers could use it for many years without running into the problem of offensive disentangled dog-eared pages which readers encounter in paperback books. But it has come in a hefty price of Rs. 4,500 (equivalent to about $ 15) which may make it only a reference book in libraries and not by many ordinary individual users.
