    "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya engaging in a cordial conversation with the students of the University of Vavuniya following the event",
    "Opines University system has expanded over the years but quality has not kept pace",
    "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, who also serves as the Education, Higher Education, and Vocational Education Minister, said that the Government will not obstruct student protests, struggles, or political activity within universities.",
    "However, she made it clear where the line would be drawn. \u201cThere will be no tolerance for violence, ragging, or any act that harms the peaceful student community within universities. We are not prepared to offer forgiveness for such acts,\u201d she said.",
    "The Prime Minister made these remarks during a discussion with academic staff, administrative officers, and students following the ceremonial opening of the newly constructed library at the University of Vavuniya. She unveiled the commemorative plaque and toured the new premises, after which attention turned to broader issues affecting university students.",
    "\u201cThe Government\u2019s expectation is not just quantitative expansion in the field of education, but to transform universities into spaces that offer quality education, producing students who can face the world and engage with it meaningfully,\u201d she said. \u201cUniversities must go beyond simply producing first-degree graduates, and the Government\u2019s goal is to develop institutions that offer postgraduate education and conduct impactful, meaningful research that benefits both the nation and the world.\u201d",
    "The Prime Minister acknowledged that while the university system has expanded over the years, quality has not kept pace. She pointed to gaps in foundational learning at the school level that are creating pressure on the higher education sector.",
    "\u201cMany in this assembly may agree that universities often fail to produce graduates who meet the expectations of their institutions. New entrants to universities frequently lack the expected quality and essential foundational skills. As a result, universities are forced to teach what should have been taught in school. This is because the responsibilities of school education are not being properly fulfilled. This situation has placed a considerable burden on the country\u2019s higher education system. We must not forget to ensure that the children are ready for the workforce or higher education when a child completes school,\u201d she said.",
    "She noted that upcoming education reforms aim to address these systemic issues and better prepare students for university and beyond. \u201cThrough the new education reform, we are working to change this situation.\u201d",
    "Dr. Amarasuriya reiterated the Government\u2019s commitment to academic freedom while drawing a line at harmful conduct. \u201cAt the same time, we place no restrictions on university students raising their voices, protesting, or engaging in student politics to claim their rights.\u201d",
    "She concluded by reaffirming the Government\u2019s policy to ensure access to high-quality education."
