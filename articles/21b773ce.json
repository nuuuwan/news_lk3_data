    "During the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture delivered by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe in India recently, he recalled that his first visit to India was as a young boy of 18 years to Chennai to sit for the London GCE A-level Examination \u2014 as was the practice in Sri Lanka at the time.",
    "Referring to multiple interactions with Indian leaders over the decades which started in his role as an assistant to former president J.R. Jayawardene, he said,\u201d When you have been in politics as long as I have, you end up knowing everyone \u2013 at some point or the other.\u201d",
    "\u201cI have also been an eyewitness to the pivotal and sweeping economic metamorphosis of India from the late 1990s onwards.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs you may recall, Sri Lanka was a forerunner in instituting an open economy in South Asia \u2013 as far back as in 1977. By 1989, as Minister of Industries, I had brought in the 2nd Generation Economic Reforms in the country, which included Sri Lanka\u2019s Strategy for Industrialization. Not long after, in 1991, India\u2019s first Generation of Economic Reforms were introduced by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, whom I had known from the early 1980s, since he was my counterpart in India when I was the Minister of Education.\u201d",
    "\u201cDr. Manmohan Singh\u2019s first budget speech as Finance Minister in Narasimha Rao\u2019s government changed the course of Indian history.\u00a0Without him, there would not have been any economic reforms in India, and without those reforms, there would not have been a modern India.\u201d",
    "\u201cIndo-Sri Lank economic cooperation moves never kicked off as envisioned due to protests by certain political parties and trade unions in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "\u201cHowever, the calamity of Covid-19 and the consequential economic crisis in Sri Lanka showed India at its best. At the most crucial moment when Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy and had only a few hundred million dollars in reserves, India valiantly stepped up to help us.",
    "\u201cThe Sri Lankan people could not have survived without the 4 billion US dollars of financing received from India through various credit lines. It was India\u2019s Neighborhood First Policy \u2013 in practice \u2013 that benefited Sri Lanka. India was followed by Bangladesh with a loan of US$200 million.\u201d",
    "\u201cFurthermore, India, as a Co-Chair of the Official Creditors Committee, gave us valuable help. All this vindicated my stand on closer economic cooperation with India, including improving connectivity in key sectors.\u00a0\u00a0By then, it was clear to most in Sri Lanka that recovery from bankruptcy and fast growth could be achieved only through closer economic collaboration with India. In July 2023, PM Modi and I announced the \u201cPromoting connectivity, catalyzing prosperity: India-Sri Lanka Partnership Vision.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe strategy in these statements is to enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s economic development by coupling our economic recovery to India\u2019s sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement. It is expected that by 2040, India would be the third-largest economic power in the world. By then, Tamil Nadu\u2019s GDP would have reached US$1 trillion. This is the powerhouse to which Sri Lanka has to connect as a nation.\u00a0\u00a0All this will establish larger markets for Sri Lankan exports and create two new economic sectors which are expected to be fast-growing. Establishing grid interconnectivity \u2014 thereby enabling Sri Lanka\u2019s potential for surplus renewable energy to engage in trading with India and Bangladesh.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the context of maritime and air connectivity \u2013 in addition to India as a global economic power, Indonesia will also be among the top 10 in time to come with Bangladesh following closely behind if all goes well.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis will lead to an explosion of trade in the Bay of Bengal area. As noted before, if Sri Lanka positions itself as a regional logistic hub, we can become a beneficiary of these developments in the region.\u201d",
    "Thus, the two governments must finalize the outstanding issues of the strategy within a short time frame and agree on the modalities to implement these proposals.\u00a0\u00a0 Today, it is only fitting that we witnessed the conclusion of the talks on economic cooperation on Vajpayeeji\u2019s birth century.",
    "During his speech, Wickremesinghe said that Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji had an instinctive understanding of the nation-building exercise and the need to maintain the unity of India\u2019s diverse peoples.",
