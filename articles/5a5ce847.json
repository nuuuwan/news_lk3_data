  "original_body_lines": [
    "Senior Economic Adviser to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa is set to deliver the keynote address at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon (PA).",
    "To be held on Friday, 29 August, the 171st AGM will bring together the membership of regional plantation companies, industry leaders, and key stakeholders to review the past year\u2019s performance and deliberate on policies and strategies for growth.",
    "Hulangamuwa\u2019s address is expected to highlight Government priorities in policy direction and reforms while emphasising the facilities afforded to the residential population.",
    "The AGM comes at a decisive moment for the plantation industry, which remains one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest sources of foreign exchange and rural employment. While tea continues to be Sri Lanka\u2019s most prominent export crop, the RPCs are steadily diversifying into high-value categories such as coffee, avocado, berries, cinnamon, cardamom and cocoa. These efforts are intended to reduce dependency on traditional commodities and strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s position in premium international markets. Parallel investments in replanting, environmental certificaations and renewable energy projects \u2013 including solar power installations \u2013 demonstrate the sector\u2019s long-term commitment to sustainability.",
    "Established in 1854, the Planters\u2019 Association has continuously represented the collective interests of Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation industry for more than 170 years. Today, it brings together 23 Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) managing a substantial share of the nation\u2019s tea, rubber, palm oil and spice plantations, as well as over 330 processing facilities. The sector provides direct employment to approximately 125,000 individuals and health and welfare services to a residential population of over one million.",
    "Marking its 171st year, the Planters\u2019 Association reaffirms its enduring role in safeguarding the industry\u2019s global reputation, championing innovation and sustainability, and contributing to national economic growth. The AGM is expected to bring together policymakers, industry leaders and stakeholders to chart a path for the plantation sector to thrive in an evolving global marketplace."
