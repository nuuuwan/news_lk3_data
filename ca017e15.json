    "The government is planning to permit limited cultivation of Cannabis (Ganja) on state land especially for export on a \u201cget rich quickly\u201d system.",
    "I quote excerpts from National Council for Mental Health of Sri Lanka website:",
    "\u201cIn Sri Lanka, because of the large-scale production of cannabis, it is exported illegally to Australia and countries in Europe. Cannabis abuse has continued in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, the number of cannabis abusers has been estimated to be 200,000 in 1996.\u201d",
    "Many consider cannabis as a harmless Ayurvedic harmless healthy medicinal preparation. This is a total misconception. The empirical findings indicate that cannabis abuse (smoking/chewing) causes severe psychological and sociological ill effects.\u201d",
    "Do not make a repetition of unwise moves, if we want to stand up alone steadily. Do not be misled by a few unwise advisors. It is akin to legalizing brothels."
