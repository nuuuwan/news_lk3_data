    "The judges have certainly made the right decision in selecting Melloney Dassanayaka to represent Sri Lanka at the Miss Universe 2024 pageant to be held in Mexico.",
    "Melloney not only won the prestigious title of Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2024 but she also took the honours in the categories Best Catwalk and Most Elegant in Evening Dress.",
    "Melloney says she is looking forward to the international event with great expectation and is confident of doing Sri Lanka proud, in Mexico.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m also excited about checking out the scene in Mexico and, maybe, also do some sightseeing with the rest of the contestants.\u201d",
    "A banker by profession, working for Standard Chartered Bank, she also actively participates in various extracurricular activities within the bank. Melloney is a member of the bank\u2019s Diversity and Inclusive Council and have previously been a part of the Women\u2019s Association.",
    "In addition, she is the captain of the bank\u2019s basketball team, and was adjudged the most valuable player at last year\u2019s Mercantile Tournament. What\u2019s more, she works part-time as a TV host, which allows her to explore her passion for media, she says.",
    "I had a very interesting chit-chat with this extremely talented and versatile beauty queen, and this is how it all went\u2026",
    "I\u2019m a go-getter who is deeply motivated to reach my full potential. I thrive on challenges, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles. My self-motivation drives me to pursue my goals relentlessly, and I believe in perseverance \u2013 no matter how difficult the situation, I never give up.",
    "2. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?",
    "I wouldn\u2019t change anything about myself. I believe every aspect of who I am has shaped my journey and contributed to my strengths and resilience. I appreciate my experience and qualities, as they\u2019ve all played a vital role in making me who I am today.",
    "3. If you could change one thing about your family, what would it be?",
    "It would be to tone down the noise a bit. While I love their enthusiasm and energy, sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. A little more quiet time would be nice, but I wouldn\u2019t trade their vibrancy for anything.",
    "I attended St. Lawrence\u2019s Convent Wellawatte and then Holy Family Convent Bambalapitiya. During my school days, I was highly active and took part in several leadership roles, including leading the school Eastern band, captaining both the basketball and netball teams, and serving as a junior prefect. I also had the honour of vice captaining the Sri Lanka schools\u2019 basketball team.",
    "Seeing the joy in my parents\u2019 eyes when I was crowned Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2024.",
    "My idea of perfect happiness is to live fully in the moment, without worrying about how long it will last. It\u2019s about embracing and enjoying the things I truly love and creating lasting memories. I believe that true happiness comes from cherishing those experiences and the connections I make along the way. I also need to add that I have four doggies with me and they give me a lot of happiness. In fact, the fourth I adopted just recently.",
    "Yes, I am. I believe that religion plays an important role in our lives, as it teaches us valuable lessons and provides a sense of calmness in our minds and souls. It reminds us to be grateful and encourages us to uplift and be compassion to one another.",
    "My ideal guy is someone who truly understands me and shares similar values. He should make me a priority and, most importantly, respect me. I value a motivated person who strives to be the best version of themselves and complements my life. It\u2019s essential that he cherishes our love and stands by my side through thick and thin.",
    "Not one but four, I admire both my grandparents on my mother\u2019s and father\u2019s sides immensely. I feel their energy runs through me, and I deeply respect their independence; they still manage their own tasks at their age. I also appreciate how, despite our age gap, they make an effort to understand my passion and support me in every aspect of my life. Their blessings and encouragement truly keep me going.",
    "Currently, it\u2019s the Miss Universe Sri Lanka Sash which we received from Mexico.",
    "12. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?",
    "My little brother; he would blame it all on me which will eventually lead me to finding a way out to get rid of him!",
    "Oh! I have so many, but each one has overpowered the other and I don\u2019t want to reveal anything out too soon.",
    "My ideal vacation would begin within the roots of my motherland because I feel like there\u2019s so much beauty and memorization within my own country. I would start my journey from Jaffna, engaging in its culture and heritage, then Trincomalee to immerse myself in the scenic beauty of some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Next, I would like to visit the ancient city of Anuradhapura. I would like to engage in a wild life safari at Wilpattu National Park and be absolutely awestruck by the magnificent animals that call our beautiful island paradise home. Finally, I would like to explore the southern part of the country and, on the way, I would like to explore some of the lesser-known pristine areas of Sri Lanka with beautiful streams, forests and landscapes.",
    "The \u201980s music; the catchy melodies and vibrant sounds create such a nostalgic vibe. The pop and rock from that era have a unique energy that feels timeless, plus, there\u2019s something special about how those songs often tell stories or evoke strong emotions.",
    "I like Gold FM, because they play the most classical and nostalgic songs that I have heard throughout my childhood, which helps brighten up my day just a bit more, every day.",
    "National Geographic is my favourite because I truly love the outdoors and it\u2019s a channel that truly brings out the beauty of nature.",
    "I\u2019d like to be born as an eagle. I think it would be incredible to experience the world from above, freely and exploring diverse landscapes. The sense of liberation and perspective would be amazing. It\u2019s also fascinating to be able to travel without borders.",
    "As the Miss Universe Sri Lanka, my major plan is to represent my country at the 73rd Miss Universe pageant in November and bring honour to Sri Lanka. I\u2019m also passionate about promoting financial literacy among women and youth, as I believe it\u2019s crucial for empowering individuals and fostering independence. Ultimately, I aspire to be remembered as someone who is down-to-earth, humble and dedicated to making a positive impact in my community. Beyond that, I am open to where this journey takes me, embracing each opportunity as it comes.",
