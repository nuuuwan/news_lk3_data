    "On average, women are paid approximately 20% less than men in Sri Lanka.",
    "South Asia will take 149 years to achieve full gender parity, while this is 67 and 95 years for Europe and North America, respectively.",
    "Providing equal employment opportunities for men and women can enable South Asia to enhance incomes by 25%.",
    "An IPS study highlights the limited success of regional integration in stimulating growth and reducing gender inequality in South Asia and offers a set of recommendations for more gender-sensitive policy reforms across sectors.",
    "Inequality results in adverse economic, social and political consequences. Unlike the advanced economies, improvements in education, fertility and incomes have not been able to enhance women\u2019s labour force participation in Sri Lanka. Gender equality is a shared vision for social justice. Thus, addressing gender inequality is crucial to achieve stronger and more sustainable development. While regional integration is seen as a potential development strategy to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and efforts toward women\u2019s economic empowerment, gender equality tends to be sidelined in such discussions. Thus, identifying and implementing the right policy mix for meaningful regional integration is vital in creating gender inclusive sustainable growth.",
    "Greater economic opportunities for women create a domino effect. In South Asia, equal employment opportunities for men and women are estimated to enhance incomes by 25%, including increased intraregional trade of USD 44 billion. Yet, despite the improvements in education and health outcomes, low women\u2019s economic participation remains a critical development challenge for developing economies including South Asia. In 2021, female labour force participation was 22% and 32% for South Asia and Sri Lanka, respectively, while all other regions except the Middle East and North Africa (18%) recorded more than 50% participation. Also, a gender wage gap of 24% indicates that on average, women are paid approximately 20% less than men in Sri Lanka. To achieve gender parity, South Asia will take 149 years, while this is 67 and 95 years for Europe and North America, respectively.",
    "Unlike South Asia, other regions like East Asia, Europe and North America are harnessing the potential benefits of regional integration by developing strong relationships with their neighbours. Intraregional trade accounts for 50% of total trade in East Asia and 22% in Sub-Saharan Africa, but only 5% in South Asia. Intraregional trade as a share of regional gross domestic product (GDP) is only 1% in South Asia while it is 2.6% and 11% in Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia and the Pacific, respectively.",
    "South Asian regional integration has been restricted mainly by high tariff and non-tariff measures, lack of trust and political will, weak policy implementation and poor infrastructure. Although the impacts are asymmetric, deeper regional integration benefits any country. Consumers gain access to cheaper goods and services; producers and exporters gain access to inputs, investment and production networks; and firms gain market access for goods and services.",
    "Reforming Stagnating Dimensions of Regional Integration Toward Gender Inclusive Growth",
    "To promote gender-inclusive growth, a recent IPS study shows that it is essential to improve the stagnating dimensions of regional integration. This process is complex and varies by country due to its multidimensional nature. There are six key dimensions: trade and investment, movement of capital, regional value chains, infrastructure and connectivity, people\u2019s mobility and legal and institutional basis for international policy cooperation.",
    "Evenly distributed dimensions lead to better regional integration and higher women\u2019s economic participation. With the most evenly distributed dimensions, the EU is recognised as the most advanced and consistent in regional integration with more than 50% women\u2019s economic participation.",
    "In contrast, South Asia\u2019s significantly uneven dimensional distribution makes it one of the least integrated and lowest women\u2019s economic participating regions in the world. South Asia focuses more on infrastructure and connectivity and movement of people and less on money and finance. Similarly, Sri Lanka\u2019s regional integration is impacted heavily by infrastructure and connectivity and this is no surprise as nearly 60% of public investment has been allocated to infrastructure development in the last few decades.",
