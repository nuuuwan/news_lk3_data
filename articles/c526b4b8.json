    "Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has strongly denied the allegations by Member of Parliament Hesha Withanage during a media briefing today, accusing the SLC President, the Tournament Director of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) and other SLC officials of involvement in match-fixing and corrupt conduct related to the LPL.",
    "As the governing body for cricket in Sri Lanka and the organizing authority for the LPL since its inception in 2020, SLC emphasized its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the sport.",
    "To this end, SLC has enlisted the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption Unit (ICC-ACU) to oversee anti-corruption measures for the LPL tournament. ICC-ACU officials attended and monitored the recent LPL player auction as part of their ongoing support, SLC said.",
    "SLC clarified that their commitment to safeguarding cricket's integrity led to the involvement of ICC-ACU officials, who informed the Special Investigation Unit for the Prevention of Offenses Relating to Sports about suspicious activities involving one of the owners of the Dambulla team. This information resulted in the arrest of the individual by local police authorities.",
    "SLC reiterated its dedication to upholding the highest standards of integrity and transparency in cricket and pledged to continue cooperating fully with the ICC and local law enforcement authorities to ensure the sport remains free from corruption and misconduct."
