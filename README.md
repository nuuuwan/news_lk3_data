### Pragmatism and peopleism

Similarities in the successful rise of Prime Minster Narendra Modi in India and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Sri Lanka

I was dining in a Colombo restaurant when the person waiting on me asked who I thought was going to win the Sri Lankan Presidential election. I said I had no vote and so would reserve my opinion but asked him who he thought would win. He said тАЬ100% sure AKDтАЭ. I said тАЬohтАЭ. The person continued as if he felt he needed to allay fears тАУ he said this is like Narendra Modi coming to power in India. A common man taking away power from the family (entrenched political establishment).

That set me thinking if indeed there was such a common thread tying the two politicians in South Asia.

In 2014, Narendra Modi and his BJP party stormed to power in India. It seemingly marked the decimation of the traditional party тАУ the Gandhi Family run Congress Party. Till 2014 the Congress party was the pre eminent power with BJP or Janatha party (its predecessor) making slow in roads.

*2024-10-04 01:43:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/195433) ┬╖ `ta`

Sri Lanka loses to Pakistan in Women's T20 World Cup. Sri Lanka failed to defend 85 runs, losing by 31 runs. Key factors: poor batting, especially in last 5 overs; Pakistan's quick runs and good bowling. Vishmi Gunaratne top scorer for Sri Lanka with 20 runs. Pakistan wins crucial match.

ЁЯЯй

In the first match of the ICC Women's R20 World Cup, Pakistan won the most essential victory at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium between Sri Lanka and Pakistan on Thursday night.

The main reason for its defeat was that Sri Lanka gave up 32 runs in the last five overs, unable to beat Pakistan's last 2 wickets quickly. In addition, Pakistan captain Fatima Sanaa's fast -paced 30 runs and the accurate bowling of bowlers made Pakistan easier.

The Sri Lankan women's team lost by 9 wickets in 20 overs and lost 85 runs.

This defeat has fallen into a heavy blow to Sri Lanka and has to face a severe crisis in the ongoing matches.

The worst feet of the Sri Lankan players on the pitch, which favored the spin, beat the wickets at regular intervals due to reckless bats.

Vishmi Gunaratne was the only young hero in the front row and scored 20 runs.

Samari Attappattu (6), Harshita Samarawickrama (7), Hassini Perera (8) and Kavisha Dilhari (3) lost the same number.
