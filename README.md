He also pointed out that, in the near future, the SJB would find itself in a chaotic and deteriorating state.

“Because of these reasons, I am resigning from all positions in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, effective from today. I have decided to put an end to my political career from here on,” Ellawala said.

ECONOMYNEXT – African swine fever which devasted Sri Lanka’s pig farms especially in the Western province has now spread to the island’s wild boar population, with animals in forest reserves starting to die, a media report said.

Dead wild boars have been found in forested areas in Gampaha, Meerigma, Peradeniya and Moneragala as well as the Yala National Park, Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror newspaper quoted Tharaka Prasad, Director, Wildlife Health at the Department of Wildlife Conservation.

“We found both swine flu and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,” Prasad said.

“The last one is not that dangerous because its mortality rate is low. Swine fever is totally fatal for the animals of the porcine family. It is highly contagious.”

He said there was no accurate number of the dead but mortality rate was very high, posing a serious threat to the wild boar population.

The most virulent form of the disease has mortality rates as high as 100 percent.

### Sri Lanka’s ill-fated LRT – following a train of thought  from policy derailment to being back on the right track

GOSL decided to terminate the project with no alternative solution to the traffic congestion issue being proposed

On 27 December, the railway community in Sri Lanka as well as national-minded islanders commemorate the day on which the inaugural Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) train ran between Colombo Fort and Ambepussa (34 miles on the main line) in 1864.

A day before that, the same demographic remembers with grief and sorrow the cataclysmic effect of the Indian Ocean tsunami which devastated a 1,500 passenger train at Peraliya on 26 December 2004, taking a toll of over 1,000 lives in a disaster that saw an estimated 30,000 deaths.

To the credit of Sri Lanka Railways, the destroyed locomotive – a Class M2a EMD-G12 (‘Manitoba’), imported under the Colombo Plan in 1956 – was fully restored a few years later, and makes its regular run on ‘D-Day’ annually, heading Train No. 8051 (#51).

### Red baby elephants, Ranil as godfather and dangerous external liaisons

Sri Lankans have been politically scammed as never before. With AKD and the NPP, there’s been generational, gender and governance change, no structural reform (let alone ‘system-change’), and most crucially no change of economic policy paradigm and corporate/superrich bias. In an inversion of their mandate, there’s stark continuity in the economic policy framework that caused Sri Lanka’s debt crisis and perpetuates mass economic austerity.

As presidential candidate Anura emphasised improvement of human resources, upgrading of human capital, as his economic keystone, but his presidential policies have placed the keystone in the opposite direction, and his macroeconomic commitments are and cannot but be ruinous to human resources/human capital.

### Speakers of Sri Lanka: “Honourable” guardians of Parliament’s sovereignty

Season’s greetings to all readers! Let me begin the second part of this article on the speakers of Sri Lanka with a reference to former Speaker Asoka Ranwala. A source who is usually well-informed about matters concerning the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National People’s Power (NPP) got in touch with me a few days ago. He said that ex-Speaker Ranwala had indeed acquired a doctoral degree from Japan.

According to this JVP/NPP “partisan” source, Asoka Ranwala has indeed acquired a PhD from a Japanese institution of higher learning and is therefore entitled to the prefix “Dr”. Apparently Ranwala, a longstanding activist of the JVP, had “escaped” from Sri Lanka when the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime had cracked down hard on the JVP in the 1989-90 period. Ranwala had made his way to Japan and resided there for several years, stated this source.

### Is “ the Writing on the Wall” for  the Thirteenth  Constitutional Amendment?

*2024-12-27 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=85250) · `en`

“ The  Writing on the Wall’is a figurative expression derived from the story of Daniel in the old testament of the Bible. Chapter five of the book of Daniel relates how the then monarch of the Babylonian empire  Belshazzar and his cronies were feasting and drinking in the night when a hand appeared miraculously and wrote some letters on the wall.

The terrified King and his acolytes were unable to read and understand what had been written. He sent  for Daniel renowned for his knowledge and wisdom. Daniel informed   Belshazzar that God has numbered the king’s days and that his kingdom would be given away. Daniel’s interpretation of the writing on the wall comes true.  Belshazzar is killed that night and his kingdom is taken over by Darius.

He was greeted by Deputy Minister of Tourism Ruwan Ranasinghe, along with the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Buddhika Hewawasam.

Sri Lanka welcomed 2.3 million tourists in 2018, but the numbers fell from then on due to Easter Sunday bombings, the Covid pandemic and in 2022 due to a currency crisis coming from central bank rate cuts enforced with printed money.

As of December 26, 195,127 tourists have arrived in December alone.

Authorities expect 256,389 tourist to land in the country by the year end which will take the total for the year to 2.061 million.

Sri Lanka originally project arrivals of 2.3 million, but the shift to website operated by VFS Global, IVS-GBS, despite protests from the tourist industry against scrapping an easy-to-use existing system, led to a crisis in the sector.
