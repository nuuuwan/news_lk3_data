    "The Government must possess a relentless drive to understand the world around us. We must first understand what we know and what we do not know. The Government\u2019s front benches are quietly slipping into that classic mistaken notion of power that authority is wisdom",
    "Minister of Industries Sunil Handunneththi\u2019s performance at a panel discussion at the 2025 Summer Davos meet of World Economic Forum held in Nanjing unleashed a monstrously huge tide of chattering that continues unabated keeping the chattering class busy on the importance of English.",
    "A friend of my vintage sent me an edited video clip of our Minister\u2019s response to a question posed to him with the sardonic remark \u2018the tragedy of our times.\u2019 This \u2018pukka sahib\u2019 hoity toity remark failed to spur my curiosity on the alleged faux pas of the Comrade Minister. I salute him for the courage he displayed in participating in the event.",
    "Later, a well-known academic and popular YouTuber known for his dialectical devilry in challenging the orthodox, shocked me with the remark that perhaps a person such as NPP parliamentarian Lakmali Hemachandra could have been deployed to avoid this embarrassing \u2018AKARATHABBYA\u2019 \u2013 predicament.",
    "So, I decided to find out more about the World Economic Forums meet at Nanjing China. The State Council of China in its English website explains why it decided to host the 2025 Summer Davos in Nanjing.",
    "It explains that \u201cThis year\u2019s Summer Davos forum is themed \u201cEntrepreneurship in the New Era\u201d and is expected to bring together around 1,800 participants from over 90 countries and regions. It will focus on five key areas -- deciphering the world economy, outlook on China, industries disrupted, investing in people and the planet, and new energy and materials.\u201d",
    "The State Council of China proceeds to explain its long-term plans for China itself and for the rest of Asia.",
    "\u201cAs one of the most dynamic regions in the world, Asia drives 60 percent of global economic growth, with China accounting for half of that contribution. This year\u2019s Summer Davos forum will provide opportunities for participants to deepen their understanding of development trends in China and Asia.\u201d",
    "I understand the anguished howls and painful yearning of the Chattering Classes who miss Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s urbane homilies on geopolitics and his penchant for important trivialities at such events.",
    "The question we must ask is does this NPP Government possess the needed \u2018Brains Trust\u2019 with diverse expertise, endowed with the elan and the bravura for strategic thinking, to navigate our nation\u2019s progress in the 21st Century. Does the NPP process within its rank\u2019s minds exposed to the vast varied literature and entrepreneurial talent pool the world offers in the new era that the State council of China intended to tap by hosting the Summer Davos in Nanjing?",
    "Obviously, Minister Handunnethhi was briefed beforehand. He responded with a prepared text. Natural beauty and splendour of our Island home, Promise of the Port City, the damage caused by brain drain were some of his salient focus points. On the issue of Trumpian Tariffs, he had no views. He had no pronounced point of view on the US dollar\u2019s hegemonic hold in global trade. He had no opinion on the possible opportunities in deepening relations with regional players in ASEAN. He was neutral on geopolitics. He was totally adrift in Geoeconomics.",
    "\u201cLet thy speech be better than silence or be silent,\u201d said Dionysius of Halicarnassus!",
    "Participating in a Global Economic parley is not about scoring political points at home. It calls for a profoundly forthright assessment of the success and failures of the past, a pragmatic grip of contemporary compulsions and a clearsighted vision of the future.",
    "To those interested in learning what transpired at the Panel Discussion at Nanjing here is the link. https://www.weforum.org/meetings/annual-meeting-of-the-new-champions-2025/sessions/is-asias-century-at-risk/",
    "His detractors accuse him of giving a \u2018Koheda Yanne Malle Pol\u2019 answer. That is unkind. The question in effect was how Sri Lanka perceived Asia in the 21st Century considering US unilateralism in global trade.",
    "Though awkward in diction and syntax the poor man was representing a political movement that has no clearly defined vision on Sri Lanka\u2019s role in 21st Century Asia.",
    "They have promised \u2018System Change\u2019. They are committed to change the system. No one knows what system they wish to replace the old system with!",
    "I was an ardent champion of AKD for the Presidency. I endorsed the NPP reluctantly and with less conviction. It was the instinctive revulsion of Tweedledum and Tweedledee that made me endorse the NPP. I didn\u2019t bother with the local government elections.",
    "It is time we remind comrade President AKD that enough is enough. Geoeconomics tells us that in the first half of the 21st Century India will be the world\u2019s third largest economy. China\u2019s will be the world\u2019s largest economy. Trump or no Trump, the \u2018exorbitant privilege \u2018of the US Dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency will end much sooner than we are led to believe by neoliberal punditry.",
    "These days I watch our parliamentary proceedings somewhat assiduously. Vituperative rhetoric of the opposition is squarely matched by puerile moralising from some Government members. Both sides contribute to the spectacle.",
    "Archbishop Desmond Tutu summed up the lot of political trapeze artists. Their \u201cArrogance really comes from insecurity, and in the end our feeling that we are bigger than others is really the flip side of our feeling that we are smaller than others.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka needs a brain trust to advise the Government on strategic engagement with key players in emerging Asia. That brings me to the point of departure of this essay \u2013 Arrogance of Ignorance.",
    "Change means becoming different. Change is intrinsic to human progress. That said, in our globally interconnected world ~ something is changing about change. The very nature of change itself \u2013 its speed, scale and impact.",
    "We are only seven months in governmental saddle, no excuse for the slow pace of change.",
    "The Government must possess a relentless drive to understand the world around us. We must first understand what we know and what we do not know. The Government\u2019s front benches are quietly slipping into that classic mistaken notion of power that authority is wisdom.",
    "Daniel Boorstin is a great historian. He authored the classic work Discoverers \u2013 A history of man\u2019s search to know his world and himself. He summed up the predicament of today\u2019s ruling party the NPP. \u201cThe greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.",
    "Another example comes to mind. When someone you dislike says something you don\u2019t understand, the easiest thing to do is to rubbish it. The fault is that of the speaker. Meanwhile the listener is cocooned in the bliss of indifference to the truth.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a universal law \u2014 intolerance is the first sign of an inadequate education,\u201d observed the great Russian writer, Alexander Solzhenitsyn. \u201cAn ill-educated person behaves with arrogant impatience, whereas truly profound education breeds humility.\u201d",
    "The brave new world the NPP promised is fast turning into a chimera."
