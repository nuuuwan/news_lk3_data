PM says she wonтАЩt tolerate a тАШpolitical insurgencyтАЩ within the govt.

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

We next flew to Tibilisi-Georgia (in the USSR) on the same private plane, placed at our disposal. We had official appointments and discussions, but the program was kept light in order to afford some relaxation and sight-seeing, which included attending some cultural shows in the evening. They were uneven in quality, with some first rate items, and others fairly ordinary. They also tended to be too long, at least by our standards.

*2024-10-28 13:19:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-executive-presidency-as-jrj-saw-it/) ┬╖ `en`

(The elected Executive Presidency was adopted in Sri Lanka in 1978. The original idea was mine and there is controversy about it in Sri Lanka now. I explained the Constitution in this lecture delivered in July 1991.)

The first suggestion to introduce the Executive Presidency system of Government in Sri Lanka was made by me while I was a Minister in the Dudley Senanayake Government of 1965-1970, in a speech to the Science Students Association of the Colombo University in December 1966.

### Working at Rosmead Place

Although Mr Bandaranaike had a spacious office at Senate Square in the Fort he preferred to work from 65 Rosmead Place, his home. As fancy took him, we would attend to the papers either at the dining table or in the sitting room. It was all very informal with the household activity going on around us. Sometimes the children were at home and their conversations with each other or the mother would be an interesting break from our file work.

### US Election Down to the Wire, Sri Lanka has Turned the Page

*2024-10-28 13:06:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/us-election-down-to-the-wire-sri-lanka-has-turned-the-page/) ┬╖ `en`

In about ten days, on November 5, the US will have its quadrennial presidential election along with its biennial House and Senate elections. The presidential election is literally down to the wire, and the two candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are fighting it out at the margins in the so called seven swing states. At the time of writing, it is a total toss up and there is no certainty about the outcome.

In a presidential election year, the American voters mark their ballots to elect their president for four years, a third of their 100 senators for six years, and all 435 members of the House of Representatives for two years. The elections to the Senate and the House are called the тАШdown ballot racesтАЩ, below the main presidential runoff.

### A revolution without violence

*2024-10-28 12:18:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-revolution-without-violence/) ┬╖ `en`

The total absence of violence before, during, and after the Presidential election has deeply impressed all sections of the population. Such exemplary discipline and conduct of the NPP took many observers by surprise, putting to shame established parties which, when they alternated in power, invariably let loose their goons to inflict pain and misery on opposition ranks. Serving in the police from 1965 to 2000, and in retirement for two and a half decades thereafter, I was witness to violence which followed every election with monotonous regularity.

Tamil Nadu tourism industry faces challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic and Easter Sunday attacks. Hotel owners report slow recovery despite increased local tourist arrivals. Special security measures planned for Ambalangoda region.

ЁЯЯй

Residents and Area Tourism workers point out that the arrival of tourists has been diminished due to the fact that there is no unusual diminishment in the arrival of foreign tourists to the Gulf Tourism Zone.

Although some Israeli tourists have left the area following travel consultation, they said that the number of local tourists has increased even though it is not currently the season.

Recent information that a terrorist attack may be carried out in the Gulf Tourism Zone did not affect the lives of the public.

### JapanтАЩs government in flux after election gives no party majority

*2024-10-28 08:34:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102968/japans-government-in-flux-after-election-gives-no-party-majority) ┬╖ `en`

The make-up of JapanтАЩs future government was in flux on Monday after voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru IshibaтАЩs scandal-tainted ruling coalition, leaving no party with a clear mandate to lead the worldтАЩs fourth-largest economy.

The uncertainty sent the yen currency to a three-month low as analysts prepared for days, or possibly weeks, of political wrangling to form a government and potentially a change of leader.

That comes as the country faces economic headwinds, a tense security situation fuelled by an assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea, and a week before U.S. voters head to the polls in another unpredictable election.
