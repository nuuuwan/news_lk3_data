### Public property, ours or theirs?

*2025-09-12 23:23:23* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Public-property-ours-or-theirs/4-781611) · `en`

It is no secret that in nearly all contracts of the State, the unseen hand is that of the politician in power

We do not think that offences against public property, giving the concept a wider interpretation, have lessened in any measure. What has happened is that the very law makers have found ways and means of interpreting the concept to their advantage, legitimising their untrammelled abuse of public affairs and public money. Their colossal excesses in the use of public money are not considered offences against public property, but attendant to the exercise of political power, therefore legitimate

“Something is rotten in the State of Denmark” – Shakespeare (Hamlet)

As the dust settles on the hullabaloo surrounding the arrest of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we the public, are left wondering what all the fuss was about.

### Strike on Doha, strike against the order: Time for meaningful response

*2025-09-12 23:19:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Strike-on-Doha-strike-against-the-order-Time-for-meaningful-response/4-781609) · `en`

By striking in the heart of Doha, Israel has not only targeted individuals but also the concept of a safe space for mediation

The Doha strike is therefore more than a tactical raid aimed at Hamas leaders; it is a strategic test for the international system. The question is not only whether Israel will pay a price, but whether the global community is willing to defend the principles it professes to uphold. If the answer is no—if words once again substitute for deeds—then every state, large or small, should reckon with what that precedent means for its own security. Today it is Qatar that has seen its sovereignty breached. Tomorrow it could be any nation whose territory offers refuge, real or perceived, to an adversary of a more powerful neighbour

US and European corporations profiting already out of the genocide are going to be the same ones which would be making even more profit by rebuilding Gaza into another Riviera once all Palestinians are either ‘spirited away’ or killed or starved to death by Netanyahu

UN and its aid agencies are pronouncing condemnation after condemnation and reading out media statements, and while UK, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and about 20 other countries including China are once again repeating the stale two-state solution and resolving to recognise Palestine as an independent state, none of them are prepared to intervene with force and stop the carnage and starvation of Palestinians. Their complicity in this crime is premeditated

Governments must continue investing in children’s nutrition, allowing every child in the region to grow up healthy and strong

Every child has the right to eat well so that he or she can grow up healthy in body and mind. When children get the right nutrition, they are full of energy and better able to learn, play, and chase their dreams. Leadership all over South Asia must prioritise collective action to overcome the triple burden of malnutrition so that, together, we can raise a generation of productive, thriving children who can build a strong and prosperous region. No company should profit at the cost of children’s health. Governments must put stronger protections in place so that children grow up surrounded by healthy food choices, not junk food marketing – UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia Sanjay Wijesekera

Unhealthy food environments are fuelling a worsening nutrition crisis for children in the region

### When politics meets drug trade: Sri Lanka Customs under fire

The Middeniya–Thalawa chemical haul shows how deeply narcotics have penetrated our borders. Unless Sri Lanka Customs comes clean on red-flagged containers, public trust is bound to collapse.

The recent seizure of 50,000 kilograms of precursor chemicals in Middeniya–Thalawa is not simply a policing triumph—it is a stark warning. Chemicals of this scale cannot move into the country unless Sri Lanka Customs, our frontline border agency, has failed in its duty of care.

Allegations of political links make the scandal even graver. One chief suspect, a former SLPP local politician, is accused of transporting enough chemicals to produce 200 kilograms of methamphetamine (“ice”) worth over Rs. 2 billion. This raises a disturbing question: how did such consignments bypass Sri Lanka Customs’ controls in the first place?

The 2025 report also highlights how AI is having a two-pronged effect on cybersecurity with AI-powered security tools helping to alleviate some of the issues associated with fatigue, while shadow AI use by employees is complicating cybersecurity efforts.

A suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been taken into custody, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday, ending an intense manhunt that followed what Trump described as a “heinous assassination.”

Kirk’s killer had eluded police and federal agents for more than 24 hours after Wednesday’s shooting, in which a sniper fired a single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, during an appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem.

“I think we have him,” Trump told the “Fox and Friends” show in an interview, adding that a person who knows the suspect had turned him in. “I think with a high degree of certainty we have him in custody.”

Trump did not share the suspect’s identity. Investigators were due to brief journalists later on Friday.

The suspect was in the custody of Utah state law enforcement, a person familiar with the investigation said, asking for anonymity.
