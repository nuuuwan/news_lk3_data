    "Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has come to the forefront among the countries in the world suffering from asthma, Sri Lanka Respiratory Disease Specialists' Association President Dr. Neranjan Dissanayake said.",
    "He said between 10% and 15% of the country's population suffers from asthma, and it affects children, young adults and the elderly with great mental and physical discomfort.",
