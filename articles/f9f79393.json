    "It has been revealed that notorious underworld figure \u2018Kehelbaddara Padme\u2019 was tipped off by certain police officers regarding the arrival of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Rohan Olugala in Indonesia to apprehend him and other criminals including \u2018Commando Salintha\u2019.",
    "This has been revealed during the ongoing investigations, police said.",
    "Further reports indicate that the Interpol Red Notice issued for the arrest of \u2018Kehelbaddara Padme\u2019 had also been disclosed to him through local police sources.",
    "A large-scale joint operation was conducted by the police forces of Sri Lanka and Indonesia, with Sri Lankan officers engaged in surveillance operations in Indonesia for several days by contributing to the effort.",
    "However, investigations uncovered that the criminal known as \u2018Darun\u2019 had been tipped off by certain Sri Lankan police officers that ASP Olugala had been absent for several days. Using ASP Olugala\u2019s phone number, \u2018Darun\u2019 has been able to check his IP address and confirm that he was in Indonesia.",
    "Subsequently, Kehelbaddara Padme, Commando Salintha, and Kudu Nilanga, upon being informed of the operation, fled the hotel where they had been staying.",
    "Meanwhile, police confirmed that a photograph of the Red Notice issued by Interpol for Kehelbaddara Padme\u2019s arrest was later found in his mobile phone.",
    "Police sources allege that several corrupt officers within the force had been maintaining close ties with Padme\u2019s faction and had been leaking information to them."
