    "Claiming that six pilots have been killed in PT-6 aircraft crashes so far, Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned why these aircraft manufactured in 1958 are still used for training purposes.",
    "He told Parliament that the PT-6 aircraft which are used for training purposes were manufactured in 1958 and the engines were manufactured in 1961.",
    "The MP said using these old aircraft for training purposes is unreasonable and regrettable and said they should be kept in museums instead of using them for training purposes.",
    "\"The government has spent USD 55 million for repair work of the Kfir fighter jets and the PT-6 aircraft costs only USD 0.75. Who should take the responsibility for these unreasonable and regrettable incidents,\" he questioned. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
