    "The Apostolic Diocese of Ceylon (ADC), in partnership with the Indian National Apostolic Diocese (INA), has announced a significant expansion of its mission globally.",
    "With the new appointment of Bishop Kirby Sinclair de Lanerolle as the General Secretary of the International Independent Apostolic Diocesan Synod (IIADS), with a mandate beyond the 670 churches in Sri Lanka to 11,000 churches in India, the Middle East and the USA.",
    "For the past decade, the ADC has been serving, covering, and representing free and independent churches in Sri Lanka. The ADC School currently trains up to 400 pastors and Christian leaders from across the country.",
    "Bishop Kirby de Lanerolle, alongside his wife Fiona, has been a transformative force in Sri Lanka\u2019s religious community. His leadership is characterised by an unwavering commitment to reconciliation and nation-building, supported by inter-religious dialogue that fosters religious harmony and justice. He advocates against the suppression and oppression of minorities. Previously guided by the late Rev. Dr. Neil Obeyesekere, they now consider Dave Hodgson of Kingdom Initiatives Ministries as their spiritual father and mentor. Bishop Kirby de Lanerolle is under the apostolic covering of Bishop Paul T. Maran, who pioneered an episcopal governance model for non-denominational free churches, integrating local cultural practices and addressing societal issues with practical solutions. This model promotes an inclusive environment that prioritises reconciliation, justice, and a \u201cSolution-Based Gospel\u201d over a conversion-based approach.",
    "Reflecting on his expanded responsibilities, Bishop Kirby de Lanerolle stated: \u201cOne of the primary insights from Jesus\u2019 ministry was its focus not on conversion but on providing solutions. He fed the hungry and healed the sick. Christians should aim to be a solution in their area\u2014be it a village, city, or nation. As the leader of the ADC with 670 free churches, my aim is to teach our Christian pastors to thrive within the privileges of a minority, honouring all religions by serving them unconditionally and without discrimination.\u201d",
    "Bishop Kirby de Lanerolle\u2019s vision for the future is clear: he aims to guide the extensive network of IIADS-affiliated churches toward a collective goal of unity and mutual respect among all faiths. This initiative marks a new era of church culture that embraces diversity and seeks to build bridges across communities.",
    "In support of Bishop Kirby de Lanerolle\u2019s appointment, Bishop INA Diocese Head Dr. Paul T. Maran of the, praised his leadership, stating: \u201cBishop Kirby is a living legend\u2014a testament to living not merely on bread but on the very words that proceed from the mouth of the Father.\u201d",
    "Bishop de Lanerolle firmly believes in the transformative potential of the free churches under his care, adding, \u201cI truly believe our free churches can provide a solution to this country. They just need the right model.\u201d",
    "ADC said this monumental appointment marks a new chapter and the global network of non-denominational free churches, fostering a future of unity, service, and impactful ministry, in accordance with the teachings and example of Christ."
