The state of bankruptcy Sri Lanka experienced can happen again if there is no change in the way the country is governed contrary to the thinking history never repeats itself

The IMF may have their own agendas. But they are in the country because our politicians and officials failed to manage the economy leading it to bankruptcy. Some degree of economic and financial discipline is evident today, thanks to the presence of the IMF. Any proposed renegotiations should be on the basis of even greater discipline, and sustainable discipline, and not pandering to populism.

### Important message for Presidential candidates

*2024-08-09 06:19:03* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Important-message-for-Presidential-candidates/4-765313) · `en`

The Asian Development Bank’s outlook, published in April 2024, forecasts Sri Lanka’s growth rate at 1.9% for 2024 and 2.5% for 2025. Similarly, the World Bank’s report from April predicts a growth rate of 2.2% for 2024 and 2.5% for 2025, based on their specific assumptions. In contrast, the IMF’s forecast is lower than these projections, while the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) provides a higher growth estimate.

What makes this country heaven by maintaining miracle growth, will it need so-called reforms and what are they? Economic Reforms, Structural Reforms, Social Reforms, and Governance Reforms. All these could be discussed, but without a proper foundation, they may not withstand. The following discussion is for making a sound foundation.

### Adapting concepts of Islamic Finance to an effective debt restructuring mechanism

Islamic Finance (IF) is based on the Shariah principles which are interpreted via Quran and Sunnah. It is operated currently globally not only in Muslim countries, in other Western and Eastern countries which are based on conventional banking principles. Hence, it is imperative to analyse how the IF can be adopted as a global financial system in order to address most of the current economic hazards in the world.

In Islam, it highly considers that the resources are needed to fulfil the material requirements of both individual and society. The high concern and knowledge on these ethical principles are directed to the personal and societal justice and tranquillity which is the way to the fair financial system. Especially, in the event of handling the distressed customers in the financial institutions, the principles of IF can be successfully adapted.

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Ratnapura district stalwart Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi will back President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming Presidential election.

In a statement, Wanniarachchi who is also the Irrigation, Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation Minister said she had arrived at the decision to support Wickremesinghe after lengthy discussions with party members, social activists, and other parties.

Over 92 Government MPs have already declared their support for Ranil Wickremesinghe, openly defying the SLPP’s decision to nominate Namal Rajapaksa as its Presidential candidate. This growing faction of MPs, including Pavithra Wanniarachchi, signals a significant split within the party, as many choose to back Wickremesinghe’s independent candidacy over the SLPP’s official nominee.

*2024-08-09 01:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190617) · `ta`

It seems like you've shared a comprehensive overview of the evolution of warfare, focusing on armored vehicles, drones, and the strategic shifts that have occurred over time. This narrative spans several decades, highlighting key moments such as the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, the US military's concept of "air war," the role of drones in modern conflicts, and the recent developments in Ukraine.



Your account underscores the significant technological advancements and strategic adaptations that have shaped contemporary warfare. It also touches upon the geopolitical implications of these changes, such as the reliance on industrial strength and the role of alliances like NATO in supporting military efforts.



Given the complexity and breadth of the topics covered, do you have any specific questions or aspects you'd like to delve deeper into? Whether it's the impact of drone technology, the evolution of armored vehicle tactics, or the influence of industrial capacity on military strategy, I'm here to assist further.

On February 24, 2022, Russia aims Russia's "Special Military Action" (Spetsialnaya Voennaya Operatsiya - SVO) aimed at the removal of Ukraine's "militarization". Russian forces launched their campaign as in 2014 in Crimea. Ukrainian forces do not oppose. There is evidence that the Russians did not expect the extent of the opposition they faced.

In the north, the Russians made good progress until they reached the Ukrainian capital, Kiiv, where the air force tried to capture the Antonov Airport. Here, the strong Ukrainian resistance stopped them in their ways and eventually pushed them backwards.

In the south, the Russian forces attacked the port of Mary, as the Russians were deeply infiltrated and crossed the Dinipper River, crossing the Dinipper River before they were stopped by high forces outside Mikola.
