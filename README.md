These were roles customised for Sajith and the SJB to play: SWRD 1956, Ranasinghe Premadasa 1988 or both.

The objective of lowering generation costs and, consequently, consumer tariffs will certainly not be achieved by the recent cabinet decision to reduce the Feed-In Tariff for Solar Rooftop PV, which, fortunately, has not been approved by the PUCSL

It is everyone’s hope that we may at last be moving towards a new dawn of prosperity and a future of sustainable growth in all aspects of economy and social well-being, with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake leading the way.

This hope is most prevalent in the Energy Sector, which has remained in the clutches of the fossil fuel lobby. While the transport fuels still remain nearly 100% dependent on imported fossil fuels, energy sources used for generation electricity generation have shown some progress in reducing dependence on such imports through the use of indigenous renewable energy sources.

When women are empowered, they become active contributors to the economy, driving growth and creating opportunities for all

Women empowerment is defined as “raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, equal status in society, better livelihood, and also accepting women’s viewpoints as well”, and it has become a significant aspect of the socio-economic development of a country. Women empowerment is categorised into 5 main pillars, namely, social, educational, economic, political, and psychological pillars.

The rural female labour force is 32.6% while the female urban labour force is 29.3%. Of the labour force, 6.5% of females are categorised as unemployed in the same year. Out of the total number of persons who migrated for foreign employment, 40% are females of whom 23.8% have migrated as housemaids.

Meddegoda had said, “If war crimes aren’t investigated (here), even political leaders might face travel restrictions.” In my view, not only political leaders but also investigators, prosecutors and even judges and their families, who fail to uphold human right laws may get exposed not only for international travel restrictions but also for other forms of legal harassments.

Economic and social policies based on Buddhist principles were the foundation of peace and prosperity in ancient Sri Lanka. A close examination of this Buddhist foundation would be of assistance to attain, once again, the cherished goal of peace and economic prosperity.

Economic and political theories before Western influence were based on two famous ancient treatises, namely, Kautilya’s Arthaśāstra and Brihaspati’s Arthaśāstra. They had one common feature, in that, under the title of Arthaśātra both writers had written on politics and economics, leaving out the most important ingredient for any development process, i.e. the mental and spiritual development of man.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka began crediting retired government servants’ bank accounts with an allowance of 3,000 rupees on Wednesday ahead of the general elections.

“Starting today, a monthly interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 will be credited to all pensioners’ accounts. Pensioners with bank accounts will get it today, while those using post offices can access it from the 18th,” President Anura Dissanayake said on X.

The Treasury has allocated the required amount to the Department of Pensions, the president’s media division said.

“The Treasury Operations Department has provided an allocation of Rs. 2,021 million for 679,960 pensioners this month.”

Sri Lanka’s general election to select 225 representatives is scheduled for November 14, with postal voting beginning on October 30.

A cabinet decision in August by the previous government to provide the allowance to pensioners was halted by the Election Commission. (Colombo/Oct16/2024)
