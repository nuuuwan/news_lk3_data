    "A blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures stirred up dangerous travel conditions in parts of the central U.S. on Sunday, as a disruptive winter storm brought the possibility of the heaviest snowfall in a decade to some areas.",
    "Snow and ice blanketed major roadways in nearly all of Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the state\u2019s National Guard was activated to help any motorists who were stuck. At least 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow were expected, particularly north of Interstate 70, as the National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 45 mph (72 kph). The warning extended to New Jersey for Monday and into early Tuesday.",
    "\u201cFor locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,\u201d the weather service said.",
    "Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at a thick coating of ice on his SUV Sunday in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri. Wright said he will work remotely for the University of Missouri-Columbia on Monday, but wanted to scrape off his vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. He\u2019s also in the market for boots for their two older dogs, who \u201cwon\u2019t budge at all\u201d when their paws hit the cold ground.",
    "The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole. People in the U.S., Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and stretches south.",
    "Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip.",
    "In Indiana, snow fully covered portions of Interstate 64, Interstate 69 and U.S. Route 41, prompting Indiana State Police to plead with motorists to stay off the roads as plows worked to keep up with the pace of the precipitation.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a half hour the roadways are completely covered again,\u201d Sgt. Todd Ringle said.",
    "Roughly 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow had fallen in parts of Kansas, with snow and sleet totals predicted to top 14 inches (36 centimeters) for parts of that state and northern Missouri.",
    "In Kentucky, Louisville recorded 7.7 inches (19.5 centimeters) of snow on Sunday, a new record for the date that shattered the previous mark of 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) set in 1910. Lexington, Kentucky, also set a snowfall record, with 5 inches (12.7 centimeters).",
    "Parts of upstate New York saw 3 feet (0.9 meters) or more of snow from a lake effect event expected to last until late Sunday afternoon.",
    "The storm was forecast to move into the Ohio Valley and reach the Mid-Atlantic states later Sunday and Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida.",
    "Damaging winds brought down trees across the Deep South. The weather service issued tornado warnings Sunday in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.",
    "Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after his patrol car was hit on Interstate 65. At least 600 motorists were stranded in Missouri, that state\u2019s highway patrol said.",
    "Highways in northeastern Kansas were closed due to \u201cimpassable\u201d conditions, according to the state\u2019s Transportation Department. The closures included roughly 220 miles (354 kilometers) of the state\u2019s main artery, Interstate 70, from the Missouri border into central Kansas.",
    "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who declared a state emergency ahead of the storm, said state buildings would be closed Monday.",
    "\u201cWe see far too many wrecks out there for people that do not have to be on the roads, so I want to ask: Stay inside. Stay safe with your family,\u201d the governor said.",
    "Virginia State Police reported at least 135 crashes as the storm entered the state Sunday. A handful of injuries were reported.",
    "In Charleston, West Virginia, where several inches of snow had fallen by Sunday night, authorities urged motorists to stay home. The Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s Office said deputies were responding to crashes and 911 calls countywide. \u201cPlease be patient if you have called 911 for assistance. A deputy will call you or respond to you as soon as possible,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement.",
    "The storms caused havoc for the nation\u2019s passenger railways. More than 20 cancellations were planned on Sunday, 40 for Monday and at least two for Tuesday.",
    "\u201cIf local authorities are telling people not to travel, it\u2019s counterintuitive to try to run a full slate of services when people are being told to stay home,\u201d Amtrak spokesperson Marc Magliari said.",
    "The Midwest was hit especially hard. A train between Chicago and New York and several regional trains between Chicago and St. Louis were among those canceled Sunday.",
    "Nearly 200 flights in and out of St. Louis Lambert International Airport were canceled, according to tracking platform FlightAware.",

    "In Chicago on Sunday, temperatures hovered in the teens (minus 7 to 10 Celsius) and around zero in Minneapolis, while dropping to 11 below (-11.7 Celsius) in International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border.",
    "The Northeastern states are more likely to experience several days of cold following what has mostly been a mild start to winter, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine. A plume of cold air coming down from Canada is likely to result in a cold but dry week, he said.",
    "The cold air will likely grip the eastern half of the country as far south as Georgia, Palmer said, with parts of the East Coast experiencing freezing temperatures and lows dipping into the single digits in some areas.",
    "Wind might also pick up as the week gets going, making for potentially dangerous conditions for people exposed to the elements for long periods of time, Palmer said.",
    "The National Weather Service predicted 8 to 12 inches (about 20 to 30 centimeters) of snow for the Annapolis, Maryland, area. In a statement on X, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm and encouraged residents to vote before the state\u2019s special elections on Tuesday.",
    "Similar declarations were issued in Kansas, Maryland, West Virginia and in central Illinois cities.",
    "School closings were likely to be widespread Monday. Districts in Indiana, Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky were already announcing cancellations and delays on Sunday afternoon.",
    "Kentucky\u2019s Jefferson County Public Schools canceled classes, extracurricular activities and athletics Monday for its nearly 100,000 students. The day would have been students\u2019 first one back after winter break.",
    "\u201cThis is a traditional snow day with no online learning,\u201d the district announced."
