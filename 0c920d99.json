    "In 1816, American missionaries founded the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) in Jaffna. The ACM established missions in other parts of the Jaffna peninsula too.",
    "As a result, on July 22, 1823, the Batticotta Seminary was established in Vaddukoddai to educate students on the peninsula. However, it was closed in 1855.",
    "The alumni of the Batticotta Seminary and other local Christians led a campaign to re-open the seminary and in 1872, Jaffna College was opened on the former seminary site as a successor to the Batticotta Seminary.",
    "Since its inception, Jaffna College has been contributing immensely to the educational advancement, cultural development and economic growth of Jaffna.",

    "\u201cAlthough it is a private school, it has an endowment in the United States of America (US). Jaffna College receives funds for its expenses mainly from two sources. The trustees of the Jaffna College hold funds at Boston in the US. They send a certain portion of their income. The other portion of funds, although a small amount, comes from the fees paid by the students.",
    "\u201cIn order to acknowledge the role of the American missionaries, the American Centre organised a leadership training programme for the senior school prefects on the 22nd and 23rd of August.

The students were able to interact with the ambassador after the event,\u201d said Dr. Thiruwarangan.",
    "Dr. Thiruwarangan noted that compared to many private schools in the country the funds that the students had to contribute to the college for their education was significantly low. \u201cJaffna College is affordable for the people in the locality. The College is located in a village,\u201d Dr. Thiruwarangan noted.",
    "He added, \u201cThe college also has a rich history. From early days onwards, the college has been committed to social justice and was even open for people from marginalised backgrounds. The college aimed at educating children coming from different communities.",
    "In the past, students from the southern part of the country and those who are from the Malaiyaha community joined and received education\u201d.",
    "He said the alumni had organised many events like parades and a worship service to mark the 200th anniversary.",
    "Reminiscing the service the college has been rendering as an educational institution the US-based Ramachandran Kulasingam said, \u201cJaffna College has served the communities for 200 years and has offered a well-rounded education. Jaffna College is known for good English standards. I studied at Jaffna College from 1977-1990. Those were the hard years, the beginnings of the fighting and disturbances due to war,\u201d said Kulasingam.",
    "He noted uplifting everybody was a mission of the Jaffna College.  He said students from all around the country came to study there. \u201cEven the Sinhalese students were there at that time.

    "Jaffna College Principal Ms. Rushira Kulasingham said, \u201cThe people in the area are from a low income group. The American missionaries set up this college to provide quality education to students who cannot afford to go to other private schools. The fee structure is very much lower than the other private schools in Jaffna. Because of the many facilities the college has, students are able to engage not only in academics, but also in extra-curricular activities,\u201d said Kulasingham.",
