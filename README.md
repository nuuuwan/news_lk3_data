Samaranayake’s rambling polemic against environmentalists and in favour of Adani sidesteps the most important issue: transparency

Samaranayake in the Daily FT of 8 July, for instance, observed: “Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.” (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Will-environmentalists-stall-new-50MW-Mannar-wind-power-project/4-763942).

In order to achieve high resources, the tax administration needs public confidence in their duties. The public also needs a fair, equitable, transparent and accountable tax system that aims at implementing good tax principles

There are two certain things with regard to nature in the world. They are Death and Tax. Taxes are the most important source of revenue of the modern Government. It plays a vital role in fulfilling peoples’ aspirations and their rights. Taxation is not a new concept in the modern world.

### Healthy and radiant skin…

*2024-07-10 22:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/healthy-and-radiant-skin/) · `en`

Hi! Thought of giving you something different, this week, for you to try out.

Like me, I know all the lovely ladies like to keep their face…always beautiful.

You will need 01 tablespoon ground flaxseed, 01 tablespoon white flour, 01 teaspoon olive oil, and 02 tablespoons non-sugar yoghurt…yes, plain yoghurt.

In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed with the white flour. Then add the olive oil to the mixture. Next, gradually mix in the 02 tablespoons of non-sugar yoghurt (plain yoghurt). Stir well until you achieve a smooth paste-like consistency.

(You can adjust the consistency of the mask by adding more yoghurt if it’s too thick, or more flour if it’s too runny.)

Wash your face thoroughly with a gentle cleanser and pat dry with a towel.

Apply the mask evenly to your face, avoiding the eye area, and allow the mask to sit on your face for about 15-20 minutes.

Once the time is up, rinse your face with lukewarm water to remove the mask completely.

The stock market turned out to be in a recovery stage yesterday after the market saw an oversell of shares due to a dip in the market for two consecutive sessions. Only 27 Index points were secured in trading as against 160 points down during the last two sessions, market analysts said.

The market was dominated by two crossings; especially that of Agalawatte Plantations, but retail investor participation was significantly low.

Those crossings were reported in Agalawatte Plantations, which crossed 10.9 million shares to the tune of Rs 350 million; its shares traded at Rs 32 and Sampath Bank 300,000 shares crossed for Rs 23.25 million.
