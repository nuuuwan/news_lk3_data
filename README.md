London, (AFP) - James Anderson will bow out as one of cricket's all-time greats when England face West Indies in July after becoming the first pace bowler to take 700 Test wickets.

The 41-year-old will bring down the curtain on a glorious Test career at Lord's, 21 years after his debut, as England head coach Brendon McCullum looks to build for the future with one eye on the 2025-26 Ashes.

"I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said on Saturday.

"But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."

Only two spinners, Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800 Test wickets) and the late Australia great Shane Warne (708), are ahead of Anderson on the all-time list of the five-day game's most successful bowlers.

Anderson joined the exclusive '700 club' in his 187th Test during England's tour of India earlier this year.

The government’s plans to sell off certain national assets and state owned enterprises have given rise to discontent among trade unions, political parties and the general public. The present divestiture drive is ostensibly aimed at minimizing govt. expenditure on loss-making state owned enterprises and meeting certain IMF conditions in that regard. I ruled the country for more than nine years from November 2005 to January 2015 without ever selling a single state owned enterprise. In fact, my government actually re-acquired some state owned enterprises such as the Insurance Corporation, and Lanka Hospitals that had been sold off by previous governments and these enterprises continue to make profits for the state to date.

*2024-05-12 06:19:27* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-2024-presidential-election/) · `en`

The Constitution states that a President who is elected by the people shall hold office for a term of five years. In the event of his death, resignation or removal, his successor shall be elected by Parliament to serve the unexpired period of his term of office. Any Bill that seeks to amend the Constitution to extend the prescribed term of office of the President is required to be passed by Parliament by a two-thirds majority and then approved by the people at a referendum. The Constitution also provides that the poll for the election of the President “shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months” before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office. A popular television channel appears to be unaware of these constitutional requirements when it keeps chanting in the middle of its news programmes: “When is the Election ?”

Under the guidance of the Consultant Family Physician and Senior Registrar of Family Medicine, the Kondavil FHC became a testament to Family Medicine in action. The center boasted a comprehensive array of facilities, from consultation rooms to a dedicated counseling space. Witnessing this well-equipped unit function as a whole solidified the meaning of Family Medicine translating into tangible patient care.

Senthil Thondaman, President of the Ceylon Workers Congress and Governor of the Eastern Province, said there was no compromise with the companies.

Initially, companies said that the salary hike could not be paid when the plantation workers were negotiated on the salary hike.. They said they were ready to pay only the promotion after heavy pressure.

In this case, the state gazette notification has been issued, and now the companies have come forward to pay a base salary of 1,200 rupees.. The company said the company could not even offer a one -rupee salary hike for a year and is now the reason why the government has come up with an increase of 200 rupees.

### The fig leaf of humanitarianism

*2024-05-11 21:23:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-fig-leaf-of-humanitarianism/) · `en`

As each day passes and the death toll rises in Gaza, the West’s complicity in Israeli atrocities becomes clearer and sharper. South Africa’s case against Israel is a clear indictment of the Global North’s inaction regarding those atrocities. Israel’s defence team has attempted to rationalise what Israeli forces are doing in Gaza, but this has effectively been undermined by the Israeli government itself: each day, its official social media channels tweet or post one ridiculous claim against not just South Africa, but also the ICJ.

Against this backdrop, it makes very little sense to continue defending a country against which half the world has rallied in solidarity. Even Sri Lanka’s decision to send vessels to the Red Sea and local youths to Israel does not diminish its continuing support for Palestine at the United Nations, and the Foreign Ministry’s support for a two-state solution, an end to all hostilities, and a humanitarian ceasefire.
