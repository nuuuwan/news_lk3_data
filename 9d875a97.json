  "original_body_lines": [
    "Several internal issues have arisen within the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) as a result of MPs from other political parties crossing over and joining the SJB, political sources said.",
    "It was seen that a number of politicians representing opposition parties as well as several MPs representing the ruling party had joined the SJB during the last few days. However, some of the newly joined members are reportedly being opposed by the members who have been within the party so far.",
    "It is stated that the main reason for this is that the competition for representing the Parliament from the party intensified with the addition of new MPs to the party.",
    "Nevertheless, it was reported that although several politicians joined the alliance of the SJB, the party has only provided the SJB\u2019s membership to Jayarathne Herath, Chandima Weerakkody, Shan Wijayalal and Dayasritha Tissera.",
    "When inquired by Ada Derana in this regard, a leading member of the SJB stated that despite the existence of different ideologies, the party is working to resolve the issues through discussions.",
    "He also mentioned that more powerful MPs will join the party in the near future, adding that there have been several discussions regarding the matter."
