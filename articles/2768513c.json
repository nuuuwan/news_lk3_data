    "The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday approved terminating the services of officers and consultants appointed on contract basis, effective from 30 September 2024.",
    "These contract-based appointments were originally made to establish two key entities \u2013 the \u2018Office for the Affairs of Sri Lankans Abroad\u2019 under the President\u2019s Office and the \u2018National Peoples Council\u2019 which was set up to enhance public participation in democracy alongside the implementation of the \u2018Agriculture Modernisation Program\u2019. \u201cThe Government now believes that the functions anticipated from these offices and programs can be successfully carried out by the respective Ministries and Provincial Councils. Therefore, it was decided to discontinue the contract-based appointments,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday."
