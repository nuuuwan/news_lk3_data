    "St. Joseph\u2019s College Head Coach Nilfer Ibrahim, who was assaulted by a spectator after their game against Kingswood College and was admitted to the General Hospital in Peradeniya was discharged late in the evening today.",
    "Mahesh Senanayake, President of Kingswood Rugby Union (KRU), speaking to Daily Mirror said, \u201cWe are really sorry for what happened to Nilfer and we have great respect for him as a player and coach. This incident took place 20 minutes after the game concluded and this has no connection with the match results. We will never approve such a low level of behavior and we are seeking from the Schools Section if we could ban them for attending any of the home matches conducted by Kingswood College. Further we will tighten up our security for the remaining home matches.",
    "Ibrahim, speaking to Daily Mirror, said, \u201cI was in Peradeniya General Hospital receiving treatment for the last two days for the injury on my knee and hand when I was assaulted by a spectator after the match in Pallekele on Sunday (July 9). I was discharged today (July 10). The Hospital Police recorded my case in their books.\u201d\u00a0 (Shamseer Jaleel)"
