    "The approval rating of the government fell from 9% in October 2023 to 7% in February 2024, according to the latest round of the Gallup style \u2018Mood of the Nation\u2019 poll of Verit\u00e9 Research.",
    "The survey showed that only 9% rated the current economic conditions as either excellent or good, which is a drop from 16% in October 2023.",
    "Ninety percent thought that the economic conditions in the country were getting worse, whereas in October 2023 only 66% had this negative view.",
    "To the question, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way the current government is working?\u201d, Seven percent (almost 7.5%) of the respondents said that they approve (with an error margin of \u00b1 1.81%). The percentage saying they disapproved was 85%. The approval rating is its lowest since June 2022.",
    "When asked to \u201cRate the economic conditions in the country today\u201d as either excellent, good or poor, 91% said it was poor (with an error margin of \u00b11.94%). This is an increase in the negative rating from 73% in June 2023 and 81% in October 2023.",
    "To the question \u201cDo you think that the economic conditions in the country as a whole are getting better or getting worse?\u201dNine percent of the respondents believed that the economy was getting better (with an error margin of \u00b1 1.91%). It was 8% in October 2023. However, the percentage that thinks it is getting worse has increased from 66% in October 2023 to 90% at present; suggesting that those who didn\u2019t take a firm view in October 2023 have now taken the view that it is getting worse.",
    "This regularly conducted poll is part of the Syndicated Surveys instrument of Verit\u00e9 Research. The polling partner was Vanguard Survey (Pvt) Ltd. This instrument also provides other organisations the opportunity to survey the sentiments of Sri Lankans.",
    "The latest poll was based on a nationally representative multi-stage randomised sample of 1,044 Sri Lankan adults from separate households and was carried out from February 16 to 25, 2024. This survey was designed to have a maximum sampling error margin of \u00b13.03% at a 95% confidence level. Error margins can be further affected by lapses that could arise in the process of implementation."
