    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena relinquished his position as Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday, paving the way for Acting Chairperson Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to take over the role.",
    "The decision was announced at a special SLFP Executive Committee meeting held in Kotte by the Pro-Sirisena faction of the party yesterday morning.",
    "The party said a unanimous decision was reached to appoint Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the new Chairman.",
    "During a similar Executive Committee meeting on 21 April, Rajapakshe was appointed as the Acting Chairperson of the SLFP under the leadership of former President Maithripala Sirisena.",
    "However, on 24 April, the Colombo District Court issued an injunction barring Rajapakshe from carrying out his duties as the Acting Chairperson of the SLFP.",

    "On 8 April, the SLFP faction led by former party leader Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, party office bearers Duminda Dissanayake, Mahinda Amaraweera and Lasantha Alagiyawanna appointed SLFP Senior Vice President Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party\u2019s Acting Chairman.",

    "He said Ekanayake has no legal authority or right to convene such a meeting and therefore the gathering has no legitimacy and contravenes the party\u2019s constitution.",
    "\u201cDecisions taken at such meetings have no validity before the law and are therefore null and void,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake also noted that the meeting held has also violated the injunction orders issued by the Courts in cases relating to the SLFP leadership. He also demanded Ekanayake to refrain from convening such meetings in the future."
