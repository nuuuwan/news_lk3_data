    "Specialist Dr. Shafi Sihabdeen has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Public Security today (07).",

    "Speaking to reporters outside the ministry after making the complaint, Dr. Shafi stated that he had endured immense anguish over a period of five years and six months.",
    "\u201cIt was not me who was freed yesterday.\u00a0 It was everyone who stood for justice. I have a duty to do, to make sure that no one else is faced with this injustice.\u201d",
    "\u201cI filed a complaint against all those who acted against me. They looked for complaints after arresting me. Myself, my children and wife, were subjected to immense pressure,\u201d he added.",
    "Dr. Shafi was acquitted from all charges by the Kurunegala Magistrate\u2019s Court yesterday (6) when the the case against him, over charges of allegedly amassing assets through suspicious means, performing illegal sterilization surgeries and having links to terrorist activities, was taken up for hearing.",
