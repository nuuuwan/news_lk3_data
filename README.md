“We have friendly relations with Sri Lanka and want to amicably resolve the trade disputes,” said Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal.

### More support for SLPP, UNP than either party’s presidential candidate: IHP poll

ECONOMYNEXT — There is substantially more support for the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) than there is for either party’s presidential candidate, the Institute for Health Policy (IHP)’s monthly poll has found.

(IHP)’s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) polling director Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya was quoted as saying in a statement from the institute that its parliamentary election voting intent survey has revealed “substantially more support for the SLPP in a general election than for their presidential candidate, and similarly more support for Wickremesinghe’s presidential candidacy than for the UNP”.

“It would be unwise to write off the SLPP as a political force, since many SLPP voters appeared in August to be switching their presidential vote to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Of course, they could also do this using their second preference votes, which suggests limited voter understanding of that option,” he said.
