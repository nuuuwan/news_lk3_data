### Seven reasons why I would not vote for a socialist utopia

*2024-05-10 05:39:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Seven-reasons-why-I-would-not-vote-for-a-socialist-utopia/4-761621) · `en`

Effectively steering the economic agenda of an entire nation requires an entirely different skill set

There is a certain age that socialism sounds super sweet. Who wouldn’t appreciate a system in which everyone lives merrily, receives free education and healthcare, shares their food with others, and experiences a sense of community and compassion? Who would not want a highly paying government job whether you study hard or not?

In this ideal society, there are no grievances about the contributions made for the greater good. Individuals are duly recognised with bronze medals for their exemplary efforts. We hold admiration for the industriousness displayed in factories and fields, where the masses work diligently and joyfully express their solidarity through revolutionary songs. We applaud when a leader reminiscent of Lenin emphasises that the best things are for the children. Truly, this superlative utopia leaves no room for comparison.

### Sri Lankan elections and an Indian Ocean tug-of-war

The aim of these states is to partner with Sri Lanka and create a positive opinion in the eyes of the people and those in governance as they continue their tug-of-war with China

In the lead up to Sri Lanka’s Presidential election in October 2024, there have been numerous visits by foreign governments to create a good rapport with the various candidates. Visits by great powers to Sri Lanka appear to be a tradition before a national election or during global calamities. My analyses over the years indicate an increase in the frequency of interactions and their breadth during the visits.

In order to ascertain this tug-of-war, this article is divided into three sections: first, the QUAD visits; second, the Chinese engagements, and third Sri Lanka’s future in the Indian Ocean.

The importance of entrepreneurs as the backbone of our economy should be recognised and honoured

Sri Lanka has been through an unprecedented macroeconomic crisis with a complete economic meltdown since 2022 resulting from years of financial mismanagement, and the current global recession resulted from the scarring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and many other factors. To date, the country indicates signs of stabilisation but, still faces challenges with elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labour market concerns.

Given these challenges, the Government needs to carefully plan monetary and fiscal policies and implement growth-enhancing structural reforms to emerge from the current economic crisis, while laying the foundation for improving long-term green, resilient, and inclusive growth prospects. Future generations desperately require us to develop our country to give them a chance to live a comfortable life when it becomes their turn.

### Plantation workers' salary increase -Harini Amarasuriya

*2024-05-10 02:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183101) · `ta`

Harini Amarasuriya criticizes the government's plan to increase plantation workers' daily wage to 1700 rupees, arguing it's a deceptive move. She suggests changing the basic salary instead. The government's gazette notification, she claims, is a ploy to mislead workers, as plantation companies are likely to challenge it. She also criticizes an amendment aimed at protecting night-shift women workers, arguing it fails to address their real issues like transport facilities.

🟩

Gazette Notification on Plantation Workers' Salary Increase Action. National People's Power Member Harini Amarasuriya said the government should change their basic salary if they need to carry out a salary increase.

He said this while addressing the debate on the Parliament on Thursday (9).

The government has issued a gazette notification to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to 1700 rupees. This is the play that deceives workers. If the government is increasing the salaries of plantation workers, they must change their basic salary and thereby convert the base salary to 1700 rupees.

On the contrary. Salary Increase is a play -labeled play by the president on May 1st. Everyone, including the President and the Minister of Labor, know that plantation companies go to court against the gazette notification. They know that this cannot be implemented.

So the salary increase for plantation workers is a gazette notification to mislead the plantation workers and deceive them.

### How filmmakers and lawmakers view people’s trust - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-10 01:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/How-filmmakers-and-lawmakers-view-peoples-trust-EDITORIAL/172-282288) · `en`

Sri Lankans may be wary of trusting their instincts given their bad experiences with politicians. This is a country where the majority of the citizenry hasn’t had the fortune of receiving a university education. Hence, for some of them, trust must be built on instinct.

This instinct is the tool people relied on when electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa as president. He was the last Executive of this country who was elected through the vote of the people. The instinct in people that this president would deliver proved the former horribly wrong.

This is a country where its regime initiates programmes in a hurry and then repents. The latest is the new visa system where users are subject to paying higher fees. The new visa portal- which operates online- replaces the old system where visas were issued more efficiently through an Electronic Travel Authorization system. Now there is all-round criticism aimed at the new visa system.

The bonds of issuers that are very close to default show little distinction between ‘RR4’ and ‘RR6’ recoveries. Therefore, Fitch has not assigned a Recovery Rating to the bond.

The temperature of the sea should be fluctuated at 27-28 degrees Celsius for the formation of coral reefs.

He pointed out that if the current increased temperature lasts a month or more, coral reefs are expected to be destroyed.

When the heat of seawater increases more than usual, corals lose their color and begin to bleed. This will help you know the destruction of coral reefs. If the coral reefs are destroyed, a large number of marine life, including fish, will be affected. ”. Remble

The legality of a non-citizen serving as a political party secretary in Sri Lanka is unclear due to the lack of legal reference requiring party officers to be citizens.

A non-citizen of Sri Lanka is the secretary of a political party, how is the legal situation?Former Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya made this statement to the question.

"The Elections Commission has not been able to check whether officers of political parties are Sri Lankan citizens. There is no legal reference to that it is needed. I do not think that the post of Mrs. Diana Gamage is a serious interruption to the legalization of the party. "

### Ignoring The Whale, While Hooking The Sprat

Every Party manifesto and every government statement, solemnly vows to eradicate poverty, but have not done so, for seventy six years, since Independence in 1948. The performance of the present government is no better. Since we are hailed (mostly by ourselves) as a “Star Class Democracy,” that has changed governments peacefully. Despite the record of (language riots of 1958), the attempted (coup of 1962) youth insurrections of (1971 and 1988 to 1989) and the civil war (1983-2009).

Changes of government “by the ballot, and not by the bullet”. One hopes that the failures are indicative of poor planning, and not the lack of skill in handling explosives. The fact that there have been repeated changes of governments, means that all political parties have to share the blame. I do not believe that any Party has “won” an election, but rather that the preceding one was kicked out by a disappointed electorate.
