    "The Group sustained its positive trajectory from the previous year, delivering a resilient performance for the quarter achieving a cumulative revenue of Rs. 28.5\u202fbillion. Operating profit and earnings grew by 6.9 % and 26.1% respectively, reaching Rs.\u202f2.1\u202fbillion and Rs.\u202f1.2 billion for the quarter. The year on year improvement in Group earnings was driven by stronger topline growth, improved gross profit margins, and reduced finance costs. Revenue in the Consumer Brands Sector recorded a marginal decline compared to the previous year, primarily due to the impact of prior-year strategic price adjustments.",
