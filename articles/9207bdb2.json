    "The history of this abode is both historic and tragic concerning the life of Lorenz. The origins of this abode are unknown. Its structure is essentially Dutch but its occupants of various eras have made their additions to its architectural setting. Lorenz had been eyeing this property for some time. Previously, it was owned by Governor Charles McCarthy\u2019s brother. Just like  Elie House, this property opposite the Welikada Prison was situated at a higher elevation in comparison with its surroundings. Originally this property was in two blocks of land covering 11.5 acres. After purchasing this property from Dr. Dickman and Dr. Wambeek, Charles Lorenz, who was mortally ill arrived here in early 1871. Sadly, this would be his final abode as Lorenz passed away in August 1871.",
    "In the maps of Colombo since the time Lorenz moved to this abode, this property has been called Karlsruhe. The name Karlsruhe  certainly has connections with Germany, which has a city by that name. This term translates to \u201cCharles\u2019 peace\u201d. Charles Lorenz who named this abode Karlsruhe knew his days were numbered and may have had the thought that this would be the place where he would receive his eternal rest.",
    "The tall pillars and long front veranda are at the outset the most striking feature of this home. However, the most striking feature of the house is the Satinwood Screen, separating the sitting and dining rooms is the highlight of the bungalow. The screen, built into the archway is 8 x 12 ft and has elaborately decorated panels on either side with a background in the acanthus panel standing out in a different style. The letter L is for Lorenz on the left, and K is for Karlsruhe on the right. Originally, these panels were the doors of the screen",
    "Lorenz, who had great taste in Dutch furniture, adorned his house with the finest furniture at the time. These were carefully studied by R. L. Brohier when he published his monumental tome, Dutch Furniture of Ceylon in 1969. When Lorenz wrote his will in mid-1871, he bestowed  Karlsruhe to Eliza Labrooy, the housekeeper of Lorenz and companion of Eleanor Nell. With the untimely death of Lorenz and his wife within a couple of months in 1871, Eliza became the owner of Karlsruhe. Eliza who would pass away in 1895, sold the property to Louise Pieris. At the turn of the century, Pieris sold the land in several portions. The Methodist Mission in Ceylon acquired four acres of it, including the bungalow. Today this property belongs to Wesley College, which this year completed its 150th year. The  Karlsruhe Bungalow, which is well preserved to date by Wesley College housed its early Principals.",
    "After Lorenz was sent to Colombo by his father for studies at the Colombo Academy, he lived with his sister and brother-in-law, John Drieberg in their house by the Colombo Kachcheri. Lorenz was given his own room in this house and most of his friends from the Academy visited him there. It was in this long room that Lorenz and his band practised for their performances in the 1840s and early 1850s. By the time Lorenz was working for his brother-in-law as an apprentice as well as during his marriage to Eleanor Nell, he lived in a house in Sea Street, Colombo Fort. This area was highly regarded as a respectable residential quarter in Colombo during this era. (cf. Van der Waal, E. H.,  Ceylon Causerie, 1933 July, p. 31) This house in Sea Street belonged to Eleanor. Between the years 1853 and 1855, Lorenz and his wife lived in England. Here he took lodgings in Kensington Park, which was a pleasant area in London. E. H. Van der Waal comments on this as follows:",
    "\u201cWe could picture him walking down its quiet streets or taking the air in Kensington Garden and Hyde Park. Probably he lingered as one sometimes does near Kensington Palace, the home of Queen Victoria in childhood, or sat on a seat by the Round Pond watching the toy argosies making their perilous voyage to the opposite shore.\u201d",
    "When Governor Henry Ward appointed Lorenz as the District Judge for Chilaw in 1855, he took residence in one of the Government houses in that district. However, it was during this time that Lorenz started purchasing some of the more opulent properties and houses in Colombo and its outskirts.",

    "Based on the Will of C. A. Lorenz dated April 13, 1871 (a copy of this document is available at the Royal Asiatic Society Library), attested by J. A. Martinez Notary Public, the immovable properties of the former and their value in 1871 are mentioned below:",
    "3. Nine acres of land at Maradana with two houses called respectively \u201cGatherum Castle\u201d and \u201cHermitage\u201d 3,000",
    "4. A house and two acres of ground in Borella occupied by G. W. R. Campbell 1,000",
    "8. \u201cTeak\u201d\u2018 Bungalow situated at Kalutara and 100 acres of land 700",
    "By the time of his death, C. A. Lorenz was one of the wealthiest men in Colombo. The previous description covered some of the houses he owned. Along with several high-profile properties, Lorenz owned houses carrying some unique and original Dutch period and early British period Architecture. Lorenz who was methodical in almost all of his endeavours realized that he must draft his Last Will as there seemed no remedy for his illness. At this time his wife too was gravely ill and Lorenz fathomed that her days were numbered as well. Keeping this in mind as well as being fair as he had been his whole life, Lorenz drafted his Will in such a way that his closest relations and friends were well rewarded. Most of his assets were divided among Eliza Labrooy (his housekeeper) and Eleanor Nell Lorenz.",
    "Accordingly, after Eleanor\u2019s death, the properties, furniture and other useful materials were passed on to Eliza and were to be shared among Lorenz\u2019s adopted daughter, Maud Nell. Lorenz listed all his furniture and utensils along with their value in his Will. He had amassed a good collection of ebony, calamander, satinwood, jack wood and teak furniture. These were rare and expensive possessions and had to be labelled in his Will.",
    "Maud Nell married Frederick John de Saram of F. J. & G. de Saram fame. Most of the furniture passed on to Maud remained with her till her death in 1936. Among the furniture Maud inherited from Lorenz were three uncommon but very finely crafted book cabinets inscribed in silver letterings as Historica, Theologia and Humaniora on its fa\u00e7ade below the cornice. R. L. Brohier estimates that these cabinets built in Dutch lines were from the early 19th century. These were custom-built for Lorenz or whoever owned it previously for their collection of books on the subjects of history, theology and humanities.",
    "After Maud\u2019s death, two cabinets: Humaniora and  Theologica were inherited by her son, Leslie de Saram, who was one of the most prominent collectors of antiquarian matter in Ceylon as well as a reputed connoisseur. The Humaniora remains in the office of F. J. de Saram in Colombo to date. Theologica was donated to the University of Peradeniya along with many antiques and books of de Saram. It is believed to remain in the University\u2019s Library. Historica found its way to the Felix Dias Bandaranaike family and was in the procession of S. J. F. Dias Bandaranaike (father of Prof. Yasmin Gunaratne) in 1968. (See Brohier, R. L., (1968),  Furniture of the Dutch Period in Ceylon, p. 30)",
