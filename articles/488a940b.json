  "original_body_lines": [
    "Japan\u2019s ruling party picked conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi as its new head on Saturday, putting her on course to become the country\u2019s first female prime minister.",
    "The Liberal Democratic Party elected Takaichi, 64, to regain trust from a public angered by rising prices and drawn to opposition groups promising big stimulus and clampdowns on foreigners.",
    "A vote in parliament to choose a prime minister to replace Shigeru Ishiba is expected to be held on October 15.",
    "The new LDP president is likely to succeed Shigeru Ishiba as leader of the world\u2019s fourth-biggest economy because the party, which has governed Japan for almost all the postwar period, is the biggest in parliament. But this is not assured as the party and its coalition partner lost their majorities in both houses under Ishiba in the past year.",
    "Takaichi, the only woman among the five LDP candidates, beat a challenge from the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, who was bidding to become the country\u2019s youngest leader in the modern era.",
    "A former internal affairs minister with an expansionary economic agenda, Takaichi inherits a party in crisis.",
    "Various other parties, including the fiscally expansionist Democratic Party for the People and the anti-immigration Sanseito have been steadily luring voters, especially younger ones, away from the LDP.",
    "\u201cRecently, I have heard harsh voices from across the country saying we don\u2019t know what the LDP stands for anymore,\u201d said Takaichi in her speech before the second-round vote.",
    "\u201cThat sense of urgency drove me. I wanted to turn people\u2019s anxieties about their daily lives and the future into hope,\u201d she added.",
    "Takaichi, who says her hero is Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister, offered a starker vision for change than Koizumi and is potentially more disruptive.",
    "An advocate of late premier Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d strategy to jolt the economy with aggressive spending and easy monetary policy, she has previously criticised the Bank of Japan\u2019s interest rate increases.",
    "Such a policy shift could spook investors worried about one of the world\u2019s biggest debt loads.",
    "Takaichi has also raised the possibility of redoing an investment deal with U.S. President Donald Trump that lowered his punishing tariffs in return for Japanese taxpayer-backed investment.",
    "Her nationalistic positions - such as her regular visits to the Yasukuni shrine to Japan\u2019s war dead, viewed by some Asian neighbours as a symbol of its past militarism - may rile South Korea and China.",
    "She also favours revising Japan\u2019s pacifist postwar constitution and suggested this year that Japan could form a \u201cquasi-security alliance\u201d with Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China.",
    "If elected, Takaichi said she would travel overseas more regularly than her predecessor to spread the word that \u201cJapan is Back!\u201d",
    "Takaichi is expected to hold a press conference around 0900 GMT."
