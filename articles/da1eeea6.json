These efforts aim to help SMEs integrate into the global value chains while reducing their environmental impact. Cochin also highlighted the importance of sustainability and climate resilience in trade.

This includes initiatives on decarbonisation, which aim to reduce the carbon footprint of trade activities through innovative approaches and sustainable practices.",
