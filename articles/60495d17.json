    "Sunshine Holdings PLC Group Chief Executive Officer Shyam Sathasivam said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a strong start to FY26, delivering double-digit growth in revenue and profit, underpinned by the strategic groundwork laid last year. This performance reflects improving macroeconomic conditions, a modest consumer recovery, and also the strength of our diversified portfolio alongside focused execution across sectors. Healthcare remains a key growth engine, with investments underway in manufacturing, distribution, and diagnostics. In Consumer, the recovery is gaining momentum, driving renewed efforts in brand building, innovation, and export expansion. Agribusiness continues to demonstrate strong fundamentals, supported by stable pricing and cost efficiencies. Across the Group, we remain committed to long-term value creation through targeted investment and operational resilience.\u201d",
    "During the period in review, Group\u2019s Healthcare sector posted revenue of Rs. 8.6 billion, an increase of 14% YoY backed by expansion across the agency, distribution, and retail pharmacy verticals.

    "The consumer sector reported a 3.7% YoY increase in revenue to close at Rs. 4.8 billion in 1QFY26, backed by improvements in both the domestic and export markets. Local consumer business showcased strong performance with an improved revenue growth of 4.5% YoY, driven primarily by a strong recovery in the confectionery segment, where its revenues grew 19.9% YoY, supported by both value and volume improvements.

Despite the contraction in dairy, the Agribusiness EBIT margin expanded to 48.8% in 1QFY26, up from 38.8% in the same period last year, driven by top-line growth in palm oil and sustained cost efficiencies in palm oil operations."
