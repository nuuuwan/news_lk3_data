    "According to the commission, representatives may follow the vehicle carrying the ballot boxes up to the last police checkpoint near the counting center.",

    "A vehicle license for this purpose can be obtained from the Senior Polling Officer at the relevant polling station.",
    "This decision comes in response to doubts expressed about whether the ballot boxes will be delivered to the counting center without any tampering after the polls close, the commission said.",
