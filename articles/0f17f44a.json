    "\u201cThe Prime Minister felt betrayed. She was embarrassed, bitter and angry. She was sensitive to Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s feelings\u201d",
    "Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.",
    "That is why they need to be assisted by mature and highly competent staff work. This places an immense responsibility on the public service and it requires high quality team work from the service. One major slip can bring disaster, whereas sound and consistent work can correspondingly result in many benefits. There is also the fact that good governance requires an effective public service, whose collective experience and institutional memory should be tapped. In a changing political scenario, the role of a good public service is to provide stability and a degree of continuity.",
    "In order to achieve this the public service must develop the capacity for high quality analysis and the selection of possible options based on this analysis. In the case of the important letter (to Mrs. Indira Gandhi mentioned last week) submitted for the Prime Minister\u2019s signature that had not happened. She had been presented in a busy moment with just one choice. With a heap of another 40 to 50 files awaiting her attention; with other appointments and deadlines approaching; and with a substantial number of telephone calls distracting her attention and disturbing her concentration, it was not a surprise that the letter was signed.",
    "At the level of the Prime Minister, and now the President, the consequences of shoddy work can be quite serious. That is why a partnership based on objectivity, competence, professionalism and trust is necessary between a public service of highly competent officials and the political leadership of the country. If such institutional arrangements are inadequate, or do not work, efficiency, effectiveness and opportunity will suffer and a country\u2019s overall prospects will be diminished to that extent.",
    "The discussions with India continued at official levels. They began sometime in 1973 when the Prime Minister was returning from a visit to Yugoslavia where she was taking treatment from time to time for a bad knee. On her return she had come via Delhi and met Mrs. Gandhi. There, at the political level two important decisions had been taken. An agreement was to be signed confirming Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty of the island of Katchativu and also demarcating the maritime boundary between the two countries.",
    "Furthermore, the two Prime Ministers had agreed to solve the question of the balance 150,000 of the people of Indian origin in Sri Lanka, on the basis of India absorbing 75,000 and their natural increase, and Sri Lanka, the balance 75,000 with their natural increase. The Prime Minister told me that because of sensitive domestic political reasons the Indian Prime Minister wanted this kept secret for a period of about six months.",
    "In the meantime, two small selected groups, one in India and one in Sri Lanka were to liaise and draw up the maps, charts and legal documents to give effect to these decisions. The Prime Minister wanted WT Jayasinghe and me to handle matters on our side. She was not going to inform anybody else, certainly no one at the political level, not even her Cabinet. It was vital that nothing leaked out. WT and I set to work. His considerable expertise in Indo-Sri Lanka issues proved to be very useful.",
    "As we proceeded, with the Prime Minister\u2019s approval the Attorney General Victor Tennekoon Q.C. was brought into deal with the legal issues, and a relatively young Assistant Superintendent of Surveys Mr. Herath, was brought on board to handle the maps and charts that had to be drawn up to demarcate the maritime boundary. He was later to become Surveyor General. All were well briefed on the necessity for absolute secrecy.",
    "WT occasionally visited India and a few Indian officials occasionally visited Sri Lanka on these matters. Our team had several meetings among ourselves to meticulously produce the varied drafts that were necessary. In due course, the date for the simultaneous signing of the agreements in Delhi and Colombo was fixed. There were to be two sets of originals. WT was to go to Delhi and have the documents signed by the Indian Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Kewal Singh was to come to Colombo with the other set and get them signed by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. This signing was to take place simultaneously in Colombo and Delhi at a given time during late morning.",
    "I had been reminding the Prime Minister that the Cabinet had to be informed and their formal approval obtained for these agreements, and also that the President Mr. William Gopallawa had to be briefed. The President was briefed by her earlier, but she was going to inform the Cabinet only at 9 a.m. on the morning of the signing at a special Cabinet meeting called for this purpose. The arrangement between the two countries was that an official communique was to be released immediately after the signing, simultaneously in Delhi and Colombo.",
    "The Indians were sensitive to any information leaking out before that. The Prime Minister in turn did not want to risk informing a large Cabinet of Ministers, about these developments until almost the last moment. Information on various matters had been leaking out from the Cabinet periodically, and she was aware of certain friendships between some of her Ministers and certain newspapermen. Therefore, she did not want to take a chance.",
    "When WT went to Delhi with the documents, I became Acting Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs. WT briefed me and said that the Indian Foreign Secretary would be coming after a stop over in Bangalore, by a special Indian Airforce flight at 11.00 in the night to the Ratmalana airport. He wanted me to personally meet the Foreign Secretary, put him in my car and take him personally to the suite booked for him at the Hotel (Ceylon) Intercontinental. He emphasized that I should do exactly as he had said and extend these courtesies because Kewal Singh and he enjoyed very good personal relations and that the Indian Foreign Secretary had been \u201cmost gracious\u201d to him.",
    "I therefore, followed his instructions to the letter. I was at Ratmalana airport on a dark night and greeted the Indian Foreign Secretary on his arrival. By that time I had informed the Acting High Commissioner for India of the travel arrangements for Mr. Kewal Singh in my car. The Indian High Commissioner had proceeded to Delhi for the signing. Everything went according to schedule, and I got back home during the early hours of the morning after leaving the Foreign Secretary in the hotel.",
    "The next morning the Cabinet was called into session at very short notice. The Prime Minister had informed Alif the Cabinet Secretary, at something like 6 o\u2019clock in the morning to summon the Cabinet at 9 a.m. Mr. Alif was naturally somewhat alarmed at this unexpected emergency meeting and had wanted to know what to tell the Ministers. The Prime Minister had merely said, that she would personally inform them when they met. A nonplussed Mr. Alif next telephoned me. In order to allay his anxiety, I could only tell him that the Prime Minister probably would be conveying some good news, but that beyond that I was unable to say anything.",
    "The Cabinet duly met at 9 a.m. The announcement had been made amidst great jubilation. Special kiribath was served. The Cabinet passed a vote of appreciation and thanks on the Prime Minister\u2019s achievement, and a few minutes before 10 a.m. the meeting was over. The signing was to be around 11.30 a.m. By about 10.45 a.m., I received a frantic call from WT in Delhi. Information about the agreements, the time of signing and various other details were coming over the Press Trust of India telex machines from Colombo!",
    "A distressed WT was asking me, how in these circumstances, he was going to face Mrs. Gandhi! This was greatly shocking. Extremely sensitive and important issues that had been kept absolutely secret by the Prime Minister and by a maximum of about five or six public servants for well over a year, whilst actually working on the subjects were out in public and had reached New Delhi within half an hour of a Cabinet meeting. The Prime Minister felt betrayed. She was embarrassed, bitter and angry. She was sensitive to Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s feelings.",
    "We were quite depressed. I was particularly distressed at the unenviable and embarrassing position WT was in Delhi. But the damage was done. The only saving grace was the sympathetic understanding of Foreign Secretary Kewal Singh in Colombo, and as WT related later, the magnanimity of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Delhi. Mrs. Bandaranaike took quite a while to get over what was to her, a nasty experience.",
    "The year 1975 was a busy and significant. In January, The Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies was inaugurated. This Centre which was to focus on all aspects of international studies, including international law; international economics; elements of diplomacy and foreign languages was named after Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike. The inaugural lecture was given by the distinguished Indian Civil Servant and Diplomat Shri KPS. Menon.",
    "Abolition of the Sri Lanka Overseas Service under \u201cany other business\u201d triggered a case of apoplexy.",
    "It was during the first half of 1975 that the Cabinet took a most astonishing decision. I was not aware of it until the Director General of Foreign Affairs, Vernon Mendis suddenly burst into my room. When I looked at his face, I instantly understood what apoplexy looked like. Vernon was red in the face and almost incoherent. Speech was clearly difficult, and this was alarming in the case of one who was usually fluent of expression and grand and sweeping in style, a style in fact which seemed to irritate some.",
    "I asked him to sit. But he wouldn\u2019t. He was too agitated for that. Once he was capable of rational discourse he asked me \u201cDo you know, that the Cabinet has abolished the Sri Lanka Overseas Service under \u201cAny other business?\u201d It was now my turn to be struck dumb. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Vernon assured me it was true and thought that Tissa Wijeratne was behind it. Vernon\u2019s information was that some LSSP ministers had raised the issue, that it was not necessary to have two services, an administrative service and an overseas service, and that officers should be able to move between the two services. This was thought to be beneficent to both services in that selected officers of both, would be exposed both to domestic and foreign issues and experience thereby deepening the maturity and skills of the senior public service as a whole.",
    "After further discussions, the Cabinet had decided to abolish the overseas service. It was also believed that this result was achieved through canvassing by certain well placed members of the administrative service who had political connections. The charge was that they were seeking a short cut to foreign travel and foreign assignments in a climate of stringent foreign exchange restrictions and severely curtailed opportunities for travel abroad.",
    "Whatever the truth or otherwise of all these, it was a decision seriously detrimental to the conduct of our foreign relations and over time an end to the specialization and expertise built-up in the Foreign Ministry through several decades. It would also have opened us to a degree of international ridicule. There were undoubtedly, inefficient lazy and even venal officers in the overseas service. But such examples were not confined to the overseas service. In any case, if that was seen to be the problem, the remedy was not to abolish the entire service, but to deal with the deadwood.",
    "Vernon, WT and I spoke to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet decision was rescinded. I told the Prime Minister that I was very surprised that this had happened at a time when she was both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The decision however, had been taken at the tail end of a four hour Cabinet meeting when obviously the powers of concentration were seriously reduced, and the Ministers had succumbed to some ostensibly attractive arguments. During the course of my career I was to see other surprising decisions taken by other Cabinets under the agenda item \u201cAny other business.\u201d This item sometimes seemed to stimulate leaps of imagination unrelated to any basis in reality.",
    "Speaking of apoplexy, the other such episode I witnessed during this period related to Dr. Mackie Ratwatte. He too burst into my room, face on fire, and incoherent of expression. In the case of Mackie, it was all the more astonishing, because no one had imagined possibilities of such athletic energy in what was a sedate personality. What had set off the condition in this case was a young man, from the Prime Minister\u2019s electorate of Attanagalla. He had been coming to see Dr. Ratwatte at least two or three times a week for months, begging to be placed in any kind of employment. At last Dr. Ratwatte had found a temporary job for him as a watcher at the Film Corporation.",
    "Three days later, (the day on which Dr. Ratwatte came charging into my room,) the person had turned up and requested him to find him another job, complaining there were so many mosquitoes in the night in the Film Corporation premises that he could not sleep a wink! And this was supposed to be a watcher! Mere banishment of the delinquent from his presence was not sufficient for Mackie. He simply had to share his sense of outrage with someone. Hence his apoplectic presence before me. I had to stop all work and listen patiently to him until catharsis was achieved.",
