    "Due to the continuous delay of SriLankan Airlines flights, sending workers for Korean jobs has become a serious problem, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.",
    "A group of workers to Korea could not be sent today due to the delay of flight UL 470 for about 12 hours.",
    "As the 800th group to leave for Korean jobs, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) had prepared all the necessary arrangements to send this group to South Korea.",
    "Fifty-two workers were supposed to leave for work in the fishing industry in Korea. Due to the delay of the flight, the Korean Human Resources Department has informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau not to send them to Korea today.",
    "On May 23 too a Sri Lankan Airlines flight was similarly delayed and the Human Resources Department of Korea refused to accept the Sri Lankan workers who were to leave for Korea on that flight.",
    "With the intervention of the SLBFE, the workers were dispatched to Korea on June 4, but the flight was delayed for two hours on that day as well.",
    "Minister Nanayakkara has strongly emphasized that decisions will be taken by focusing on this matter. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
