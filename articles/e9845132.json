    "It has been reported that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is due to visit India during the latter part of December.\u00a0 He and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to have talks on grant assistance projects from India, debt restructuring, people centric digitisation (identity cards, for instance), finality of the Economic and Technological Co-operation Agreement (ECTA), housing projects from India, solar electrification of religious places, agricultural development, defence cooperation, infrastructure development in the North and collaboration in human resource development.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Dissanayake is expected to raise with Premier Modi the issue of Indian fishermen fishing in Sri Lanka\u2019s territorial waters\u201d (Sunday Times, December 1, 2024).",
    "It is clear from the foregoing report that the scale and scope of India\u2019s agenda overwhelmingly outweighs Sri Lanka\u2019s agenda that is limited to a single issue, namely, \u201cIndian fishermen fishing in Sri Lanka\u2019s territorial waters\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding this serious imbalance, Sri Lanka could gain considerable mileage by expanding the scope of this single issue in its agenda to two issues that would make a significant impact not only to Sri Lanka\u2019s security and its national interests but also to the wellbeing of the Sri Lankan fishing community.",
    "1\u00a0\u00a0 Reparations for the damages inflicted on Sri Lanka\u2019s marine resources by bottom trawling and the loss of revenue and wellbeing to Sri Lanka and its fishing community over decades.",
    "2\u00a0\u00a0 The need to revisit existing maritime boundaries agreed to between India and Sri Lanka, which are based on historical practices and instead, establish fresh Maritime Boundaries based on International law recognized by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) relating to International Boundaries.",
    "These two issues are interlinked because it is the determination of the international boundary, based on International Law, that becomes the basis to establish claims for Reparations. Therefore, it is only by establishing the location of the International Boundary, based on a judgment by the ICJ, that lawful assessment of the claim for Reparations could be established.",
    "One of the issues that was of significant concern to Sri Lanka and India in the early 1970s was the \u201cownership\u201d of the island of Katchativu since it was pivotal to the establishment of the maritime boundary between the two countries.\u00a0 This issue was resolved with the signing of the 1974 Agreement by the Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka and India and revised in 1976. However, since these Agreements are based on traditional practices of citizens in both countries and, therefore, had \u201cno legal resolution of ownership\u201d (MDD Peiris, November 24, 2024), at the operational level, adherence to the obligations in the Agreements are fluid. Consequently, the ceding of Katchativu by India to Sri Lanka as per the Agreements is considered by India to be an act of treachery; even Prime Minister Modi is of a similar view.",
    "As long as such perspectives persist at the highest level in India, attempting to resolve these contentious issues through dialogue is a futile exercise even if the highest level is committed to policies such as \u201cNeighbourhood First\u201d. Therefore, the only option for Sri Lanka and India, as members of the UN Charter, is to jointly or separately refer the matter to the ICJ for a legal resolution of all issues involved, if there is to any justice under the policy of \u201cNeighbourhood First\u201d, for it to mean what it states and not India First in the neighbourhood.",
    "According to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Article 56) the exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing living and non-living natural resources of a Coastal State within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a sovereign right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite this, thousands of trawlers from India enter Sri Lanka\u2019s EEZ and not only exploit its resources but also destroy marine resources by resorting to bottom trawling, evidence of which abound.",
    "In a United Nations-Nippon Foundation of Japan Fellowship Programme of 2016, Aruna Maheepala claims: \u201cThere are over 5,000 mechanised trawlers in Tamil Nadu and nearly 2,500 of them enter Sri Lankan waters on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays and often coming at 500 m of the shoreline (emphasis added) \u2026 More than 50,000 marine fishers live in the Northern fisheries districts (Jaffna, Kiliinochchi, Mannar, Mulative), which is around one fourth of the marine fishers of the country. Before the commencement of the war (1982) around 40% of the fish production of the country came from Northern fishery districts (except Killinochchi). However, the contribution of the fish production in the Northern fishery district drastically dropped to 5% in the peak period of the war (2008) and gradually increased after 2009. Furthermore, livelihoods of Sri Lankan fishers\u2019 have been drastically affected as a result of the Indian poaching\u201d.",
    "News 1st reported on 14 April 2021: \u201cIndian fishing vessels illegally fishing in Sri Lankan waters pillage around Rs, 900 billion worth of valuable marine resources in the Northern seas of Sri Lanka\u201d (Northern Province Fisheries Asso. Chief, M.V. Subramanium).",
    "\u201cAssessing reparation of environmental damage by the ICJ\u201d, (Questions on International Law, QIL) cites the case of compensation for environmental damage in Nicaragua/Costa Rica, the ICJ\u2019s Judgment was:",
    "\u201cTo shed light on the case, the Court sought support in international law and decisions of arbitral tribunals. In 1927, the ICJ already underlined in its judgment related to the Factory of Chorzo\u0301w that a breach involves an obligation to make a reparation \u2018in an adequate form\u2019. The Court recalled that it had in a previous judgment, in 2015, assigned sovereignty over the area to Costa Rica, and Nicaragua\u2019s activities were, therefore, in breach of that sovereignty. As such, the obligation for Nicaragua to make reparation was no longer to be disputed. Reparation in the form of compensation, as applied in the present case, was determined by the judgment in 2015.",
    "Before addressing the issue of compensation in itself, the Court deemed it appropriate to follow a two-fold approach. The Court first determined the existence and extent of the damage to environmental goods and services caused by Nicaragua\u2019s wrongful activities, and then went on to assess the existence of a direct and certain causal link between such damage and Nicaragua\u2019s activities. This section will successively examine the Court\u2019s analysis of the points of contention, its choice of method, and the assessment of the damage as established by the Court\u201d.",
    "A meeting was held in 1921, between the Colonial Governments of India and Ceylon \u201cin order to avoid over-exploitation of maritime resources and the possibility of competition between the fishermen of India and Sri Lanka in the same waters for their catch, the colonial Governments of Madras and Colombo agreed to delimit the waters in the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Bay. The two parties met in Colombo on October 24, 1921. The Indian team was led by Mr. C. W. E. Cotton and the team representing the government of Ceylon was headed by Hon. B. Horsburg\u201d.",
    "\u201cBoth parties accepted the principle of equidistant and the median line could be the guiding factor\u201d.\u00a0 However, since at Kachchathivu the principle of equidistant \u201cwould considerably narrow the area of operations for the Indian fishermen\u201d, the Ceylon delegation proposed a line that was three miles west of the island \u201cso that there would be an equitable apportionment in the fisheries domain for both Sri Lanka and India\u201d. The proposal by the Ceylon delegation was based on the fact that \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty over Kachchathivu was never in question, was beyond any doubt and was not a matter for negotiation.\u00a0 He (Hon. B. Horsburg) quoted from the correspondence that the Survey Department and the Department of Public Works in Colombo had exchanged with the counterparts in India, in which the sovereignty of Sri Lanka over Kachchativu had been taken for granted by the Indian authorities\u2026 After discussion the delimitation line was fixed three miles west of Kachchativu\u201d (Jayasinghe, p. 14,15).",
    "Agreement between the two parties is reflected in the letter from the head of the Indian delegation, C. W. E. Cotton, in which he states: \u201d \u2026 we unanimously decided that the delimitation of the new jurisdiction for fishing purposes could be decided independently of the question of territoriality.\u00a0 The delimitation line was accordingly fixed, with our concurrence three miles west of Kachchativu and the Ceylon representatives thereupon agreed to a more orderly alignment south of the island than they had originally proposed\u2026\u201d  (Ibid, p. 130).",
    "What is relevant from all of the above is that regardless of the basis for establishing a boundary under colonial rule, such boundaries morph into territorial boundaries of independent states under the \u201cDoctrine of UTI POSSIDETIS\u201d.",
    "Black\u2019s Law Dictionary has defined the legal Doctrine of \u201cUti possidetis juris\u201d as \u201cthe doctrine that old administrative boundaries will become international boundaries when a political subdivision achieves independence (Hansal & Allison, \u201cThe Colonial Legacy and Border Stability\u201d, p. 2; quoting Garner 1999).",
    "The principle behind this doctrine dates back to Roman times. The principle first emerged in the modern sense with the decolonization of Latin America when each former Spanish colony agreed to accept territories that were \u201cpresumed to be possessed by its colonial predecessors\u201d (Ibid). The same doctrine was accepted by former colonies in the African continent.\u00a0 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has \u201cargued for its relevance across the world\u201d (Ibid).",
    "\u201cThis principle was stated most directly in the ICJ\u2019s 1986 decision in the Frontier Dispute/Burkina Faso Republic of Mali case.\u00a0 The ICJ had been asked to settle the location of a disputed segment of the border between Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which had been part of French West Africa before independence. \u00a0In their judgment over the merits of this Frontier Dispute case the ICJ emphasized the legal principle of uti possidetis juris\u201d:",
    "\u201cThe ICJ judgment in the Mali-Burkina Faso Dispute case also argued that the principle of uti possidetis should apply in any decolonization situation regardless of the legal or political status of the entities on each side of the border\u201d:",
    "\u201cThe territorial boundaries which have to be respected may also derive from international frontiers which previously divided a colony of one State from a colony of another, or indeed a colonial territory from the territory of another independent State\u2026There is no doubt that the obligation to respect pre-existing international frontiers in the event of State succession derives from a general rule of international law, whether or not the rule is expressed in the formula of uti possidetis\u201d (ICJ 1986, Ibid).",
    "Based on the ICJ Judgment, the Maritime Boundary between India and Sri Lanka should be what existed during Colonial times and continue as the International Maritime Boundary when India and Sri Lanka gained independence. The fact that Sri Lanka failed to use the provision of Uti Possidetis has cost Sri Lanka\u2019s economy dearly and continues to do so in terms of treasure and human suffering.",
    "The issue of Indian fishermen fishing in Sri Lanka\u2019s territorial waters was resolved in 1921, when the Colonial Government of India and then Ceylon unanimously agreed on what the Maritime Boundary was to be. Accordingly, the island of Kachchativu was to be part of Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign territory as it had been before Ceylon was colonized.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following independence of both countries, the boundaries that were recognized while under colonial rule should have been recognised as the boundaries of independent India and Sri Lanka in keeping with the internationally recognized doctrine of UTI POSSIDETIS cited above.",
    "Instead of staking Sri Lanka\u2019s claim on the principle that colonial boundaries transform into international boundaries upon gaining independence, Sri Lanka opted to base their claim on traditional and historical practices and agreements were signed by the Prime Ministers of India and Sri Lanka.in 1974 and revised in 1976. The opportunity to stake Sri Lanka\u2019s claim on the basis of international law was lost, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with related legal provisions.",
    "While sovereign countries are free to forge agreements between themselves, their durability is dependent on varying personal political agendas of political actors in each country. Consequently, what is acceptable today may be unacceptable tomorrow.\u00a0 Since these agreements are not based on international law, Indian political leaders, such as Prime Minister Modi, refuse to accept them. These perspectives have emboldened Indian fishermen to violate Maritime Boundaries and destroy marine resources by resorting to bottom trawling. \u00a0Furthermore, the numerous discussions between the two governments have failed to resolve substantive issues and have resulted ONLY in the India government\u2019s focus being on the release of arrested Indian fishermen and their vessels.",
    "Therefore, since the issue of maritime boundaries has a direct bearing on illegal entry into Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign territory and destruction of marine resources, the ONLY durable way to resolve this contentious issue is to seek the assistance of the ICJ to rule on a legal determination as to the location of maritime boundaries based on the principle of UTI POSSIDETIS, on which depends claims for reparations for damages to maritime resources inflicted over decades. In this regard, Sri Lanka should be encouraged by the ICJ determination in the case of Nicaragua and Costa Rica in 2015 cited above.",
    "The opportunity presented by the forthcoming visit of President Dissanayake to India should NOT be missed by the new government because all previous governments and their advisors have failed to address this all-important issue, either because of their timidity or ignorance of relevant International Laws. If Dissanayake fails to inform India that Sri Lanka has no option but to seek the assistance of the ICJ to resolve the issue of maritime boundaries, Sri Lanka will have to accept the bitter prospect of the plunder of its resources and the sovereign rights of the People and the Nation forever.",
