  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka Test captain Dimuth Karunaratne does not believe that captaincy is a burden to him. This he reiterated after his team lost both the Test matches and thus the series against the visiting Pakistan team.",
    "Speaking exclusively to this reporter, he said, \"I don't think captaincy is a burden to me\".",
    "The captain scored 29 and 20 runs in the Galle Test and 17 and 41 runs in the 2nd Test at the SSC grounds which the home team lost by an innings and 222 runs.",
    "\"I don't think my performance is so bad. Winning and losing is part and parcel of the game\".",
    "The 35-year-old Dimuth, however, reiterated his desire to relinquish the captaincy. \"I had already expressed my desire to leave the captaincy and I concentrated on my batting. However, selectors persuaded me to continue. Selectors still insist that I continue, I will continue to lead the side but my wish is that a new captain be groomed now. It is better for the future of Sri Lanka cricket\".",
    "\"There are quite a few names that come to my mind to be the Test captain. Kusal Mendis is not in good form but Dhananjaya de Silva can be good captaincy material\".",
    "Brook falls short of century as Australia take charge of fifth Test",
    "The all-rounder is 4 years younger to the present captain and also has experience of playing 51 Test matches.",
    "Dimuth Karunaratne has also expressed his desire to play the World Cup in India. \"Yes, if selectors pick me for the white ball game, I am keen to participate in the World Cup\", he added.",
    "Dimuth was a member of the ODI team which won the qualifying round in Zimbabwe recently. (Bipin Dani)"
