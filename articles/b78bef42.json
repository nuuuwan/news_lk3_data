    "Sanath Jayasuriya, who was confirmed in the post of head coach of Sri Lankan national cricket team, vowed to lead with impartiality and a commitment to excellence, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the team and the country.",
    "He made these remarks during a press conference held earlier today (07) following his appointment.",
    "When asked about the benefits of appointing a local coach over a foreign one, Jayasuriya emphasized the advantage of stronger communication with the players.",
    "\u201cIt is easier to share ideas with the players. If they have shortcomings, there is no barrier in approaching me. That self-confidence is crucial. The players know the kind of cricket I have played and its value,\u201d Jayasuriya stated.",
    "\u201cWith the support of senior players, we can make significant progress. As a local coach, I don\u2019t play favorites. I want to field the best team. This is a big challenge, and there\u2019s a great responsibility that comes with it\u201d, Jayasuriya added."
