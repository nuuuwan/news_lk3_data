### Sri LankaтАЩs CEB restructure faces execution risk, BB+(lka) rating confirmed: Fitch

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs state-run Ceylon Electricity BoardтАЩs re-structuring faces execution risk, Fitch Ratings said, while confirming its тАШBB+(lka) rating on expected state support.

тАЬThe new Electricity Act includes provisions to unbundle CEBтАЩs generation, transmission and distribution into separate entities,тАЭ Fitch said.

тАЬWe believe the unbundling will improve CEBтАЩs efficiency and competitiveness. The utility is already preparing separate financials, maintains separate bank accounts and is in the process of allocating assets and liabilities for the three units.

тАЬHowever, we believe the restructuring faces execution risk and may be contingent on the outcome of Sri LankaтАЩs general election on 14 November.тАЭ

A deviation from cost reflective tariffs is risk to the CEBтАЩs balance sheet.

тАЬCEB has operated on a cost-reflective tariff mechanism since June 2023, which is revised quarterly to ensure operating costs are covered,тАЭ Fitch said.
