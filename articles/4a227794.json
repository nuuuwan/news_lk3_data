    "The Department of Meteorology has issued a Heat Index Advisory for tomorrow (Feb. 23) for several parts of the country including Gampaha and Colombo districts.",
    "The heat index, the temperature felt on the human body is expected to increase up to \u2018caution\u2019 level at some places in North-western and North-central provinces and Gampaha, Colombo, Hambantota and Trincomalee Districts, it said.",
    "The advisory states that under this level of temperature, fatigue is possible with prolonged exposure and activity while continuing activity could result in heat strokes.",
    "Accordingly, the general public is requested to stay hydrated, take breaks in the shade as often as possible and limit strenuous outdoor activities. People are also urged to wear lightweight and white or light-coloured clothing.",
    "The Heat Index Forecast is calculated by using relative humidity and maximum temperature and this is the condition that is felt on your body. This is not the forecast of maximum temperature. It is generated by the Department of Meteorology for the next day period and prepared by using global numerical weather prediction model data."
