She pointed out the interlinkages between food waste and plastic waste across the supply chain and stressed the importance of scaling alternatives to single-use plastics, particularly in food packaging.",
    "She further underlined that applying circular economy practices across the agri-food value chain can reduce losses, improve resource efficiency, and create new opportunities for SMEs. Her key message was that integrating food waste and plastic waste strategies under a circular economy framework\u2014through strong multi-stakeholder collaboration\u2014can accelerate progress on climate action, food security, and sustainable economic growth in Sri Lanka.",
