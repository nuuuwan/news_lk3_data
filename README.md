In Sri Lanka, a ban on single-use plastics has led to the promotion of biodegradable alternatives like bamboo spoons. These eco-friendly options, however, pose challenges due to lack of awareness among non-Tamil speakers about proper disposal methods. The issue highlights the importance of multilingual instructions to ensure environmental responsibility across all communities, reflecting Sri Lanka's constitutional commitment to language equality.

In Sri Lanka, a ban on single-use plastics has led to the promotion of biodegradable alternatives like bamboo spoons. These eco-friendly options are widely available in markets. However, confusion arises among non-Tamil speakers about how to properly dispose of these items, as instructions are primarily in Tamil and Sinhalese. This highlights a gap in ensuring language inclusivity, particularly for constitutional language rights, where all official communications should ideally be accessible in all national languages, including Tamil.

UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Reuters) - The United States will boycott a United Nations tribute on Thursday to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed earlier this month in a helicopter crash, a U.S. official said.

"We won't attend this event in any capacity," a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The U.S. boycott has not previously been reported.

Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment.

Raisi, a hardliner who had been seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed when his helicopter came down in poor weather in mountains near the Azerbaijan border on May 19.

### Do you use the power to recover the flower of the flower?-The Blessed Chancellor

*2024-05-30 15:24:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184879) · `ta`

A controversy erupted when Sri Lanka's TS. I Company featured a Tamil symbol in its product, sparking accusations of cultural appropriation and political bias. Activists argue this reflects the country's chauvinistic politics towards Tamils. The incident, including the use of the symbol at a school event and concerns over potential legal action, highlights deeper issues of ethnic tension and political manipulation. Calls for unity among Tamil nationalists and a focus on electoral strategies are emerging as responses to these incidents.

🟩

"It is openly rooted to the politics of the Tamils ​​by uniting the flower of the flower," said Sathivale, a social justice activist and a national organization for the release of political prisoners.

Sri Lanka's leading footwear company TS. The I Company has recently posted a flower in one of its products marketed. It shows how much of Sri Lanka's chauvinist political bourgeoisie occupies and is publicly caught by one of the political identities of the Tamils ​​to trample the politics of the Tamils ​​by trampling and trampling the flower.. This is strongly condemned and the Tamil -conscious patriots must reveal the appropriate lesson.
