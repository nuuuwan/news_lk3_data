ECONOMYNEXT – Over 17.1 million voters in Sri Lanka are eligible to cast their votes to elect a 225-member parliament in the November 14 polls amid the sovereign defaulted nation’s partially completed debt restructuring and unfinished economic reforms.

The NPP has shown signs of positioning itself as a reformist force, leveraging populist appeal and a Marxist-leaning platform focused on socio-economic equity and anti-corruption.

The NPP’s policy platform has resonated strongly with voter segments disillusioned by the economic crises and prior administrations, analysts say.

### Relieving Tired Eyes

*2024-11-13 23:37:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/relieving-tired-eyes/) · `en`

Steep two tea bags (black or green tea) in a mug of boiled water for 02 to 04 minutes and then remove the tea bags, and press out the excess water from the bags.

Let the tea bags cool slowly at room temperature or chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

Your cold brew might give you a refreshing jolt, but a caffeine fix for the skin can also help calm blotchiness or swelling.

Start by freezing some brewed coffee in an ice cube tray. Once the coffee ice is ready, spend a few minutes gently rubbing an ice cube: under your eyes, along your brows, across the bridge of your nose, and from the outer corners of your eyes to your temples

Place the slices over your closed eyes for about 15 minutes.

As an alternative, try cold spoons. They can help constrict blood vessels and reduce areas of under-eye darkness.

### Will the 2024 General elections redefine Sri Lanka’s political future?

*2024-11-13 23:31:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Will-the-2024-General-elections-redefine-Sri-Lanka-s-political-future/4-769215) · `en`

This election is expected to be a defining moment for Sri Lanka, with outcomes that could significantly impact its political and economic trajectory in the coming years – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The upcoming General elections in Sri Lanka are pivotal, given the country’s complex political and economic landscape. Several key factors are shaping expectations for the outcome.

First, economic challenges remain a critical concern. Sri Lanka’s economic recovery from a severe debt crisis and inflation surge has been slow, with many citizens still experiencing financial hardship. This context has led to frustration with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as many view its policies as ineffective in alleviating economic pressures. This dissatisfaction may boost Opposition parties like the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National People’s Power (NPP), who have gained traction with promises of economic reforms and anti-corruption measures.

### Trump’s triumph: American Revolution/counter-revolution and world order

*2024-11-13 23:21:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Trump-s-triumph-American-Revolution-counter-revolution-and-world-order/4-769213) · `en`

President Trump actually thought that Kamala Harris, a feminist progressive-liberal, was a “radical-leftist, Marxist, Socialist, Communist”.

The Trump administration and a Republican Senate are going to regard a JVP-NPP regime in the Indian Ocean headed by JVP leader Anura Dissanayake, pale-pink NPP frill, crony corporate décor and all, differently from the way a Democrat White House and Senate did.

The multidimensional triumph of Donald Trump is an outcome I hardly applaud, but as a political scientist and former diplomat, I cannot fail to note its magnitude, even epic character, and respect the political achievement.

Was it a counter-revolution or a revolution? Critics would argue the former; fans, the latter. It is like those two-dimensional pictures we had as postcards or key-tags when we were schoolkids. It all depends on which side you tilt it; which angle you view it from.

### Invest in education plans: Securing the future of the nation’s children

*2024-11-13 23:11:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/invest-in-education-plans-securing-the-future-of-the-nations-children/) · `en`

A strong educational foundation is one of the most powerful investments we can make in our children’s future. In 2023, data from the Department of Census and Statistics revealed that over 3.88 million children were enrolled across 9,103 government schools, while over 137,869 attended private institutions. These young learners, aged 6 to 18, represent the promise of our nation’s future, and supporting their educational journey is crucial for building a brighter and a more prosperous tomorrow.

The rising cost of education, whether locally or abroad makes early financial planning crucial. Limited access to state universities and the increasing trend of pursuing higher education overseas highlight the need for structured savings. Education insurance offers a solution that combines savings with financial protection, ensuring children’s education is uninterrupted, even in uncertain times.

### What we should learn from Nehru

Now after so many years we have to shamefully admit that in this age of religious ostentation, hypocrisy, superstition and orthodox thinking where priests of all faiths are gaining influence and getting political patronage for opinions, there is now a deep gap between the Nehruvian understanding of scientific approach and its practical application and implementation in the Indian context. It has come a long way. But Nehru is as relevant today as he was then.

While today there is a deluge of superstitious clerics and leaders everywhere in the country, about seventy years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had foresightly emphasised that, ‘Politics led me to economics and it was from that that I was inspired by science and knowledge to adopt a scientific approach to problems and life. Only science can solve the problem of hunger and poverty. Science is the only medium that can eradicate hunger and poverty.’

A system change will be meaningless unless governance participation is taken to the people in an effective, practical way not just during elections but in between them as well – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In a society that has inequality and inequity, with many having no recourse to hold politicians responsible for the promises made, except believing promises by another set of politicians at the next election and believing them, and many ending up without opportunities for their advancement due to the failings of politicians, life does not change for them except going further downhill

Government has no wealth, and when a politician promises to give you something for nothing, he must first confiscate that wealth from you -- either by direct taxes, or by the cruelly indirect tax of inflation

Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers

Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The NPP’s policy platform strongly emphasizes environmental sustainability and energy independence. The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPP’s policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. ​

This could affect investment in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and utilities, where state influence may increase to ensure alignment with public needs and national priorities​.

### EXPLAINER: Possible policy impacts on Sri Lanka’s banking sector after parliament polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Under Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government, Sri Lanka’s banking sector is likely to experience significant changes and challenges as it navigates policy shifts focused on economic redistribution, social reforms, and restructuring. Here are five potential impacts on the banking sector after the parliament polls, in which NPP is believed to have an edge:

The NPP has historically advocated for stronger state control over strategic economic sectors, including banking. Under Dissanayake, the sector may face increased regulation and scrutiny aimed at reducing perceived corruption, addressing financial mismanagement, and protecting consumer interests. This could lead to a more restrictive operational environment for banks, with potential impacts on profitability and compliance costs. ​
