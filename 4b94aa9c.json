    "The Attorney General has raised preliminary objections before the Court of Appeal requesting to dismiss the petition filed by Pastor Jerome Fernando, seeking a ruling to invalidate the order issued by Colombo Fort Magistrate to remand him in custody.",
    "Accordingly, the Court of Appeal announced that the decision pertaining to the relevant preliminary objections will be delivered on Wednesday (Dec. 20).",
    "The objections were raised by Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, when the petition was taken up before the court today (18).",
    "On December 01, the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court ordered that the accused who had stirred controversy over his controversial remarks on several religions to be remanded in custody, after he was produced before the court following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a few hours after he arrived at the CID premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day.",
    "He found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.",
    "Fernando then flew out to Singapore on 14 May, two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court banned his foreign travels.",
    "After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on November 29. He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.",
    "As per a court directive, the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island.",
    "On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned Pastor Jerome should record a statement with the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him."
