However, he noted that full profit margins are not applied to Auto Diesel and 92 Octane Petrol to maintain stable prices.

    "In addition to outlining pricing principles, Minister Wijesekera noted the calculation of US dollar rates, based on the average monthly rate of actual purchases during the respective month.
