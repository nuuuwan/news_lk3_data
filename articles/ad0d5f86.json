    "(Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Israeli airstrikes had killed two successors to Hezbollah\u2019s slain leader, as Israel expanded its ground offensive against the Iran-backed group with a fourth army division deployed into south Lebanon.",
    "Netanyahu spoke in a video released by his office hours after the deputy leader of Hezbollah, which is reeling after a spate of killings of senior commanders in Israeli airstrikes, left the door open to a negotiated ceasefire.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve degraded Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including (Hassan) Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah\u2019s replacement, and the replacement of the replacement,\u201d Netanyahu said, without naming the latter two.",
    "Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to succeed Nasrallah, had probably been \u201celiminated\u201d. It was not immediately clear whom Netanyahu meant by the \u201creplacement of the replacement\u201d.",
    "Later, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israel knew Safieddine was in Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters when fighter jets bombed it last week and Safieddine\u2019s status was \u201cbeing checked and when we know, we will inform the public.\u201d",
    "Safieddine has not been heard from publicly since that airstrike, part of an escalating Israeli offensive after a year of border clashes with Hezbollah. The group is the most formidably armed of Iran\u2019s proxy forces across the Middle East and has been acting in support of Palestinian militants fighting Israel in Gaza.",
    "\u201cToday, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years,\u201d Netanyahu said.",
    "Israel\u2019s military said on Tuesday that heavy air strikes against underground Hezbollah installations in southern Lebanon over the prior 24 hours killed at least 50 fighters including six sector commanders and regional officials.",
    "The heightened regional tensions kindled a year ago by Palestinian armed group Hamas\u2019 attack from Gaza on southern Israel have escalated in recent weeks to engulf Lebanon.",
    "On Oct. 1, Iran, sponsor of both Hezbollah and Hamas, fired missiles at Israel. On Tuesday, Iran warned Israel not to follow through on threats of retaliation.",
    "Its foreign minister said any attack on Iran\u2019s infrastructure would be avenged while a senior Iranian official told Gulf states it would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d and would draw a response if they allowed their airspace to be used against Iran.",
    "Western powers are seeking a diplomatic solution, fearing the conflict could roil the wider, oil-producing Middle East.",
    "The Pentagon on Tuesday announced that Gallant will not go ahead with a visit to Washington and a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Lloyd Austin, planned for Wednesday.",
    "In a televised speech from an undisclosed location, Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader Naim Qassem said he backed attempts to secure a truce.",
    "For the first time, the end of war in Gaza was not mentioned as a pre-condition to halting the combat in Lebanon. Qassem said Hezbollah backed moves by Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, to secure a halt to the fighting.",
    "Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment on Qassem\u2019s remarks. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a briefing in Washington that Hezbollah had \u201cchanged their tune and want a ceasefire\u201d because the group is \u201con the back foot and is getting battered\u201d on the battlefield.",
    "Qassem said Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities were intact despite \u201cpainful blows\u201d from Israel. \u201cDozens of cities are within range of the resistance\u2019s missiles. We assure you that our capabilities are fine.\u201d",
    "The Israeli military said it had sent the 146th Division into south Lebanon, the first reserve division to have been deployed over the border, and was extending ground operations against Hezbollah from southeast Lebanon into its southwest.",
    "A military spokesperson declined to say how many troops were in Lebanon at one time. But the military had previously announced that three other army divisions were operating there, meaning that thousands of soldiers were likely on Lebanese soil.",
    "The Israeli military announced on Oct. 1 that ground forces had entered Lebanon, initially with commando units that were then followed by regular armoured units and infantry units.",
    "Overnight, Israel again bombed Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs where Hezbollah is headquartered and said it had killed a figure responsible for budgeting and logistics, Suhail Hussein Husseini - the latest in a string of assassinations of some of Hezbollah\u2019s top officials.",
    "The Israeli military on Tuesday issued a new evacuation warning for residents, especially in specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has its headquarters.",
    "In northern Israel not far from the Lebanon border, warning sirens sounded regularly throughout Tuesday as authorities said Hezbollah fired almost 200 rockets into Israel.",
    "An Israeli military spokesperson said over 3,000 rockets had been fired into Israel from Lebanon so far in October, but interceptions by air defences had prevented many casualties and significant damage.",
    "Targets on Tuesday again included Haifa, the northern port city where there were multiple reports of damage to buildings from missile debris. Israel\u2019s military said it had struck the launchers that fired the missiles at Haifa.",
    "The mushrooming Israeli-Hezbollah conflict has killed well over 1,000 people in Lebanon in the past two weeks and prompted the mass flight of more than a million.",
    "Israel\u2019s stated objective is to make its northern areas safe from Hezbollah rocket fire and allow thousands of displaced residents to return."
