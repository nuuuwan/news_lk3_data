    "Sri Lanka actively engaged in the negotiation of the BBNJ Agreement since inception of discussions.",
    "As a developing country, Sri Lanka is proud to be part of this historic journey to internationally recognize equitable access to and protection of ocean resources for the benefit of humanity.
