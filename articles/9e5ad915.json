    "Many are those who are tut-tutting over the latest fuel price revision, which has not brought any relief to the general public; trishaw drivers, who served as the JVP-led NPP\u2019s grassroots propaganda foot soldiers, as it were, are prominent among them. Quite a few of them are openly critical of the NPP government.",
    "Securing popular mandates in elections is one thing, but delivering what they are obtained for is quite another. Sri Lankan voters are a fastidious lot known for their impatience to have election pledges fulfilled. So, it is only natural that the NPP government has come under fire for its inability to sort out a host of issues such as unconscionably high prices of commodities, especially rice, coconuts, milk food, eggs and fuel.",
    "The NPP leaders, who came to power, promising to break the back of the escalating cost of living immediately, are now expected to make good on their pledge. They also offered to slash petroleum prices by reducing taxes and eliminating corruption, but fuel prices were reduced only marginally last month. The latest fuel price revision has irked the ordinary people using regular petrol and diesel, whose prices have remained unchanged. Only the prices of 95 Octane petrol and Super Diesel have been brought down, and the government stands accused of having sought to serve the interests of the rich at the expense of the poor.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his interim government are caught in a nutcracker, in a manner of speaking. On the one hand, they have to abide by the IMF dictates to keep the bailout programme on track, and on the other, they are under severe pressure from the public as well as the Opposition to grant promised relief forthwith.",
    "The IMF has said in no uncertain terms that general government revenues must be in the region of 15 percent of GDP in 2025. So, it will be well-nigh impossible for the government to reduce taxes to slash fuel prices, and at the same time it cannot convince the public of this economic reality; they are in no mood to reason.",
    "The NPP says it will win the upcoming general election. If it achieves its dream, it is likely to find itself in a more unenviable situation, for it has pledged to grant pay hikes from Budget 2025 and increase welfare expenditure substantially; it has said it needs a parliamentary majority to deliver the promised relief. But whether it will be able to allocate adequate funds for that purpose within the fiscal confines stipulated by the IMF is the question.",
    "The IMF has urged Japan, an economic powerhouse, to fund additional spending plans for relief programmes within its budget without issuing more debt. This has been the IMF\u2019s reaction to the Japanese government\u2019s promise to introduce a sizeable spending package to mitigate the adverse impact of rising costs on the public. \u201cAny kind of support you are providing should be a lot more targeted, and any kind of new initiative should be financed within the budget \u2026 You should not be increasing more debt to provide for any new initiative,\u201d Krishna Srinivasan, IMF Director for Asia and Pacific has told Japan, according to Reuters. This shows how difficult it will be for the next government of Sri Lanka, dependent on IMF assistance, to increase welfare expenditure.",
    "Whenever a self-proclaimed messiah elevated to power fail in this country, those who have voted for him or her try to overcome their sense of guilt and vent their frustration by swinging en masse to another political camp, and when they react in this manner waves of popular support form in the polity and crafty politicians ride them. The NPP has benefited from such a wave, and, now, the biggest challenge before it is to prevent its political and electoral gains from being reversed by a counterwave of public anger.",
    "Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the SLPP also rode a massive wave of popular support to power in 2019, but faced a backlash soon afterwards. Most trishaw operators threw their weight behind Gotabaya in the 2019 presidential race, but when he became a metaphor for failure, after being ensconced in power, they dissociated themselves from him, and some of them went to the extent of displaying on their tuk-tuks a catchy slogan, which read in Sinhala, \u201cSajith peradichcha eka hondai, neththam api thama hithan inne Gota veddek kiyala\u201d\u2014\u2018it is good that Sajith lost [in the 2019 presidential contest], otherwise we would still have been under the impression that Gota was a maven\u2019. Whether the NPP, in case of its victory in the upcoming parliamentary race, will be able to prevent the aforesaid slogan reappearing on trishaws, with \u2018Gota\u2019 replaced with \u2018Anura\u2019, remains to be seen.",
