    "Imam-ul-Haq finished unbeaten on 50 as he marshalled Pakistan to a four-wicket win over Sri Lanka, and a 1-0 series lead.",
    "The equation for both teams at the start of the final day of the Test was simple \u2013 Pakistan, chasing a target of 131, required 83 more runs with Sri Lanka needing seven wickets for victory.",
    "Pakistan showed good intent as captain Babar Azam struck two boundaries off the very first over of the day, bowled by Ramesh Mendis.",
    "With two more boundaries over the next four overs, off the bat of Azam, Pakistan had plundered 30 runs in five overs, denying Sri Lanka the early inroads they were looking for.",
    "Prabath Jayasuriya finally made the breakthrough, when he trapped Azam leg before wicket in the next over, though only 53 more runs were required at that stage.",
    "First innings double centurion Saud Shakeel then struck six boundaries for a rapid 30, with Ul-Haq adding a six, as the visitors kept chipping away, with no sign of success for Sri Lanka.",
    "Mendis, who conceded 42 runs off his first 5.3 overs today, finally made a breakthrough when Shakeel edged behind, before taking a good low catch off the bowling of Jayasuriya, but it was too little far too late, with Salman Agha hammering the first ball he faced for a six to take Pakistan over the winning line.
