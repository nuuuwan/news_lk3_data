  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) yesterday condemned what it described as \u201canti-democratic\u201d private member\u2019s bills presented to Parliament by SLPP MP Jayantha Ketagoda to re-convene the dissolved Local Government Authorities (LGAs) without holding elections.",
    "TISL believes that this move would be a heavy blow to the people\u2019s sovereignty enshrined in the Constitution.",
    "In its statement TISL said Local Government Members are the grass-roots level public representatives. Regular elections are essential for the people\u2019s mandate to be reflected in the LGAs. In addition, this Amendment sets a bad precedent as it creates a risk of abusing the legal framework to prevent holding timely elections, including national elections. This can lead to the people losing faith in the entire democratic system in the country, with negative implications to the rule of law as well.",
    "\u201cTherefore, TISL emphasises that any attempt to pass this Amendment must be roundly defeated. TISL calls on all citizens to stand up for their voting rights, by opposing this move,\u201d the statement added."
