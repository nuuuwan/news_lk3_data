    "Bank of Ceylon (BOC) has announced an initiative aimed at improving the travel experience for Sri Lankans seeking medical treatment abroad. The introduction of the Multi-Currency Travel Card (MCTC) is designed to address the needs of those traveling to destinations like India, which has become a prominent hub for medical tourism due to its advanced yet cost-effective healthcare services.",
    "Medical tourism, which traditionally involved patients from less-developed countries traveling to more developed nations for specialized treatments, has evolved. Today, individuals from developed countries also travel to emerging economies for more affordable medical care. India, in particular, has emerged as a key destination due to its extensive medical infrastructure and competitive pricing.",
    "To support Sri Lankans making medical trips to India, BOC is offering a privilege card that provides several valuable benefits. The Multi-Currency Travel Card simplifies transactions by allowing users to manage multiple currencies on a single card, eliminating the need for handling various denominations. This card can hold up to USD 25,000 and supports five designated currencies, including US dollars, GBP, Japanese Yen, Euro, and Australian dollars.",
    "Cardholders will benefit from a range of features designed to enhance their travel experience.",
