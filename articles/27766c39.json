  "original_body_lines": [
    "Colombo Central Bus Terminal gets complete facelift for first time in 60 years, with Rs. 425 m;\u00a0expects project to be completed by April 2026",
    "Begins renovation of historic Maradana Railway Station as part of broader plan to upgrade 100 stations countrywide via PPP under Dream Destination initiative",
    "Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake reveals plans to set up 50 multimodal transport centres by 2029 with 15 of them expected next year",
    "The Government yesterday launched two landmark transport infrastructure projects; the full redevelopment of the Colombo Central Bus Terminal and the renovation of the historic Maradana Railway Station under the Clean Sri Lanka program and its broader policy vision of \u201cA Thriving Nation \u2013 A Beautiful Life.\u201d",
    "President Anura Kumara Disanayake presided over both events, unveiling commemorative plaques and inspecting the project sites. The initiatives highlight the Government\u2019s strategy to modernise key transport hubs, while balancing heritage conservation and future mobility needs. By investing in clean, safe and accessible transport, both projects aim to improve daily life for citizens, strengthen connectivity, and support tourism and economic competitiveness.",
    "The Colombo Central Bus Terminal is being completely redeveloped for the first time in 60 years, with an allocation of Rs. 425 million under the Clean Sri Lanka program.",
    "Slated to be completed in April 2026, ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, the terminal will be transformed into a modern facility equipped with all necessary amenities to meet the demands of urban commuters.",
    "The redevelopment is being carried out with direct labour support from the Sri Lanka Air Force, along with collaboration from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Ceylon Electricity Board (CMC), National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), Road Development Authority (RDA) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Several private organisations, including NIO Engineering, have also extended voluntary support.",
    "Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake stressed that public transport is central to economic growth, noting: \u201cNo country can achieve development without strengthening public transport. Providing safe, affordable and convenient services is vital for accelerating Sri Lanka\u2019s economic targets.\u201d",
    "He also said Government aims to establish at least 50 multimodal transport centres across the country by 2029, with 15 such centres are expected to be set up in Colombo by 2026.",
    "Rathnayake noted that the multimodal transport centres will be designed to provide bus, train and taxi services from one location, easing access for the commuters.",
    "In a parallel effort, under the Dream Destination initiative, the renovation of Maradana Railway Station was officially launched as part of a wider plan to upgrade 100 stations across the country through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Maradana, the second largest railway station in Colombo District, will undergo modernisation while preserving its historic architecture.",
    "The program seeks to create a sustainable, modern and standardised railway system, improving passenger safety, accessibility, and comfort, including facilities for persons with special needs.",
    "The Railway Department also introduced a new Sinhala computer font, \u201cRuhunu Kumari,\u201d during the launch.",
    "Minister Rathnayake said decades of neglect and outdated political practices had weakened the railway sector, but the new program, uniting unions, passengers, communities and the private sector would ensure an efficient service that restores public trust and boosts tourism."
