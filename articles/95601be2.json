    "Ananda Krishnan, one of Malaysia\u2019s most prominent billionaires, passed away peacefully on Thursday at the age of 86, according to a statement by Usaha Tegas Sdn Bhd, his private investment vehicle. The family has requested privacy during their time of mourning.",
    "\u201cHe has made significant contributions to nation-building and the corporate world,\u201d Usaha Tegas said. \u201cHis philanthropic initiatives have touched many lives.\u201d",
    "A Harvard Business School alumnus, Ananda founded several iconic Malaysian companies, including Maxis Bhd, Malaysia\u2019s second-largest mobile operator, and Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, a leading broadcasting and media firm. He also owned a substantial stake in oilfield services provider Bumi Armada Bhd.",
    "In April, Forbes ranked Ananda as Malaysia\u2019s third-richest person, with a net worth of $ 5.1 billion (RM 22.66 billion), trailing only Robert Kuok and Quek Leng Chan.",
    "Despite his immense wealth and influence, Ananda shied away from media attention throughout his life. He spent much of his time between Malaysia and France with his wife. Media reports suggest that his two daughters were not interested in taking over his businesses, while his only son is a Buddhist monk in Thailand.",
    "Ananda\u2019s rise to prominence was closely linked to the economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s, during which he became associated with former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. His portfolio extended beyond telecommunications to include ventures in oil and gas, solidifying his position as a corporate titan.",
    "Usaha Tegas described his passing as a great loss to the nation, highlighting the indelible mark he left on Malaysia\u2019s corporate and philanthropic landscape."
