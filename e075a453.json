Every subsequent year, the chosen child\u2019s academic performance is evaluated to ensure that those with good performance are supported through the course of their schooling. This year, children of 300 couriers were awarded free scholarships and learning tools. Two children with top academic performance and sports achievements were awarded a laptop and a sports goods voucher respectively. As a testimony to the success of the Uber Delivery Scholar program, over 85% of children chosen in the past, continued to perform well academically and have qualified for the next year.

We believe that school scholarships for children of couriers and customised diploma courses for merchant partners will bring them one step closer to achieving their life goals.\u201d",
