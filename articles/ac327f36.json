    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s new government under President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will proceed with the legal case on 2015 bond scam in which former leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and his close ally are being accused of being involved in the scam.",
    "A presidential commission of inquiry found that Arjuna Mahendran, handpicked for Central Bank Governor post in 2015 had interfered in a bond auction and has leaked inside information to help Perpetual Treasuries, owned by his son in law, to make billions of rupees in profits.",
    "Mahendran raised a policy rate floor outside the regular monetary policy meeting and pressured a tender board to sell bonds at high prices, the inquiry found.",
    "The inquiry also found that Perpetual Treasuries had paid central bank dealers, who were managing the country\u2019s largest pension fund, to buy bonds at high prices and other state funds.",
    "Despite the findings, the legal process could not proceed after Mahendran, a Singapore \\citizen, failed to appear before the courts after he left the country saying that he was going for a wedding.",
    "I think the wedding affairs should be over now. So we should be able to bring him back soon,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman Vijitha Herath said at the weekly cabinet media briefing on Tuesday (01).",
    "He said presidential immunity stated in the constitution has been considered for not calling Wickremesinghe to the courts.",
    "The immunity in the past had allowed past presidents not to be accountable for their wrong decisions or to appear in the courts in legal cases against them.",
    "\u201cRanil Wickremesinghe is also not the president now. So he does not have immunity. That legal case did not proceed because the immunity specified in the constitution was used. Now we have the power to bring him before the courts.\u201d (Colombo/October 01/2024)"
