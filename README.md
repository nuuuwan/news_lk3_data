E-Visa fraud investigation underway after Supreme Court ruling. Government resumes Foreign Federation, Parliamentarians challenge visa agreement citing lack of transparency. ETA process reinstated, private company handling replaced. Forensic audit ordered by Foreign Minister.

ЁЯЯй

Following the Supreme Court's decision, the government has resumed the Foreign Federation and has resumed the present visa application base.

Parliamentarians Rauf Hakeem, MA Sumanthiran and Patali Champika Ranawaka filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the president's visa agreement. They alleged that the contract was not openly issued and the federation had to earn up to $ 2.75 billion in the 16 -year period.

According to the criterion before April 17, Immigration Officers have now recovered the electronic travel authorization (ETA) process for issuing one-rolling visas, and the private federation, which has handled it, has avoided the IVS-GBS and VFS Global.

Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, who is responsible for the Department of Immigration and Emigration, has confirmed that forensic audit will be conducted on the incident.

It is time for us to face the reality that the dream of Tamil Eelam is over, and clinging to this idea will only hinder the progress and well-being of our people. Revisiting the painful final days of the war, debating who was involved, and speculating on alternative outcomes are not productive. They only serve to deepen wounds and create further division within our community and the nation as a whole. Instead, we must focus on the futureтАФone that promotes healing, unity, and cooperation.

Reliving these events in endless debates may feel like a way to process our loss, but in truth, it is a distraction. Our homelandтАЩs future depends on finding ways to move forward. The current political leadership (NPP), which itself has experienced defeat and decimation not once but twice, has managed to reconcile and secure the trust of the majority. They have shown that it is possible to rise above the bitterness of the past, and we must take a page from their book.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs private credit surged 135 billion rupees in August 2024, up from 60 billion rupees in July, with credit to government and state enterprises contracting amid better fiscal management, data shows.

Central Bank contracted 51 billion rupees to 1,754 billion rupees from 1,806 billion rupees as deflationary policy continued.

Commercial bank credit to state enterprise contracted 20.5 billion rupees. Credit to government from commercial banks contracted 42.6 billion rupees.

The central bank has so far refrained from denying monetary instability to businesses and people giving them a chance to struggle up from the last crisis it created, as it had done in the past by cutting rates claiming inflation was low.

After a currency crisis is triggered and the stabilization crisis that follows to prevent the domestic currency collapsing further, domestic demand collapses and cost of materials surge. As a result new projects are halted.

Before reflecting on the recently departed President Ranil Wickremesinghe, I would like to extend my congratulations to Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was newly appointed as the ninth President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Coming from a distant rural area and having embarked on a long and challenging political journey, he skilfully conducted his election campaign, achieving a remarkable victory.

Although he did not secure more than 50% of the vote, increasing his vote percentage from 4.3% in 2020 to 42% is a significant achievement. Clearly, this victory is the result of the extensive campaign launched against corruption and fraud. Therefore, this can be seen as a vote primarily against corruption, fraud, waste, elitism, and the establishment.

### IIHS opens global careers for Lankan youth in nursing

*2024-09-29 03:16:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/iihs-opens-global-careers-for-lankan-youth-in-nursing/) ┬╖ `en`

Sri Lanka is at a pivotal point, experiencing a demographic transition that presents unique opportunities for economic and social growth. With a large portion of the population in the 15-29 age group, there is an urgent need to provide sustainable employment solutions for the countryтАЩs youth, particularly those in rural areas. Amidst challenges like unemployment, poverty, and limited access to skills development, the healthcare sector emerges as a promising avenue for empowering the youth. Nursing, in particular, offers a significant solution to the youth unemployment crisis. The global demand for nursing professionals is growing rapidly, driven by an aging population and the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries are facing shortages in healthcare professionals, making nursing one of the most secure and sought-after professions worldwide. Sri Lanka, with its high literacy rate and skilled youth population, is well-positioned to meet this global demand.

The first half of 1973 saw two important events, the visit of the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi in April. and on May 17 the opening of The Bandaranalke Memorial International Conference Hall. During Mrs. GandhiтАЩs visit, the two Prime Ministers had set apart some time for one-on-one discussion, without any Ministers or officials being present.

### Going Native at Tambuttegama- a Dry Zone Purana Village

*2024-09-29 02:02:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/going-native-at-tambuttegama-a-dry-zone-purana-village/) ┬╖ `en`

Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, Sri LankaтАЩs new president, grew up in Tambuttegama, a Purana (old, traditional) village in the Anuradhapura District. I did extensive fieldwork for my doctoral thesis in this village over 10 months in 1978/79. At that time, I guess, the president was a young boy attending Tambuttegama Maha Vidyalaya. As I had visited practically every family in the village, I might have visited his family during my stay there.

### Sir John Kotelawela (1953 тАФ 1956), as seen by his Assistant Secretary

The strongest man is never strong enough to be always master, unless lie transforms his power into right, and obedience to duty.

At the time my story begins, a routine civil service transfer had me moved as Assistant Secretary in the prime ministerтАЩs office which was without doubt the most exalted and powerful institution in Sri Lanka. For the first 30 years of the new stateтАЩs existence, its place in the political structure remained unchallenged and unchanged. The role of the prime minister as the keystone of the arch in a Westminster-style government was paramount. It was only much later, after the second Republican Constitution in 1978 and the creation of the Executive Presidency with its enormous concentration of power, that the position of the prime minister became as it now is, devoid of constitutional authority, largely decorativeтАЩ and what its holder is able to make of it.

In 1978, the government of J. R. Jayewardene enacted a new Constitution which transformed the office of the Prime Minister into that of an all-powerful, almost omniscient Executive President who was both head of state and head of government. The then Prime MinisterтАЩs rationale was that the parliamentary system which had prevailed until then had become a hindrance and that the country required a new political arrangement which would shield its leaders from the vagaries of parliamentary politics.

### Sri Lanka Provides Hope for Democracy in the West

*2024-09-29 01:42:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-provides-hope-for-democracy-in-the-west/) ┬╖ `en`

Sri LankaтАЩs Presidential election saw a genuine left-winger, from a Marxist party, record a victory that upended the countryтАЩs political establishment. But the NPPтАЩs win was more than just historic for this country. A man whose ideology with regard to the fundamental questions of policy differs from all predecessors was elected. This is something presently unimaginable in the West. While it may have been different 100 years ago, today in most major Western countries, there is increasingly no way for the public to vote away the two sacred cows of the establishment: neoliberal capitalism and neo-con foreign policy. Here, Sri Lanka can provide hope.

In this second part of my interview with Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka (part one appeared last week) we ventured into the philosophical underpinnings of contemporary geopolitics. Dr. Jayatilleka contends that the war in Ukraine represents a critical inflection point, suggesting that the West may soon confront a more profound reality: Vladimir Putin is merely a symptom of a deeper, more complex Russian psyche. This perspective challenges the prevailing discourse and calls for a reconsideration of how power, fear, and resistance are constructed on the global stage. We also explored IndiaтАЩs nuanced role within its regional dynamics, the enduring struggles in Palestine, the evolving tensions in West Asia, NATOтАЩs expansion, and the relentless rise of China.
