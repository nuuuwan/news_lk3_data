    "The fifth man on board, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, was a 77-year-old former French navy diver and renowned explorer.",
    "At a news conference on Thursday, Rear Adm John Mauger of the US Coast Guard said that the debris is believed to be consistent with the Titan submersible.",

    "Other personnel - including medical experts and technicians - will begin demobilising.",

    "The Coast Guard now believes there was no connection between the noises and the location in which the Titan\u2019s debris was found on the sea floor."
