    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Walasmulla Magistrate\u2019s Court has granted permission for authorities to detain and interrogate Sampath Manamperi, a former Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Pradeshiya Sabha candidate, for 90 days in connection with a major narcotics-related investigation.The detention order was issued following a request by the Western Province (North) Crimes Division, which informed the court that Acting Defence Minister Aruna Jayasekera had authorized the extended detention under relevant legal provisions.Manamperi was arrested after police discovered two containers of chemicals on his property in Middeniya, suspected to be used in the production of crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as \u2018ICE\u2019).\u00a0The case was taken up during proceedings at the Walasmulla Magistrate\u2019s Court.The first suspect in the case, Piyal Manamperi, has already been remanded until October 8."
