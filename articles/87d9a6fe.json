    "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and seven others were yesterday further remanded until 3 June by the Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "They are facing charges related to the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.",
    "This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 2 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.",
    "The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.",
    "Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail.",
    "As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Meanwhile, one of the suspects who was arrested and remanded in connection with the case was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on 6 May.",
    "Accordingly, the former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana had been released on bail."
