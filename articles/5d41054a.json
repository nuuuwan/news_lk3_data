    "Jayasekara had filed the complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the party\u2019s General Secretary and a letter directed by the party\u2019s then chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself.",
