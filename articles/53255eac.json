    "Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror) - Following the approval of concessionary vehicle permits, the MPs across the political divide have asked for the extension of their one -million rupee insurance coverage to include their family members, a top source said yesterday.",
    "At the House Committee meeting held last Friday, the MPs have asked for this benefit while insisting for concessionary vehicle permits for the second time.",
    "Currently, the premium for the MPs\u2019 insurance is paid by them and the Parliamentary Affairs Ministry together. They have sought to include their family members in the coverage. They have reportedly agreed to pay an increased premium.",
    "However, the final decision has not yet been taken in this regard.",
    "Also, the source said the MPs insisted on the vehicle permits once again despite approval given at the previous meeting. Daily Mirror reportedly learns that Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane has written to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to consider granting such permits as requested by the MPs in writing.",
    "The government is to consider such concessions once the ban on vehicle imports are lifted."
