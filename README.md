### AKD and JVP-NPPтАЩs mega-mandate: Re-founding the nation

There were two classic works on Sri Lanka after 1956. тАЬCeylon: Dilemmas of a New NationтАЭ (Princeton 1960) by Howard Wriggins (he acknowledges with thanks the input of Mervyn de Silva--aged 30 at the time) and тАЬThe Emerging Elite: A Study of Political Leadership in CeylonтАЭ by Marshall Singer (MIT, 1964).

Political theory holds that the тАШcirculation of elitesтАЩ is imperative for the health of the body politic and society. The composition of the President Anura DissanayakeтАЩs new JVP-NPP Cabinet, as that of the new Parliament, signals that a new elite has emerged and acceded to power and rulership. It faces the old dilemmas.

Over a decade, Sri LankaтАЩs politics has displayed extreme electoral volatility manifested in swings of increasing amplitude. These began with 2015 when the voters swung against the Rajapaksa regime and elected the liberal-reformist Yahapalanaya (тАШGood GovernanceтАЩ) government of Maithripala Sirisena as President and Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM.

### Sri LankaтАЩs Arugam Bay Challenge

*2024-11-20 19:59:16* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lankas-arugam-bay-challenge/) ┬╖ `en`

Tisaranee GunasekaraтАЩs usually excellent writings are informed by a strong moral compass. In her recent examination of the Arugam Bay controversy (Daily FT, 6 Nov. 2024), however, that compass wobbles to the point of fracture.

Some preliminaries. Her account of the often gruesome atrocities meted out by the Israeli IDF to civilians in Gaza, and now Lebanon, is both accurate and sobering. And in this context itтАЩs also good to see that she highlights opposition to the Israeli war both from within Israel itself, the Jewish American community тАУ and, as she could have added, global Jewry. Thus, opposition to the war is not the issue in focus here. Rather, the key questions raised by her article relate solidly to Sri Lanka-directed realities and concerns.

Palestinians are тАЬfacing diminishing conditions for survivalтАЭ in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days, the UN has warned.

The UN said all its attempts to support the estimated 65,000 to 75,000 people in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabalia this month had been denied or impeded, forcing bakeries and kitchens to shut down.

Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza.

The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals.

Hundreds of people have been killed and between 100,000 and 130,000 others have been displaced to Gaza City, where the UN has said essential resources like shelter, water and healthcare are severely limited.

### Sri Lanka to import 70,000 tonnes of rice to address shortage: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka will import 70,000 metric tonnes of rice to address a shortfall in the market, Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Wasantha Samarasinghe said.

тАЬEven though there was a surplus rice production in the country this year, when you go to the market there is no rice,тАЭ Samarasinghe told reporters.

тАЬThe best decision we can take in this situation is to import rice to meet the demand.тАЭ

The rice will be imported by two state agencies, Sathosa and the State Trading Corporation Samarasinghe said.

Sri Lanka ran out short of parboiled rice (nadu) amid price controls which kept it at the same price as red rice, discouraging growing the variety according to demand, analysts say.
