    "The internal crisis within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) showed no signs of abating, as party member MP Duminda Dissanayake filed a petition with the Colombo District Court yesterday. Dissanayake is seeking an injunction order to prevent newly appointed SLFP Chairperson Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from carrying out his duties in the role.",
    "The move comes after the Kaduwela District Court on Monday issued an enjoining order prohibiting any individual or group from obstructing Rajapakshe and Acting Secretary, Keerthi Udawatta, from performing their duties within the party.",
    "Judge Dulani Wickramasooriya of the Kaduwela District Court issued these enjoining orders during a case brought forward by SLFP Executive Committee members Isuru Abeywardena and Sumith Wijayamuni de Soysa, who named 20 Executive Committee members as respondents.",
    "The SLFP\u2019s pro-Sirisena faction appointed Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as Chairperson at a special SLFP Executive Committee meeting held in Kotte over the weekend.",
    "However, the pro-CBK faction including party office bearers Duminda Dissanayake, Mahinda Amaraweera and Lasantha Alagiyawanna have refused to accept the appointment."
