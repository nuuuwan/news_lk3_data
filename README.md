Australia said on Tuesday it expected gold to become its second most valuable resource export after iron ore this financial year, dislodging liquefied natural gas, as concerns over geopolitical instability fuel demand for the safe-haven metal.

Australia’s gold exports are expected to rise by A$12 billion ($7.9 billion) to A$60 billion in the current financial year ending in June 2026, as the country exports more gold at higher prices, the department of industry said in its September quarterly report.

That would eclipse Australia’s export earnings for LNG, which are expected to fall to A$54 billion this financial year, and to A$48 billion the following year, tracking lower oil prices.

A lower interest rate environment in the United States is also expected to support gold prices above $3,200 a troy ounce over the next two years, the report said. Gold prices hit a record high on Monday and are trading close to $4,000 an ounce.

### US government shutdown enters second week after funding measures fail again in Senate

The US government shutdown entered its second week on Monday (Oct 6), with no sign of a deal between President Donald Trump’s Republicans and Democrats to end the crisis.

Democrats are refusing to provide the handful of votes the ruling Republicans need to reopen federal departments, unless an agreement is reached on extending expiring “Obamacare” healthcare subsidies and reversing some cuts to health programmes passed as part of Trump’s signature “One Big Beautiful Bill”.

With the government out of money since Wednesday and grinding to a halt, Senate Democrats looked set to vote against a House-passed temporary funding bill for a fifth time.

The hard line taken by Democrats marks a rare moment of leverage for the opposition party in a period when Trump and his ultra-loyal Republicans control every branch of government and Trump himself is accused of seeking to amass authoritarian-like powers.

### Why is it that Wijeweera's family is unable to provide security to Mahinda? - Ajith P Perera Question

*2025-10-07 04:27:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/227065) · `ta`

The security of his family has been confirmed by all governments to date after Rohana Wijeweera died. It is essential to ensure the safety of national citizens in any government. United People's Power MP Ajith P. Perera said the government should take steps to provide security to Mahinda Rajapaksa if the family of Rohana Wijeweera is provided with security.

He made this statement at a press conference held in Colombo on Monday (6). As he further stated,

Everyone should follow the Act to remove privileges for the President. But as a citizen of the country, he cannot eliminate his right to Mahinda Rajapaksa's security. The former president's pension and privileges are eliminated, but his security cannot be recognized.

The last governments, the current government and the future governments are responsible for ensuring his safety on the basis of being a leadership to complete the war.. Therefore, the removal of his security for political revenge is a false role.

### Outdated laws obstacle to resolving drugs shortages, says Health Minister

Health and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said that several long-standing laws and regulations are obstructing efforts to address the ongoing shortage of medicines in the country.

He noted that while some question why the Government cannot amend these laws despite having a Parliamentary majority, many of the regulations in question are not new but inherited from the British colonial period.

Speaking at the opening of the Vipassi Buddhist Centre at the Colombo National Hospital, Dr. Jayatissa stressed that legal reforms in the health sector must be approached carefully, as existing rules are interlinked and cannot be amended in isolation.

Alston, they say, will represent the Commonwealth Union and promote its objectives in line with the People’s Charter of the Commonwealth, focusing on strengthening regional collaboration, advancing the Commonwealth Union’s mission of inclusivity and sustainability, and fostering greater engagement with communities across Australia and the Pacific.

Alongside his Envoy responsibilities, the singer, I’m told, will also serve as a Consultant to the Commonwealth Union, providing advisory services and acting as a marketing consultant to enhance the Union’s outreach and global presence.
