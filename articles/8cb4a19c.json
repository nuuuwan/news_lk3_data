  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) announced that the Sapugaskanda refinery is to go for a planned shutdown for a statutory major turnaround after three years of operations.",
    "While issuing a public notice they said the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery will cease operations for 45 days in early July 2024, more than three years since the previous turnaround in February 2021.",
    "This is a mandatory requirement, in compliance with international norms, that qualifies the refinery for safe and reliable operations for a further three years.",
    "Once the refinery is brought back on stream after the turnaround, it will be subjected to upgrades designed to increase its contribution to Sri Lanka's changing product requirements.",
    "During the scheduled shutdown, the CPC will maintain a full capacity of crude to regain full throughput in the shortest possible time, along with a buffer stock of products for approximately twice the planned shutdown period to ensure continuous supply to customers."
