    "Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairperson D.J.A.S. Rajakaruna has sent a Letter of Demand (LoD) seeking Rs. 500 million in compensation from Ananda Palitha, the Convenor of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) aligned United Trade Union Alliance (UTUA), for what he has claimed to be deliberate and false propaganda against him.",
    "The LoD, sent by Counsel Sampath Yalewatte on 24 December 2024, has accused Palitha of making malicious and defamatory statements on 13 December 2024 against Rajakaruna. These statements, according to the letter, were broadcast widely across mainstream electronic media, print newspapers, television news, and social media platforms, resulting in reputational damage to the CPC Chairperson.",
    "The letter outlines at least eight false claims allegedly made by Palitha, including accusations that Rajakaruna receives double the salary of the previous CPC Chairperson, benefits from two Board of Directors\u2019 allowances under the same corporation, and engages in wasteful expenditure.",
    "Chairperson Rajakaruna\u2019s lawyers have asserted that these statements have caused significant damage to his reputation, leading to humiliation, slander, embarrassment, and ridicule in his capacity as CPC Chairperson.",
    "The LoD stipulates that compensation of Rs. 500 million must be paid within 14 days of 24 December 2024 and if the payment is not made within this timeframe, legal action will be initiated against Palitha."
