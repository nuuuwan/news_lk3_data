Potential to create 800,000 plus local jobs, and accelerate gender equality achievements

From households to national economies, care work ‚Äì both paid and unpaid ‚Äì keeps the world and the economy moving!

Often framed as an act of love, a noble calling, a not so important sector, care work is frequently under-valued, unrecognised, not perceived as work nor economic activity. COVID-19 brought into sharp focus the crucial roles of caregivers and care workers, creating the momentum for the first UN International Day of Care and Support, observed on 29 October 2023. Unpaid household care workers and paid care workers in domestic work or in the care and health sector, are vital pillars of our societies and economies, yet these contributions are often dismissed.

Care Work = Women‚Äôs Work: Why does the world see it as such?

The way we talk about suicide plays a vital role, as it has the potential to wound or heal, disenfranchise or empower, defeat or motivate, especially for survivors of loss

The 10th of September (World Suicide Prevention Day) and the hive of activity that surrounds it each year, has gradually begun to fade; from social media, and from our collective memory. However, there are still red-hot smouldering embers, brightly ablaze in the lives of those affected by mental illness and suicide, including those bereaved by suicide loss.

Prevention in the context of recognising warning signs and risk factors, reducing access to means and reaching out for support, helpline numbers, asking the suicide question, etc. in connection with intervention were widely discussed; in panel discussions, news articles, and social media platforms. However, a key concept discussed in the literature about suicide prevention was/is neglected; and that is postvention.

Spa Ceylon: Blending ancient ayurveda with modern luxury, captivating global markets

Showcasing Sri Lanka‚Äôs iconic destinations: A testament to the nation‚Äôs potential as a premier tourist hub, ready to captivate the world

In brief, international marketing is the process of planning and conducting transactions across national borders to create exchanges that satisfy the objectives of individuals and organisations.

It comes in forms of export/import trade to licensing, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries, turnkey operations, and management contracts.

With the prevailing economic crisis in Sri Lanka and depreciation of the rupee, the only way to address this issue is to increase exports. Sri Lanka exports amounted to Rs. 4,234,913 in 2022 according to Central Bank of Sri Lanka statistics.

Are we doing it right? Is this our potential? Is international marketing done in a proper way when it comes to branding Sri Lanka and its products and services to the world?

The Sri Lankan apparel sector has faced many challenges in recent years. Beyond the well-documented local challenges, the industry has also had to grapple with challenges originating from afar such as COVID-19 and the resultant economic uncertainties in the subsequent years and the geopolitical tensions which have added to the complexities surrounding global maritime logistics which have a direct impact on Sri Lanka‚Äôs favourability as a production location. As international demand waned, many manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized businesses, were forced to reduce operations.

A sustainable debt strategy rooted in transparency and collaboration with international stakeholders is essential to restore economic confidence and secure a brighter future for Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt burden has been a persistent challenge, driving the country into numerous fiscal crises over the past few decades, including the 2022 crisis that brought the country to bankruptcy. The country‚Äôs high levels of external and domestic debt have been exacerbated by political mismanagement, economic shocks, COVID pandemic, and global financial pressures. The recent crisis underscores the need for a comprehensive debt sustainability strategy, particularly with a new President in place. Several key options could help Sri Lanka better manage its debt, support long-term economic stability, reduce money printing and regain investor confidence to attract top FDI.

The stock market yesterday too continued on its bullish trend indicating that banking and financial sector counters are performing well. This is so because after the external debt restructuring process is concluded in November, the government could issue new sovereign bonds, replacing the previous/existing default bonds, thereby benefiting the local banking sector, market analysts said.

Following the conclusion of the external debt restructuring process in November, the local banking and financial sector is likely to get better options than other foreign banks in the sovereign bond issue exercise, thus resulting in attracting both, local and foreign investors, to those stocks, analysts said.

Amid those developments both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 135.5 points, while the S and P SL20 rose by 68.8 points. Turnover stood at Rs 3.96 billion with seven crossings.

We have failed to utilize our potential ‚Äì be it in climate, human resources or other ‚Äúdevelopment criteria‚Äù. This clearly needs to change. Perhaps, we are not the cat‚Äôs whiskers, nor certainly are we everybody‚Äôs chronic ‚Äúdog‚Äôs body‚Äù.

The 25th death anniversary of Plantation Tamil Patriarch Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman is being commemorated today 30 October 2024. Saumiyamoorthy (name is spelled as Savimiyamoorthy and  Saumiamurthy also) Thondaman who passed away on 30 October 1999, was the undisputed leader of Sri Lanka‚Äôs predominantly Indian Tamil plantation proletariat. As a journalist,  I have had the good fortune of interacting with him closely for several years. He was a leader whom I liked, admired and respected.

In my opinion, Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman was the shrewdest tactician and masterful strategist among Tamil political leaders in recent times. He was a pragmatic realist who grasped in essence that politics is the art of the possible. Applying Chanakyan methods in a practical sense, this larger than life leader of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Tamils of recent Indian origin ‚Äì known as ‚ÄúIndian Tamils‚Äù ‚Äì helped usher in a period of political empowerment and renaissance to his community.
