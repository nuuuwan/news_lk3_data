### HOW NOT TO RUN AN ELECTION (1956)

*2024-06-16 11:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/how-not-to-run-an-election-1956/) · `en`

As a Returning Officer, I played only second fiddle to the Government Agent, who was actually in charge of the Parliamentary Elections at the district level. However I was given definite duties: first, for staffing the polling booths with government staff officers; second, for supervising the actual process of elections in the polling booths; and third, for counting the ballots once the voting was done.

My first job was difficult because many Sinhalese officers in those days were reluctant to come so far to a Tamil-speaking district. This was long before the Tigers became the major political or military force in those districts. I was able to overcome this difficulty because some of my Sinhalese friends shared my interest in jungles and lagoons, and they were eager to come as polling officers to the Eastern Province. I had to officially get them to staff the polling booths; but unofficially, I had also to look after them and provide social activities for them.

### On demeaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake

*2024-06-16 11:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/on-demeaning-anura-kumara-dissanayake/) · `en`

In Sri Lanka, Tamil politics took a dramatic turn this week when Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited members of the Tamil National Alliance. According to media reports, Premadasa has promised to implement the 13th Amendment, while Dissanayake has vowed to revisit issues like devolution and power sharing.

This is not as shocking a development as one may assume; far more shocking developments have taken place in Sri Lankan politics. Nor should it surprise anyone it is taking place months before a presidential election, arguably the most crucial in recent years, is to be held.

Both Premadasa and Dissanayake are veteran political stalwarts; both have been in active politics since the early 2000s. There is something cynical about the whole matter, but perhaps what is most cynical is that the TNA itself has accepted these visits and engaged with these delegations.

“There is a political underworld operating in this country in addition to the goon-run social underworld we are all aware of. This political underworld thrives on its nexus with drug cartels. It must be eliminated without further delay; otherwise, we will all suffer under a narco-state,” Ranawaka said during an interview with the Sunday Island on Thursday.

He said that there were around 100,000 ex-servicemen with arms training now in society facing financial problems. “There are also 10,000 to 15,000 ex-LTTE cadres. They could be lured easily into criminal activity because of their financial problems.

🟩

A minority party leader has said that the efforts of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa have been completely broken.

He was participating in the negotiations on the merger effort and said he did not want to completely identify himself.

UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and United People's Power Leader Sajith Premadasa were carried out among the main members of the two sides.

Similarly, during the negotiations, the two sides were addressed on the concessions and future plans to be carried out.

However, the leadership representing the two sides had to face the crisis in continuing talks as they were not prepared for compromises. This has resulted in a continuing effort to achieve compliance, causing the leadership of the leaders to continue the issue.. This has resulted in complexity of such talks.

Therefore, it is useless to continue the negotiations. So that effort is now abandoned. ”

(Excerpted from Simply Nahil, a biography of business leader and philanthropist Nahil Wijesuriya described on the book cover as a “Maverick with the Midas touch)

During the period 1964-1967, in Nahil’s third year at Walkers (as a special apprentice), he firmly believed the Walkers engineering qualification was world-class, with the bonus of working in engineering workshops and going on board ships, which he enjoyed.

This was much-needed exposure for him personally since part of the training was ‘onboard’ ship work which was very interesting. The apprentice used this opportunity to do a little bit of side business –buying cigarettes and scotch from the sailors on board at duty-free prices and selling them outside, which was a regular thing.

A video of the catapult in action was posted on social media on Wednesday. CNN could not verify when the footage was filmed but geolocated it to the Israeli-Lebanese border.
