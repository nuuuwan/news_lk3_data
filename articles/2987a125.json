    "Ceylon Energy, in partnership with HJT China, proudly announces the successful completion of the Maho and Ampara 33kV power distribution lines. These milestones mark a significant achievement within the broader Supporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project (SESRIP), a groundbreaking initiative designed to revolutionise energy distribution across Sri Lanka.",
    "The SESRIP is a transformative electrification project, addressing the energy needs of some of Sri Lanka\u2019s most underserved regions. Covering an expansive 2,372 kilometres of low-voltage line extensions and incorporating 106 rural electrification schemes, the project represents a vital step toward ensuring reliable energy access across the nation. With a total length exceeding 270 kilometres and 13 33kV switching gantries, the SESRIP is set to provide dependable electricity to over 35,000 households, including those in the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces, as well as the Uva and North Central provinces, where electrification levels lag behind the rest of the country.",
    "At the core of the SESRIP\u2019s mission is the enhancement of the medium-voltage network, which will significantly improve the quality and reliability of electricity supply to more than 493,000 consumers. This initiative is not just about expanding infrastructure; it is about fostering inclusivity, ensuring that all Sri Lankans, regardless of their location, have access to stable and reliable energy. Moreover, the SESRIP aims to integrate renewable energy sources from various locations into the national grid, thereby reducing distribution power losses and contributing to the nation\u2019s sustainability goals.",
    "The SESRIP is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with a total investment of $ 42 million. Ceylon Energy and HJT China have been instrumental in bringing this ambitious project to life, showcasing their commitment to driving positive change and sustainable development across Sri Lanka.",
    "One of the key components of the SESRIP is the Maho power distribution line, which extends from Maho to Maeliya, covering a distance of 25 kilometres. This line, supported by 105 towering steel structures, carries electricity at 33kV. But this power line is more than just an infrastructure achievement \u2013 it is a lifeline for the communities it serves. With reliable energy now flowing through this network, local businesses, schools, and households can operate with newfound efficiency and stability.",
    "In the Eastern Province, another SESRIP milestone has been achieved with the completion of the Ampara power distribution line. Spanning 12 kilometres from Ampara to Uhana, this line is supported by 56 steel towers and, like its counterpart in Maho, carries electricity at 33kV. The completion of the Ampara line is a significant victory for the region, as it will uplift the livelihoods of countless families and industries.",
    "Reflecting on the completion of these power lines, Ceylon Energy Chairman Madushanka Fernando remarked: \u201cThis is a new beginning of a brighter era.\u201d His words encapsulate the spirit of resilience and commitment that has defined this project from the start. Despite facing numerous challenges, the stakeholders involved in the SESRIP have worked tirelessly to bring this vision to fruition. Their dedication has been the driving force behind the project\u2019s success, ensuring that the communities served by the Maho and Ampara power distribution lines will benefit for generations to come.",
    "As Ceylon Energy and HJT China continue their work on the SESRIP, the future of Sri Lanka\u2019s energy landscape looks brighter than ever. The completion of the Maho and Ampara power distribution lines is just the beginning, as the project continues to advance towards its goal of delivering reliable, sustainable, and inclusive energy to all Sri Lankans. This milestone is a testament to what can be achieved when innovation, partnership, and a commitment to progress come together. For the people of Sri Lanka, especially those in rural and underserved areas, the completion of these power lines signals a new era of opportunity and development."
