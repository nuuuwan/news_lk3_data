    "Unilever Sri Lanka recently inaugurated a new 2.33 MW solar power project at its Horana factory, partnering with Abans Electricals PLC for project execution. This significant step forward in Unilever\u2019s commitment to sustainability and renewable energy represents a total investment of 1.3 million Euros. The project aligns with Unilever\u2019s Global Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) and contributes to the ambitious goals set by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Electricity and Energy for transitioning the country\u2019s electricity supply to renewable sources by 2030.",
    "Ali Tariq, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Sri Lanka said \u201cWe are proud to inaugurate this solar power project, yet another investment to protecting our environment through sustainable practices. It is not just about manufacturing quality products and brands. We also ensure that we act as responsible corporate citizens in everything we do, aligning with our global vision of making sustainable living commonplace. The investment will produce 30%-35% of our Horana factory\u2019s energy requirement.",
    "The project is expected to reduce Unilever\u2019s carbon footprint by curbing carbon emissions by a remarkable 2,090 metric tons per annum, which is equivalent to the environmental impact of planting over 48,000 trees.",
    "\u201cI would like to congratulate the Unilever Sri Lanka team for initiating this rooftop solar mechanism in the Horana manufacturing facility. It helps with the factory\u2019s power generation as well as contributes towards national targets of renewable energy. With the targets that we\u2019ve set for 70% renewable energy carbon neutrality by 2050, there needs to be more private participation in the industry. I\u2019m glad that 2.33 Mw rooftop solar will contribute to about 1.5% of our own target for this year on rooftop solar facilities. Climate change is a real challenge and it has been witnessed in Sri Lanka more than ever, so we need to move away from traditional hydropower generation to solar, wind, biomass, new initiatives with battery storage facilities so that we can sustain energy requirements.\u201d said Kanchana Wijesekera , Minister of Electricity and Energy.",
    "Unilever Sri Lanka is a leading manufacturer and distributor of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) with a portfolio of 30 popular brands serving millions of Sri Lankans every day.

As part of this commitment, Unilever actively contributes to the Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), which outlines a comprehensive strategy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the entire business and value chain,\u00a0as part of this strategy Unilever Sri Lanka will increase total solar generation in its network to 4MWs in 2024.\u00a0Recognizing the urgency of climate action, Unilever aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2039. From 2024 onwards, climate change, nature conservation, plastic reduction, and supporting livelihoods have been identified as the cornerstones of Unilever\u2019s sustainability agenda, underpinning its commitment to responsible business practices.",
