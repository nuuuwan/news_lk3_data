### Israel launches strikes on Iran, risking escalation in Mideast wars

Israel pounded Iran with a series of airstrikes early Saturday, saying it was targeting military targets in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier this month.

Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though there was no immediate information on damage or casualties.

The attack risks pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran ‚Äì including Hamas in Gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon are already at war with Israel.

The Israeli military said Saturday it had launched ‚Äúprecise strikes on military targets‚Äù and, according to two Israeli officials, it was not targeting nuclear or oil facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren‚Äôt authorized to discuss the ongoing operation with the media.

Declares 50% salary cut for himself and 10% for other top public officials

Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is contemplating drastic steps to rescue his country‚Äôs ailing economy. On Wednesday, he voluntarily announced that he will take a 50% cut in his salary while ordering other top public officials to take a 10% cut.

The monthly salary of a sitting Maldivian President is MVR 100,000. However, President Muizzu will now receive only MVR 50,000.

The salary cuts cover all political appointees and staff of all state-owned enterprises, excluding banks. The take-home salaries of heads of these enterprises will be capped at MVR 90,000. The President has proposed that the salaries of heads of independent institutions and those of heads of the Judiciary and Parliament also be reduced by 10%. However, persons earning less than MVR 12,000 will be exempt from these cuts.

The cuts will be in effect for a two-year period, the President‚Äôs office said.

### Sri Lanka Tourism‚Äôs ‚Äúunsung hero‚Äù Renton de Alwis

I was lucky enough to associate with Renton for over two and a half decades. Maybe almost three, I believe. Memory goes back to ‚ÄúDe Alwis Advertising Agency‚Äù owned by Anandatissa de Alwis, where Renton was driving the agency. I was the Marketing Manager for Elephant Lite Corporation Ltd. (ELCL). Marketing ‚ÄúLaxapana‚Äù dry cell batteries and ‚ÄòDe Alwis‚Äô was our advertising agency. When we launched ‚ÄúFuji‚Äù batteries, as a very young marketing professional, strategic level advice received by visionary leader ‚ÄòRenton‚Äô was unmatchable. Input I received for my launch presentation by him made me a different person. Teacher, Advisor, Consultant and dear friend, it is so sad to miss you suddenly and the message was shocking news to me.

### FAO introduces innovative technologies to build resilience in Sri Lanka‚Äôs fisheries sector

*2024-10-26 00:59:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fao-introduces-innovative-technologies-to-build-resilience-in-sri-lankas-fisheries-sector-2/) ¬∑ `en`

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with funding from the government of Norway, has taken a significant step toward enhancing resilience and sustainability in Sri Lanka‚Äôs fisheries sector by handing over a multi-day fishing boat equipped with advanced cooling technology and a fuel-saving bulbous bow. This initiative promotes the adoption of new technologies to reduce post-harvest losses, lower operational costs, and improve the quality of fish for both local and export markets.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs multi-day fishing vessels, essential for deep-sea fishing, especially in the tuna export industry, often rely on ice to preserve fish during long voyages. However, this practice frequently compromises quality, leading to post-harvest losses. The Fish Loss and Waste (FLW) Assessment conducted by FAO in 2022‚Äì2023 found an average quality loss of 41.4% in the catch from Sri Lanka‚Äôs multi-day fisheries.

### State-hood and survival: Tamils, Palestinians and self-determination

Do Sri Lankan Tamil demands for a separate State or even ‚ÄòEelam‚Äô have the same status and legality within the international system as a Palestinian State?

Ultimately, the relative strengths and legitimacy of Palestinian claims to State-hood vs. Tamil claims to State-hood are based on the balance between the right to self-determination of one group vs. the right to maintain the existing territorial integrity of the other group. An interesting point to note is that in this thought experiment, the Northern Tamils are more analogous to the Jews than to the Palestinians. If this sounds counterintuitive, it is because comparisons of the two projects for State-hood are tenuous, as are attempts to make the rationale for one, a precedent for the other

### Peradeniya University student struggle of 1975-‚Äô76 and State suppression

*2024-10-26 00:46:57* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Peradeniya-University-student-struggle-of-1975-76-and-State-suppression/14-768426) ¬∑ `en`

The death of Peradeniya University student W.M. Weerasuriya, who was shot dead by police on 12 November 1976 during a student protest, was the beginning of the end of the then Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Her Government which took office in 1970 was deeply unpopular by then but the killing of Weerasuriya let loose public anger at her and led to the routing of the SLFP-led Government in the 1977 general elections.

Rajasinghe Bandara was a fellow student at the Peradeniya University at the time and decades later he has written about the experience and the State suppression of students in a book released recently on the 1975-1976 student movement.

Bandara who is now domiciled in the UK has written with a sense of personal loss on the authoritarian manner in which the student movement was crushed by the then Government and blood was spilt on the grounds of the University of Peradeniya.

The only way to find out electoral preferences of the state sector employees is to study the way the postal votes were casted during the elections. Prior to 1982, results of postal votes were not available on the website of the Election Commission. Starting from the Presidential Election of 1982 the postal vote preferences were indicated under each district in both Presidential and Parliamentary Elections except for the Presidential Election held in 1999 where the main contestants were Chandrika Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickremesinghe. For this analysis I have considered only the results of the Presidential Elections held from 1982 to 2024 except in 1999.

Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious island nation that has experienced both the triumphs and challenges of diversity. With a population comprised of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, and other ethnic groups, the country‚Äôs identity is inherently pluralistic. Ethnic diversity can be a source of strength, providing a rich tapestry of cultures, perspectives, and talents that can drive national development. However, Sri Lanka‚Äôs history also reflects the dangers of ethnic division, with conflicts that have significantly hampered progress.

Former minister Ali Sabri, who has posted a record on his official 'X' site, said that the current government has benefited from the support of the unions when the current government was opposed.. However, when they are in office, the connection is forced to recover and handle it properly.

At the same time, Ali Sabri has warned that if it does not handle this properly, the pressure from the trade unions can become an important obstacle for economic restructuring and growth in the country.

He therefore urged the government and the unions to be excessively understood about their roles and responsibilities in the current situation.

Israeli strikes killed 38 people in Gaza and three journalists in Lebanon on Friday as growing worries about supply shortages in Gaza and international pressure for a cease-fire mounted.

The deaths reported by Gaza health officials were the latest in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where people have in recent days lined up for bread outside the city‚Äôs only bakery in operation.

They come a day after United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of ‚Äúeffectively dismantling‚Äù Hamas and implored both sides to revive negotiations.

Also on Friday, an Israeli airstrike on guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon killed three media staffers working for news outlets that are seen as aligned with Lebanon‚Äôs Hezbollah group and its patron, Iran.

Outside of now-collapsed buildings rented by various media outlets, cars marked ‚ÄúPRESS‚Äù lay covered in dust and rubble after the strike, Associated Press photos showed.
