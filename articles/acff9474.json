The 15th edition of the Sri Lanka Design Festival (SLDF) by The Academy of Design (AOD), to be hosted at the iconic Cinnamon Life Integrated Resort, presents a roadmap to leverage creative industries to support the nation\u2019s revival at this turning point. It\u2019s more than a festival\u2014a symbol of the country\u2019s resilience, a representation of how creativity and innovation can rebuild a nation\u2019s spirit and future.",

    "When we launched AOD in 2001, design was still a novel concept here. Fast forward to 2009, SLDF was born from the need to connect our emerging talent designers, artisans, manufacturers with global markets. SLDF has been instrumental in showcasing the potential of Sri Lanka\u2019s creative industries, not just as a talent pool but as a powerful economic driver.",
    "This 15th edition is deeply symbolic. Sri Lanka has been through immense challenges, yet here we are celebrating creativity as a force for renewal. This year\u2019s festival will be a turning point, showcasing our resilience and forward-thinking vision. We are expanding our reach, collaborating with South Asia, and positioning Sri Lanka firmly as the region\u2019s creative nucleus",
    "The platform, powered by AOD, has always been a demonstration of how creativity is such a powerful tool for nation-building from the ground up. In a post-crisis era, it is essential to inspire confidence not just within the country, but internationally. We\u2019ve built this 2024 platform to do just that. SLDF presents a global face for Sri Lanka, where our design talent, our sustainable manufacturing, and our creative industries come together to engage with the world and provide solutions that resonate with the greater crisis of climate and authenticity our world is currently facing whilst telling the story of \u2018Designed and Made in Sri Lanka.\u2019",
    "As we step into the next decade, our goal is to foster partnerships across South Asia, ensuring Sri Lanka is recognised as the creative nucleus of the region.",

John Keells Holdings has built more than just a building; they\u2019ve created a statement of what Colombo can be. Hosting SLDF here feels like the perfect fit. It\u2019s not just about celebrating design, but about creating experiences that position Colombo as a creative powerhouse. Cinnamon Life adds a layer to SLDF, showcasing the intersection of art, architecture, and lifestyle and a much-needed narrative around Colombo for Sri Lanka. Architecturally, it\u2019s a statement.

Fashion, paired with design, crafts a new narrative for Sri Lanka as a hub for creative industries, connecting us to a global audience.",

This industry has been pioneers in its collaboration and support towards establishing Sri Lanka Design Festival and bringing in the support of Mercedes - Benz Fashion Week to elevate this industry to its next stage was a natural progression and we are thankful to DIMO Sri Lanka for making this happen.",
    "The apparel industry itself has been quite visionary in supporting our mission with Brandix being SLDF main sponsor of 2009 and MAS in 2010 and since then an inspiring journey with the apparel industry began and our attempts in collaborating with it with design and showcasing it as the first big industry to transform to a creative industry. Today Sri Lanka Apparel has done that, it\u2019s not a cut and sew manufacturer but a design led creative industry. This year we have the fashion innovation runway and the South Asian Apparel Leadership Forum, showcasing this inspiring industry journey, one of sheer resilience. Myself and AOD have worked ever so closely since 2009 with this industry and I am excited about its future driven by innovation and the leadership it can give the region.",

    "India\u2019s involvement in this year\u2019s SLDF is as an emerging high-end market for Sri Lanka, both for tourism and exports. It is also an important step in positioning SLDF as a regional platform. India\u2019s creative industries are vast, and by partnering with them, we\u2019re fostering a cultural and economic dialogue that benefits both countries. This collaboration creates a network of shared vision, allowing South Asia to shine as a united front in the global creative landscape.",
    "Our partnership with India is a starting point for deeper collaborations, creating opportunities for talent exchange, business ventures, and strengthening our creative industries regionally.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0Looking to the future, how do you envision Sri Lanka\u2019s creative industries growing in the next decade, and what steps are necessary to ensure the country becomes a leader in this space?",
    "In the next 10 years, I see SLDF evolving into an unmissable event in the global creative calendar. We want to be a bridge that connects South Asia\u2019s diverse creative voices with the world. Our strategy is to foster talent development, attract global investors, and create a thriving creative economy. With this, we see Sri Lanka solidifying its position as a creative hub for South Asia. The steps we have taken \u2013 investing in education, fostering collaborations, and amplifying the creative industries have been crucial. Creativity backed by education and research is where we can make the most significant impact. AOD is working on several initiatives that will further integrate design thinking into various sectors, from manufacturing to tech. By focusing on innovation at all levels particularly at the grassroots we\u2019ll create a unique identity that will make Sri Lanka a leader in the global creative economy and as one that brings South Asia to the world in a modern and contemporary narration.",

These opportunities not only offer knowledge-sharing experiences but also provide a chance to meet and collaborate with like-minded individuals who are shaping the future of design and innovation.",
    "SLDF 2024 taking place from 7-10 November 2024 at Cinnamon Life is more than an event\u2014it\u2019s a statement of resilience, creativity, and renewal. As Sri Lanka charts its path forward, AOD and SLDF are building the foundation for a future powered by innovation and design.
