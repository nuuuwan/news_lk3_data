    "The President\u2019s Office has made the decision to curtail certain entitlements provided to former Presidents of the country. Accordingly, henceforth, the Government will not bear the expenses for utility payments related to the official residences of past Presidents.",
    "The decision had come to light recently when a Chief of Staff employed by a former President submitted last month\u2019s utility bills to the President\u2019s office for payment.\u00a0 However, he had been informed that the office would no longer cover the bills in the future, following the advice of the Attorney General.",
    "According to reports, the Attorney General has informed the office that, based on a past judgement by former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva regarding the entitlements and allowances for former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the office is obligated only to maintain the official residence and vehicle provided, along with a monthly fuel allowance."
