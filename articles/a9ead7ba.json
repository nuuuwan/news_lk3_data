    "Some government leaders\u2019 asset declarations, submitted to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption, are now in the public domain. They have become grist for the Opposition\u2019s mill. The political rivals of the ruling JVP-led NPP are in overdrive, trying to depict the JVP leaders as a bunch of hypocrites who have enriched themselves while pretending to be dependent on financial assistance from their \u2018Marxist\u2019 party even to satisfy their basic needs. But these critics have chosen to ignore the fact that some key Opposition politicians have not yet submitted their asset declarations.",
    "The assets of JVP full-timers, such as President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Ministers Wasantha Samarasinghe and Bimal Rathnayake and Deputy Minister Sunil Watagala, have received much media attention. The Opposition is using them to dispute the JVP\u2019s claim that its leaders are part of the proletariat and sharing in the economic hardships of the masses. The asset declarations submitted by some Opposition figures, including Namal Rajapaksa, too, have raised many eyebrows.",
    "Curiously, most of the politicians with assets that ordinary people can only dream of acquiring are without any known sources of income. Some of them say they have inherited wealth, and their claims remind us of Daisy  Aachchi\u2019s bag of gems. How they have amassed so much wealth is a big question. Politics has obviously become El Dorado for many individuals across the political spectrum.",
    "Lies, damned lies and asset declarations, one might say. In this country, politicians cannot be expected to reveal all their assets. Their asset declarations grossly understate their actual wealth. That they receive colossal amounts of money as donations for their election campaigns, and only a fraction of those funds is actually spent is public knowledge. Part of their campaign funds is invested through various fronts or stashed away here or overseas. It is not possible to trace their assets, the ownerless Malwana Mansion being a case in point. Black money has become footloose in today\u2019s world.",
    "An attempt is being made in some quarters to use the assets of the JVP leaders to bolster the view that they no longer belong to the proletariat, and over the years they have become part of the political elite. The 2024 regime change in Sri Lanka has been described as a victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie or aristocracy. Even some religious dignitaries have sought to propagate this view. A better description of what we witnessed last year may be a victory of the emerging elite over the entrenched elite.",
    "Wealth alone does not make elites. There is no universally accepted definition of elites, but the general consensus is that their most defining characteristics are disproportionate influence, control over resources, decision-making power, prestige and ability to reproduce their status across time. Some prominent non-JVP members of the NPP fit this description.",
    "The JVP used the NPP as a vehicle to ascend to power. In 2004, the JVP pulled out an impressive electoral performance, with the help of the political elite represented by the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga of aristocratic descent. Some JVP seniors are in the process of leaving their proletariat cocoon, as it were, and this political and ideological eclosion is evident from their wardrobe makeover and other lifestyle changes.",
    "What Sri Lanka has witnessed over the past several decades can be explained in the light of Vilfredo Pareto\u2019s theory of the Circulation of Elites. Pareto has argued that every society has elites holding the most power, wealth and influence, but their status is not permanent. They rise and fall. When one set of elites declines, it is replaced by another. There are two types of elites, \u2018Lions\u2019 and \u2018Foxes\u2019. \u2018Lions\u2019 are strong, conservative leaders relying on tradition, force and authority to dominate others.",
    "Time was when the leaders of Sri Lanka\u2019s main political parties came under this category; they have lost power to the \u2018Foxes\u2019, who are a cunning, innovative and manipulative lot, using persuasion, cleverness and new ideas to capture and consolidate power. According to Pareto, a society remains stable and prosperous so long as there is a healthy circulation of the aforesaid types of elites, but if they become closed, inept, corrupt and resistant to change, revolutions follow, with the new groups overthrowing them.",
    "Political parties also receive bribes in the form of campaign funds and various sponsorships for countless events, but only individual politicians are required to declare their assets. There is a pressing need to make it mandatory for all political parties to disclose their assets. One may recall that the UNP, during its long stay in the political wilderness, was reduced to penury, so much so that it could not even pay the utility bills at its headquarters, Sirikotha, towards the end of President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s rule.",
    "But following the January 2015 regime change, funds began to flow into its war chest and its candidates outspent their rivals in the run-up to the general election held a few months later. The first Treasury bond scam was committed in February 2015, and it has now been revealed that the UNP as well as many members of other political parties benefited from the largess of the bond scammers. How much the UNP, the SLFP, the SLPP, the JVP/NPP, the SLMC, the ITAK, etc., have received as campaign funds is anyone\u2019s guess.",
    "Political parties in power are known to maintain huge cash reserves, and this is why they do not resort to demonetising high-value currency notes, known as the purge of big bills, to flush out black money. Most of the newly issued 2,000-rupee notes are also likely to end up in the cash reserves of political parties, their members and other wealthy individuals.",
    "What the asset declarations at issue signify is that politicians of all hues have the wherewithal to look after themselves and their families. The ordinary public should stop deifying politicians and making sacrifices for political parties of their choice at the expense of the wellbeing of their loved ones, work harder, earn more, live comfortably and build up nest eggs.",
