    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s 2024 presidential election will be held as scheduled and efforts to rectify a purported error in the constitution are not an attempt to postpone it, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "Amaraweera told reporters following a party leaders\u2019 meeting held at the parliament complex on Thursday July 18 that the election will \u201cdefinitely\u201d be held.",
    "\u201cThe election will definitely be held, as soon as possible. There is no obstruction to it, and no one is trying to prevent it,\u201d he said.",
    "Any discussion on the 22nd amendment to the constitution has no bearing on the election, he insisted.",
    "\u201cThis is only about correcting a mistake. It can even happen after the election. There has been no dates announced for the next parliament session. It won\u2019t be gazetted. It will happen later. It\u2019s just correcting a mistake and there is no scenario where it could result in postponing the election,\u201d he said.",
    "However, opposition legislators charge that the government is engaged in a last-ditch attempt to postpone the presidential election by hurriedly presenting an amendment to what is purportedly a problematic provision in the constitution on the duration of a president\u2019s term in office.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re saying these things because they have nothing else to say. Otherwise it\u2019s baseless. The election definitely will not be postponed. We won\u2019t allow it. Any such thing in parliament has to be approved by a two-thirds majority,\u201d said Amaraweera.",
    "\u201cThere will not be a constitutional amendment bill. If there is one, we will not support it. It cannot be passed without us,\u201d he said, repeating that the election will definitely be held as scheduled.",
    "Chief opposition whip Lakshman Kiriella who also spoke to reporters after the party leaders\u2019 meeting expressed concern that the government was attempting to postpone the polls.",
    "\u201cParty leaders met today, but there was no mention of amending the constitution. But there is a chance that a constitutional amendment may be presented in parliament next week,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAfter July 17, the Election Commission has the power to announce the election. Why wait till the end of the month?\u201d he asked, referring to a decision by the Election Commission to not announce the nomination and election dates until the end of July.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re waiting 12 days more after the 17th. Why wait? It is very clear that this is to give time to the government to plan their games. That is the truth. We know immediately what government officials are up to,\u201d claimed Kiriella.",
    "Chairman of the National Election Commission R M A L Ratnayake told the media on Tuesday that the commission will publish the notice announcing nomination and election dates before the end of July.",
    "\u201cOur first task is to publish the notice on the election. From the day the notice is published, nominations have to be accepted between 16 and 21 days. The election should be held within four to six weeks of from the day of accepting nominations,\u201d said Ratnayake.",
    "\u201cThe candidates must have enough time to do their campaigns after handing over nominations. Time is also needed to cast postal votes and carry out other duties. The election date should also be convenient for the voters. For the acceptance of nominations, we have to consider cultural factors unique to a country like Sri Lanka. Some people consider things like the Rahu period. So we have to find a date that is suitable for everyone,\u201d he said.",
    "Ratnayake said the election commission intends to issue the notice before the end of July.",
    "\u201cThis notice will contain the nominations date and the election date. We plan to then hold the election on the most suitable day after September 17.",
    "\u201cSome people had suggested that we have delayed this to end July to the benefit of one party or another. I want to point out that we can delay we can extend it to August 20 if needed,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul18/2024)"
