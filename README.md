Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran’s runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country’s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.

Pezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran’s Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian’s modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.

A vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili’s 13.5 million in Friday’s election. Overall, Iran’s Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors.

The entire loan amount is denominated in US dollars, totaling USD 100 billion. As you know, our country manages both domestic and foreign debts, with foreign loans typically in dollars.

### Explanation of the relief received

Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Central Bank Governor of Sri Lanka, discussed the relief offered by bilateral debt restructurings, emphasizing that such relief is extended universally to all countries facing similar situations. He highlighted two main forms of relief: extending the repayment period and reducing interest rates, both aimed at easing the debt burden. Weerasinghe also addressed criticisms about unfair loan comparisons between countries, stating that the focus should be on each country's unique circumstances rather than direct comparisons. He clarified that the goal of seeking such relief is not to favor one country over another but to manage national debt effectively and ensure economic stability.

Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says that the relief provided by bilateral debt borrowers has been given the relief to Sri Lanka.

He was speaking at an interview to educate the restructuring of debt.

The Central Bank Governor further explained that comparing Sri Lanka is not a right to provide credit relief to various countries.

"There are several ways to provide credit relief when it comes to agree with bilateral creditors. If you have to pay in 10 years, the basic debt, get paid 20 in 20 if you bought $ 100. In fact, the 100 rupees will be borrowed today and will be able to pay for 10 years in 10 years.. One is the relief. Bilateral borrowers give this process to all countries by extending the time to pay the debt. "

"The second relief is like 2% more than 3%, 4%, 5%, 5%, 6%. Decreases time to reduce interest rates. When the two adds, our debt is a significant amount of value. The end result, which is 30% less than 30%. "

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming through official channels gained 11.4 percent to $3.14 billion in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The remittances in June were $519.6 million, 9.2 percent up from the same month last year, the official data showed.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods.

The island nation witnessed a 57 percent jump in remittances coming through formal banking channels to $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier, helped by elimination of parallel exchange rate.

The island nation has been in the process of sending more migrant workers to bring in higher foreign exchange since the country declared bankruptcy in 2022.

The systemic stigmatisation of minority religious groups during a global health crisis not only violates medical ethics but also exacerbates societal divisions, especially in a country scarred by decades of civil war

Sri Lanka initially stood out as a success story in South Asia during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. However, this success wasn’t merely luck or a reflection of a robust health system. Instead, it was largely attributed to the impending parliamentary elections. These elections, originally slated for 25 April 2020, became a significant factor in the Government’s response to the crisis. With a new Executive President elected on 16 November 2019, and the dissolution of Parliament on 2 March 2020, the timing of the pandemic’s emergence and the subsequent actions taken by the Government were intricately tied to political considerations

Sri Lanka is grappling with a severe cost-of-living crisis rooted in pervasive political corruption. Political intermediaries profit at every stage, shifting the burden onto consumers. The economy has plummeted due to corrupt leaders using the government to further personal agendas and misusing public funds on unproductive projects while simultaneously selling national assets and depleting public reserves. Under such deceptive governance, our future hard work and increased taxes will be in vain, offering no relief to ordinary citizens as corrupt politicians continue to siphon off surplus funds.
