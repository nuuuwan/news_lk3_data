“Most ignorance is vincible ignorance. We don’t know because we don’t want to know” – Aldous Huxley (Ends and Means)

During her 107-day presidential election campaign, Kamala Harris (having inherited the Democratic Party candidacy after the precipitous departure of Joe Biden) tried to project herself as the true change agent. That image was blown to smithereens on the talk-show ‘The View’, just a month before the election.

### Tragedy at Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks is much more than meets the eye

*2025-10-01 05:34:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Tragedy-at-Na-Uyana-monastery-killing-seven-Buddhist-monks-is-much-more-than-meets-the-eye/14-782438) · `en`

It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material

The tragedy that occurred at internationally famed Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks on the spot and injuring six other Bikkus is another heartrending news that shocked the entire Sri Lanka within the last one month. From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.

Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.

The varied public response to recent incidents ranging from the arrest of Ranil Wickremesinghe, former president and prominent politician of Sri Lanka to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, American right-wing political activist, evidence that our assessment of, and response to, events are primarily based on our like or dislike of the individual, or individuals, involved rather than on an objective and unemotional interpretation of the underlying facts. When we base our opinions and conclusions on our likes or dislikes of the individual rather than on the facts, we undermine the principles of fairness, justice, ethics, and integrity that underpin our society.

### Murdered crime figure linked to 2012 Thajudeen case

Police yesterday disclosed that an underworld figure killed in Middeniya earlier this year had been inside a vehicle that pursued rugby player Wasim Thajudeen shortly before his death in 2012.

Acting Police Media Spokesperson Nihal Thalduwa said the man, identified as Anura Vidanagamage, known as “Middeniya Kajja”, was recognised by his widow in relation to the case.

Investigators believe Vidanagamage was among those who followed Thajudeen’s car on the night of his death. Thajudeen, a former national rugby player, was found dead in his vehicle in May 2012. Although initially reported as a car accident, the case was later reclassified as a homicide.

Vidanagamage, alleged to have ties to organised crime, was shot dead in Middeniya earlier this year. Police said his role in the Thajudeen case has now resurfaced during ongoing probes into underworld activity and unresolved high-profile killings.

COLOMBO (News 1st); A major breakthrough has emerged in the long-running investigation into the death of national rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, who died under suspicious circumstances on May 17, 2012, near Shalika Grounds in Narahenpita.

Initially classified as a car accident, the case was investigated by the Narahenpita Police and the Borella Crimes Investigation Division. Based on their findings, the death was deemed accidental, and the case was closed.

However, in 2015, then-DIG of the Colombo Range, Gamini Mathurata, submitted a report to then-IGP N.K. Illangakoon, prompting the transfer of the case to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). A comprehensive investigation followed, revealing that the initial post-mortem had been improperly conducted, raising serious doubts about the cause of death.
