In this new era should the absence of a Muslim or Tamil in the Cabinet matter at all?

Yet, one or two Muslim ministers in the Cabinet carries economic value in the international arena. When the Sirimavo Government in the 1970s faced a foreign exchange crisis the Muslim minister Badi was sent to the Middle East to canvas for more foreign aid from the Arab world and he succeeded to a certain extent. Similarly, when JR‚Äôs open economy faced an oil crisis his Muslim Foreign Minister Hameed was dispatched to Libya and Ghaddafi did not send his visitor empty handed. Thus, given the seriousness of the economic challenges facing the NPP Government, at least one talented Muslim minister in the Cabinet would be an invaluable asset to tackle them. Let common sense prevail and the damage caused rectified by the President

The absence of a Muslim member among the 21 members that comprise the Cabinet remains unanswerable

The recently elected NPP Government appointed its Cabinet of Ministers this Monday, 21 November. A large proportion of the members are new faces but appear an intelligent and able lot.

The active roles played by the Muslim community at large both at the Presidential as well as the General election in favour of the NPP was duly acknowledged and accepted by the NPP and the President. While anxiety must be pouring through and amongst almost all the new faces in the Parliament, a feeling of anger is pouring through among the Muslim community. Both feelings are quite natural.
