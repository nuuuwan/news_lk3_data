    "Sri Lanka Women's skipper Chamari Athapaththu scored another match winning century to lead her team to a historic series-winning nine-wicket victory over New Zealand Women in Galle.",
    "Athapaththu slammed 140 off just 80 deliveries, her second century of the three match series, to ensure Sri Lanka chased down a revised target of 196 off 29 overs and claimed their first ever series win over New Zealand.",
    "Athapaththu struck 13 boundaries and nine sixes, and associated in a record 190-run partnership with Nilakshi de Silva that was Sri Lanka's highest for any wicket.",
    "In a rain-affected match, New Zealand scored 127 for 2 in 31 overs, Suzie Bates top scoring with 63.",
    "It meant Sri Lanka would need to chase a revised target of 196 in 20 overs, and victory appeared an unlikely outcome when the hosts were 6 for 2 in the fourth over.",
    "But Athapaththu took it upon herself to power Sri Lanka to a historic win, with de Silva finishing unbeaten on 48 off 68 balls."
