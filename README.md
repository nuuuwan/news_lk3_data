### Overhead bridge being used for multiple purposes

*2024-11-06 05:45:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Overhead-bridge-being-used-for-multiple-purposes/14-768875) · `en`

The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (Drieberg’s Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets – smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

### Rethinking Central Bank independence in Sri Lanka’s development journey

*2024-11-06 05:38:36* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rethinking-Central-Bank-independence-in-Sri-Lanka-s-development-journey/4-768873) · `en`

Although an independent CBSL is intended to operate free from political interference, it remains heavily influenced by IMF directives, fostering dependency on IMF guidance

In September 2023, after 73 years, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) gained formal independence with the enactment of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act (Act 16 of 2023), replacing the Monetary Law Act. This step towards autonomy, largely influenced by conditions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aims to shield the CBSL from political influence. The rationale is straightforward: an independent central bank prevents political leaders from manipulating monetary policy, especially during election cycles, to boost short-term economic growth and re-election chances. However, the implications of this shift warrant deeper analysis as it could lead to unintended economic consequences for Sri Lanka.

### Strategic focus and agility in unpredictable markets

One of the greatest challenges for commercial leaders is balancing immediate needs with long-term growth strategies

Commercial leaders today are tasked with steering their organisations through increasingly unpredictable markets. Maintaining strategic focus while being agile is crucial for weathering sudden disruptions. Leaders must balance the long-term vision with the need to adapt swiftly to unforeseen challenges, requiring a deep understanding of market factors like consumer behaviour, competitor activity, and regulatory shifts. Regular reassessment of strategic objectives is key, and when market conditions change, quick pivots are critical.

Agility doesn’t mean losing sight of the long-term strategy; it enhances execution by empowering teams to make informed, real-time decisions. Scenario planning is essential for staying aligned with core goals while adjusting to evolving conditions. This blend of focus and agility helps organisations remain proactive and adaptable.

Trump’s campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected.
