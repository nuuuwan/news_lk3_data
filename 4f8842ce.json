    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena said that the development of electric vehicles in the island nation was held back in the past due to their high retail cost and low acceptance by customers most significantly as there are not enough recharging and re-fuelling points.",
