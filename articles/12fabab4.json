    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s is seeing a growing demand for coffee amid a revival in tourism and efforts are underway to lift skills and improve quality down the value chain as part of efforts to broaden the island\u2019s coffee culture, industry officials said.",
    "Lanka Coffee Association, made up of companies involved in the industry, with Australia-funded Market Development Facility is holding the Sri Lanka Coffee Festival in Galle in June.",
    "Coffee sales in caf\u00e9, are picking up partly helped by the tourist industry.",
    "\u201cA lot of tourists especially in Colombo and down South appreciate a good cup of Sri Lankan coffee and that makes up a lot of the caf\u00e9\u2019s demand,\u201d Country Director for the Market Development Facility, Maryam Piracha, says.",
    "As part of efforts to lift the industry, competitions will be held around the country to recognize the best baristas, or the people who serve customers in coffee bars.",
    "\u201cWe will judge them on flavor and technique and less emphasis will be given to presentation,\u201d Lanka",
    "The Barista competitions will be held at Jetwing Hotels in Dambulla, Galle and Colombo. The main Coffee Festival will be held in Galle on 7 June.",
    "The Jetwing group is supporting Sri Lanka coffee as part of efforts to promote locally sourced products. In the group hotels local fruits and vegetables are used.",
    "\u201cWe use locally sourced coffee in our hotels,\u201d says Dmitry Cooray, Managing Director of Jetwing Hotels.",
    "Coffee is believed to have been introduced to Sri Lanka around 1540 by Arabic travellers but was first planted on a commercial scale during Dutch rule.",

    "Samararathne, who is also general manager of the Colombo Coffee Company said.",
    "\u201cThat is because even prior to that we have a gap between the demand and supply but now that gap has been widened \u2013 the volume has dropped almost from 50 percent compared to previous one (harvesting season)",
    "\u201cAnd with that developing the quality becomes the problem. Because the moment there is a gap between the demand and the supply, everyone is trying to see how quickly they can sell their product.",
    "\u201cAnd there is a huge demand and anyone is willing to buy anything.\u201d",
    "Analysts say higher prices may incentivize farmers to grow more coffee, which should expand supply in the future.",
