According to trade unions, due to the economic pressure caused by the increase in the cost of living and the tax burden, the allowance has been increased to Rs. 25,000 but is currently limited to officers in the executive service of the public sector.

### A Child’s Guide To Debt & Restructuring: Country Driven To Economic Collapse Has Not Many Options

Aseni, the whiz kid has been alive to the debate over the debt situation of Sri Lanka. Despite her familiarity of the subject as a student of economics and finance, she says that she has not been able to comprehend many arguments presented by those who are pro or against the restructuring of the country’s debt. She turned to her Grandpa, Sarath Mahatthaya, a retired official of the Ministry of Finance, for help. The following is the interaction between the two on the issue.

Aseni: Grandpa, I have listened to the address of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to the nation last month and to the Parliament early this month over the success of his Government in reaching an agreement with bilateral creditors to restructure Sri Lanka’s external debt. He tagged this as ‘Good News’ drawing on terminology used by Bible writers. But his message was unclear to me. What was it?

### Worsening external deficit to improve fiscal deficit: Jumping from frying pan into the fire

Are we taking the right measures to address the debt problem?

After a disastrous handling of the economy during and in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, the then President was unceremoniously (and possibly justifiably) removed from office. But is the economy on the right track since then?

The relative stability of the economy since mid-2022 was broadly due to the following:

2. Increase in rainfall in mid-2022, which eased the power cuts. As the rainfall reduced towards the end of 2022, electricity tariff was increased sharply which reduced demand.

3. Halt of service of foreign debt which decreased foreign currency outflows.

4. Exorbitant increase in interest rates and depreciation of currency in mid-2022 which plummeted demand for imports and eased foreign currency outflows. While interest rates have fallen sharply in recent months, Rupee has also strengthened to an extent.

### Will environmentalists stall new 50MW Mannar wind power project?

Instead of protesting against an RE project, which will contribute to Sri Lanka’s much needed energy security and take us a step forward towards freedom from fossil fuels, why aren’t these protestors doing some real environmental work on the ground?

Recently a group of environmentalists and a religious leader approached the Supreme Court against a renewable energy project to come up in the country’s north.

Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Throughout its post-independence history, Sri Lanka has been a big consumer and a bad saver

The Central Bank alone had a foreign debt obligation of $ 6 billion, converting its foreign reserves to a net negative position of $ 2.5 billion. The country should repay all its foreign debt when it will become due, not merely the central government foreign debt. It would have been better had the President spoken of the total country foreign debt position as the Head of the State without confining himself to a small fraction of the central government debt

*2024-07-07 23:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187931) · `ta`

India started its new era with a loss in Harare but clinched the T20 series against Zimbabwe with a 100-run win in the second match.

Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar starred with the ball.

🟩

The first attempt towards India's new era began with a defeat in Harare last Saturday (06).

However, India won the second international T20 cricket match on Sunday (07) at the same stadium and won the series by 100 runs.

Abhishek Sharma, who faced only 47 balls, scored 100 runs with 7 pounds and 8 sixes.

When offered a second time in 1970, he declined again. When 1977 general elections were approaching, SJV decided the issue with cryptic words “I have taken no for an answer twice” and clinched the selection in his own favour.

### The Politics & Implications Of The US Supreme Court’s Immunity Ruling

In a split ruling last Monday, apparently for the ages, the conservative majority of the US Supreme Court gave Donald Trump a get-out-of-jail card and virtually iron clad protection from criminal prosecution. The majority ruling grants Trump and “all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party,” absolute immunity for core constitutional acts, presumed immunity for all other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial acts. The latter immunity is arguably rendered more ostensible than real by the ruling’s rigid guidelines that forbid using facts from the sphere of official acts as evidence to prove criminality in unofficial acts. So much so, writing for the three liberal judges of the Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor denounced the majority ruling and rejoindered: “With fear for our democracy, I dissent.”

This initiative aims to restore the hospital's surgical units and improve medical services efficiency. The parliamentarian is awaiting responses from relevant officials, including Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna, Dr. Ketheswaran Arumugam, VPSD Pathirana, and the GMOA.

🟩

Parliamentarian Anganjan Ramanathan said that the Chavakachcheri Resource Hospital is ready to get a temporary power supply.

I have been consistently looking at the problem of the ongoing problem at the Chavakachcheri Resource Hospital for recent days.

In the past days, the hospitals, including the hospital's accident and the surgery category, have been found to be in the absence of medical use, due to the lack of power backups and the lack of appropriate e -mail.

Recognizing the need to end the workplace carried out by the doctors to obtain objections to the launch of the sections in this context, I have held discussions with the enthusiasts on this issue.

Accordingly, some of the lovers have come forward to obtain the temporary arrangement for the Chavakachcheri Resource Hospital until the government is provided with adequate powerful facilities.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that some individuals are attempting to disrupt the country’s economic progress.

He announced that despite the economic crisis, the government has managed to implement salary increases for public servants this year and assured that necessary allocations will be made in the upcoming budget.

During the last economic crisis, some suggested cutting 500,000 public service jobs due to an inability to pay government salaries. However, the President stated that he did not follow this advice and instead increased VAT to 18% to ensure salaries were paid on time. He also emphasized that the tax burden on the people cannot be increased any further.

President Wickremesinghe made these remarks at the Uva Provincial Community Police Committee members’ empowerment workshop, held yesterday (06) at the Wellawaya Public Stadium under the theme “A Law-Abiding Country.”
