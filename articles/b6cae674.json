    "Fonterra Brands Lanka, in collaboration with the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), the Department of Labour and eight other dairy industry peers, introduced Sri Lanka\u2019s first National Competency Standard tailored for dairy machine operators.",

    "The Competency Standard handover ceremony was graced by Vocational Education Deputy Minister Nalin Hewage, marking a landmark moment in the country\u2019s vocational education landscape. This initiative reflects a shared commitment to formalising skills within the dairy sector and empowering experienced machine operators who have worked for many years with high skill levels but without any recognised qualification. Developed over a year, the Competency Standard was designed, funded, and validated through a multi-stakeholder effort, positioning the dairy industry as a proactive contributor to national skills development.",
    "The Competency Standard will now be implemented through NAITA\u2019s training network, enabling broader access for machine operators across Sri Lanka to gain formal recognition and enhance their career prospects.",
    "Deputy Minister Nalin Hewage said: \u201cFonterra Brands Lanka holds a respected name in the industry, having made significant contributions to the country and played a pioneering role in this meaningful initiative alongside other stakeholders. On behalf of the Ministry, we deeply appreciate these collective efforts.\u201d",
    "A spokesperson for TVEC remarked: \u201cThis was a much-needed qualification which is a great value addition not only to those already in the industry but also to newcomers. The initiative came into being because there was substantial demand for it. We are thankful to all who made it possible.\u201d",
    "The Competency Standard is expected to serve as a national benchmark for vocational training in the dairy sector, aligning practical industry expertise with formal vocational standards. It also reinforces the importance of public-private partnerships in driving sustainable workforce development. Speaking at the event, Fonterra Brands Lanka General Manager \u2013 Sri Lanka and Local Emerging Markets Fazlan Faizal said: \u201cThis Competency Standard is the result of a year of dedicated collaboration, driven by our belief that every skilled individual deserves formal recognition. We are proud to have partnered with NAITA, TVEC, the Department of Labour, and our industry peers to bring this vision to life, not just for our employees, but for the entire sector. As we move forward, Fonterra is ready to offer the fullest support as an organisation, as part of the dairy sector and as a proud contributor to Sri Lanka\u2019s progress to help upskill the nation\u2019s workforce and help the country\u2019s development.\u201d",
    "This initiative is more than a corporate milestone, it\u2019s a meaningful contribution to Sri Lanka\u2019s vocational education system. By leading with collaboration and a shared vision, the dairy industry is helping build a more capable, competitive, and future-ready workforce."
