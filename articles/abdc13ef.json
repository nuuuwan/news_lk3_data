    "The Sri Lanka Shippers\u2019 Council, led by its Executive Committee, conducted a comprehensive visit to the Hambantota International Port (HIP) last week, emphasizing its critical role in Sri Lanka\u2019s future economic development an HIP press release said.",
    "Chairman of the Council, Sean van Dort who headed the 42-member delegation said it had been a pleasure for Council members to visit the Hambantota Port. \u201cComparing 2017 to now, we see drastic positive changes that have taken place and we have no hesitation in recommending this beautiful facility that only has the potential to grow and be a diamond in the crown of Sri Lanka,\u201d he added.",
    "The visit centred around inspecting HIP\u2019s current facilities and discussions on future plans, with the port\u2019s management team, who briefed the Council on upcoming developments and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. During the discussions, the Council delegates inquired about additional shipping lines calling at HIP and the prospect of establishing a feeder service from Hambantota to Colombo. HIP officials indicated that while negotiations are ongoing with shipping lines, current trade volumes did not yet warrant a dedicated feeder service, the release explained.",
    "Chullante Jayasuriya, Honorary member of Sri Lanka Shippers Council said, \u201cThis is my second official visit. The first one was in 2016 when we were here for the 50th Anniversary of the Sri Lanka Shippers Council, and what I saw today was the remarkable development and progress that the port has achieved in a mere span of eight years, and it all goes very well for the future of the country and for the future of the economy of the country. We had three very impressive presentations by the port\u2019s senior management, which left nothing to doubt. They also showed us their plans for the future. I have every hope that these plans will come to fruition and that we will have a second international-class port in the south of the country.\u201d",
    "On their 2016 visit to HIP, to mark the new Shippers Council\u2019s 50th anniversary, they had planted 50 king coconut and cashew plants at the port. This time too council members planted king coconut trees to commemorate their visit and support HIP\u2019s green initiatives.",
    "Visiting members of the Shippers Council represented some of the most esteemed institutions in Sri Lanka. A key point they raised at the discussion was the need for improved connectivity, suggesting a rail line between Hambantota and Colombo to ease transportation costs and congestion, particularly when Colombo Port is at full capacity.",
    "Bindu Ranasinghe, Deputy General Manager HIP, while acknowledging the importance of the request, clarified that rail infrastructure was outside HIP\u2019s current scope. However, he informed the council that the port was actively engaged in exploring cost-effective transport alternatives to benefit the country\u2019s shippers and consignees.",
    "The Sri Lanka Shippers\u2019 Council, established over 50 years ago, represents a significant portion of the country\u2019s import/export trade, with its membership spanning Chambers of Commerce, Trade Associations, and several other diverse organisations. The Council remains committed to advocating fair freight rates, preventing surcharge increases, settling trade disputes, and advancing shipping awareness.",
    "The latest visit to HIP by the Sri Lanka Shippers Council further affirms the support extended to the port.\u00a0 It is also an acknowledgment of the pivotal role HIP plays in strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s position in the global trade network and its evolution into a world-class hub in the southern region of the island.",
