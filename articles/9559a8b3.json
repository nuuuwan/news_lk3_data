    "\u201cThe OCC now looks forward to receiving from Sri Lanka all information necessary for the OCC to ensure comparability of treatment,\u201d the group said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThe OCC also expects that the Sri Lankan authorities will continue to engage with their private creditors to find as soon as possible an agreement on terms at least as favourable as the terms offered by the OCC.\u201d",

    "Since the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and Sri Lanka agreed on the main parameters of a debt treatment consistent with those of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement between Sri Lanka and the IMF on November 23, 2023, the OCC and Sri Lanka furthered discussions in order to finalize the agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).",

    "On June 26, 2024, the OCC and Sri Lanka finalized the MoU, based on the main parameters of the debt treatment agreed in November 2023. The progress on the MoU had enabled the IMF staff to present to the IMF Executive Board the second review of Sri Lanka\u2019s EFF arrangement and thus open the way for approval of the third disbursement under the arrangement.",
    "The OCC commends the Sri Lankan authorities for their continuous efforts in implementing the reforms necessary for their country\u2019s return to a sustainable path.",
