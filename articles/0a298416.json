    "This article marks Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s 100th birth anniversary, reflecting on his impactful legacy as a leader of Sri Lanka.",
    "A month before the shameful ethnic riot broke out in Colombo in June 1983, a top-secret intelligence assessment was sent from the Near East South Asia office of the Central Intelligence Agency to Washington. The assessment made a few key judgments: \u2018President J. R. Jayewardene\u2019s United National Party (UNP) government will continue to dominate Sri Lanka until at least 1989.\u2019 The results of the October presidential election and the December referendum to extend the life of the current UNP-controlled Parliament for six years were seen as a personal triumph for the healthy 76-year-old President and a strong vote of confidence in his leadership and Western-style, free enterprise economic policies. The fresh mandate provided Jayewardene an opportunity to complete Sri Lanka\u2019s transition to a high-growth, free-market economy with several ambitious development projects aimed at self-sustained growth.",
    "However, the paper (Sri Lanka: Jayewardene\u2019s approach to Democracy and Free Enterprise declassified by the CIA) further assessed that economic growth brought thorny problems. The government borrowed heavily to pay for development that would not yield dividends for several years. The UNP\u2019s most urgent priority was to curb massive deficits in the national budget, which accounted for an unusually high percentage of gross domestic product. The country faced growing strains in its balance of payments, and overall economic stability was a concern. Jayewardene\u2019s re-election implied that Sri Lanka would continue playing a moderate and constructive role in world forums, maintaining a pro-Western orientation while seeking to promote investment opportunities. The UNP\u2019s dominance and the weakness of traditional opposition parties enhanced political stability but also risked corruption and indifference within the party ranks.",
    "Communal disharmony was the most serious potential threat to Sri Lankan stability. Despite Jayewardene\u2019s commitment to fostering better relations between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority, powerful UNP members were less conciliatory, and Tamil dissidents were likely to launch sporadic terrorist attacks. This situation was expected to worsen if Tamil agitation for a separate state flared into widespread bloody confrontation. A significant concern was the impact on democratic practices and communal relations once Jayewardene left power, particularly if a less committed democrat inherited the presidency, the paper observed.",
    "What is most interesting is that this paper described the personalities of key political leaders in the country, including JRJ\u2019s successor. The CIA paper assessed the succession issue, stating, \u201cAlthough we believe that Jayewardene enjoys good health, his advanced age increases the possibility that he will die during his six-year term. Under the 1978 constitution, the Prime Minister, Ranasinghe Premadasa, would become Acting President until parliament chose a successor from among its members. As the undisputed leader of the UNP\u2019s Parliamentary contingent, we believe Premadasa would be the most likely candidate to be chosen to fill out Jayewardene\u2019s term. In this event, we would expect him to continue the UNP\u2019s free market, development-oriented policies.\u201d",
    "\u201cPremadasa, 58, sees himself as Jayewardene\u2019s heir apparent. Highly popular, capable, and hardworking, he displays a common touch that Jayewardene lacks and has proved himself a major vote-getter for the party. According to Embassy reporting, Jayewardene holds Premadasa\u2019s political skills in high regard, depends on the Prime Minister, and works closely with him.\u201d",
    "\u201cIronically, Premadasa\u2019s low-caste origins, which have undoubtedly added to his popular standing, could derail his succession to the presidency. Sri Lanka has been governed since independence predominantly by members of the goigama (cultivator) caste, the highest in status and numerically the largest. Premadasa is the only major political figure on the current scene who is of significantly lower caste, and Embassy reporting indicates that some elements in the UNP are anxious to prevent his succession. We believe recent suggestions that the constitution be amended to provide for an office of vice president reflect an attempt to thwart Premadasa\u2019s candidacy by appointing a suitably high-caste vice president who would then automatically succeed Jayewardene.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe UNP has thus far displayed none of the debilitating infighting that has plagued Sri Lanka\u2019s other major parties. Although presidential hopefuls are looking around for support, we see little prospect of any dramatic power plays as long as Jayewardene remains healthy.\u201d",
    "However, R Premadasa, the man who ruled Sri Lanka after JRJ, showing ample qualities of a statesman, ended his life on the street. He was killed by a suicide bomber identified as Kulaveerasingam Veerakumar (alias \u2018Babu\u2019) of the LTTE, an armed group initially financed and trained by India. Unfortunately, it is questions that torn the political fabric, as the political dynamics resembled a vicious battle. Premadasa\u2019s routine on the day of his death exemplified his dedication. Rising early at 4 am, he began with yoga and perused the newspapers by 5:15 am. Intent on addressing the ruling United National Party\u2019s rally at Colombo\u2019s Galle Face Green, he instructed his public relations officer to gather facts highlighting his presidency\u2019s achievements since 1988.",
    "Later that morning, at 11:30 am, Premadasa inspected the procession he would lead from Sugathadasa Sports Stadium to the rally. Despite security warnings about Tamil Tiger threats, he personally supervised the preparations, engaging with supporters along the route. Tragedy struck when a young man approached, concealing a bomb. The assassin was cleared through the security cordon by his valet, an LTTE plant in his household, and permitted entry to the inner circle. The explosion occurred, killing Premadasa and several others instantly, marking the end of a turbulent era in Sri Lanka\u2019s history.",
    "Premadasa\u2019s rise from humble beginnings in Keselwatte, a poor neighbourhood in Colombo, to the presidency epitomized his ambition and resilience. Despite his flaws, he remained deeply connected to his roots, yet his presidency was marred by controversies and violence that shaped Sri Lanka\u2019s future trajectory. His death, mourned by some and celebrated by others, closed a chapter in Sri Lankan history defined by both progress and profound challenges.",
    "His abbreviated leadership prompted many studies. Josine van der Horst\u2019s book explores the intricate connections between Buddhism and political power during R. Premadasa\u2019s presidency in Sri Lanka. It scrutinizes the aftermath of Premadasa\u2019s assassination, offering insights from informants who discussed the event\u2019s unusual circumstances and broader implications. Meanwhile, Rajan Hoole\u2019s critical examination in \u201cThe Arrogance of Power\u201d challenges the official narrative attributing Premadasa\u2019s assassination solely to the LTTE. Highlighting discrepancies in the investigation process and allegations of collusion within Premadasa\u2019s security detail, Hoole suggests alternative theories that cast doubt on the LTTE\u2019s singular culpability.",
    "Bradman Weerakoon\u2019s perspective in \u201cRendering Unto Caesar\u201d provides a detailed account of the immediate aftermath and subsequent inquiries into Premadasa\u2019s death. Weerakoon, a close associate of Premadasa, acknowledges public perceptions of LTTE involvement but questions the thoroughness of the investigation and the broader political context. He discusses intertwined narratives surrounding Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudali\u2019s deaths, noting unresolved political tensions and conspiracy theories that have persisted without a comprehensive independent inquiry.",
    "Writing a preface to the Premadasa Philosophy, Ranil Wickremasinghe, then the Prime Minister, noted, \u201cRanasinghe Premadasa was extraordinary in several senses. He was extraordinary in the magnitude of the social obstacles he faced and triumphed over. He was extraordinary in the extent of the creative constructive work he was able to do, positively changing the everyday life of large numbers of people. He was also extraordinary in the range and richness of his thinking. It is this last aspect which is brought out in sharp relief in this slender anthology of his thoughts. The range, depth, originality, creativity and sharpness of his ideas easily mark him out as a major political, social, and economic thinker, a major conceptual thinker, by any contemporary standard. Here then was the philosopher-politician, the profundity of whose thought is only matched by the sincerity of his compassion for people.\u201d",
    "Premadasa was a diligent reader, and he endeavoured to represent developing nations against extortion by wealthy countries. \u201cHowever far, however close, or however powerful any nation may be, it has no right to aspire to control another nation,\u201d Premadasa said. \u201cIt is these same imperatives, sanctity of territorial sovereignty and integrity, which lead the government and the people of Sri Lanka to condemn interference by major powers in the affairs of smaller states. Whether this interference is in Central Asia, Central America, or the Caribbean, it is unjustified. The existence of governments or the assumption of office by governments which are disliked by their neighbours, is no excuse for overt or covert intervention. External invasion, subversion, or destabilization is the theft of decision making from citizens of the nation. We in the Non-Aligned Movement may only be able to resist these intrusions with words. But let the words ring loud and clear \u2013 interference is wrong; interference is unprincipled; interference must stop,\u201d he said at the 8th Non-Aligned Conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1986.",
    "Premadasa\u2019s tenure was defined by significant economic reforms aimed at privatizing state enterprises and attracting foreign investment, alongside populist measures to alleviate rural poverty. However, his methods faced criticism for their ruthless suppression of dissent, including crackdowns on the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna rebels and alleged involvement in political assassinations. Despite efforts to engage with Tamil separatists like the LTTE through dialogue and military pressure, suspicions persisted regarding his handling of internal conflicts. His administration also struggled with heightened external interference in Sri Lanka\u2019s affairs, worsening internal crises. Despite these challenges, Premadasa made concerted efforts to uplift the country from poverty and achieve substantial economic transformation. Regrettably, Sri Lanka seems not to have fully absorbed the lessons from its past leaders\u2019 legacies, as political instability and external interference continue to afflict the nation.",
