### Election Commission gears up for LG polls

*2024-11-25 11:17:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103743/election-commission-gears-up-for-lg-polls-) ┬╖ `en`

The Election Commission is scheduled to convene this Thursday at 10.00 a.m., marking its first meeting since the conclusion of the 2024 general election.

A key focus of the meeting will be the upcoming Local Government (LG) Elections, with significant decisions expected regarding their timeline and preparation.

Minister Vijitha Herath, speaking at an event in Kandy, recently confirmed that the LG Elections are planned for January next year.

The Election Commission is reportedly committed to expediting the election process, following the court ruling emphasizing the urgency of holding the LG Polls at the earliest possible.

However, it is reported that challenges remain as no funds have been allocated for the election thus far.

A final decision on funding is expected after discussions, with the government anticipated to address this issue through the Interim Vote on Account scheduled for December.

### Sri Lanka can cut floor rate, but targeting тАШdysfunctionalтАЩ market will lead to trouble

*2024-11-25 11:16:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-should-not-suppress-call-rates-through-omo-if-market-is-so-dysfunctional-189613/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka is just emerging from a default after large volumes of money were printed to target a narrow policy rate, in the pursuit of instant growth (potential output) and denying monetary stability to the people.

From 2015 in particular Sri Lanka very narrowly targeted a policy rate despite being a reserve collecting central bank.

Targeting a mid-corridor rate is the same as printing money to maintain a single policy rate. The label is different but the required inflationism is the same.

The same consequences of targeting a mid-corridor rate in 2015 and especially 2018 when the budget deficit was brought down.

If the call money rate is so dysfunctional as claimed in a recent defence of money printing through OMO, it should obviously not be used as the operating target for monetary policy at all.

Since the end of the war the central bank has cut rates around 18 to 20 months after a currency crisis, just as private credit recovered and triggered a currency crisis.

My parliamentary political journey was the focus of social rights and social justice. Former Kandy district parliamentarian Velukumar said that even if it is not a Member of Parliament, the political journey towards the goal will continue.

тАЬMy parliamentary political journey began in 2015. Two times, I gave leadership to retain Tamil parliamentary representation in the Kandy district.

My actions were centered on social justice and social rights. I have spoken more about rights politics in Parliament.

My journey will continue in the same way. To make that journey, I will not be a Member of Parliament to achieve the goal.

Some political agents were leading the absence of Tamil representation of the Kandy district. Going to the gardens and even the votes. They showed the money. They spread rumors.

This caused confusion among the people. Not many people go to vote. People are well aware of who those political agents are. They are currently missing.

### Arugam Bay; hidden currents

There has been growing public concern over the recent weeks, about happenings in Arugam Bay (AB). This analysis adds to the discourse.

Democratic states are obliged to protect all people within its borders, whether citizens or non-citizens. Non-citizens include tourists on short stays, subject to the law of the land they visit.

Informed sources report that Jewish places of prayer have been set up for Israeli tourists in AB. Though few would object to people at prayer, this raises a concern. Why would tourists on short stays want this, when they can pray in their rooms?

A likely answer links two possibilities. Some of these tourists are here to stay longer and have been permitted to do so. And, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the construction or designation of a Jewish place of prayer for Israelis. The stringent regulations governing the establishment of new places of prayer or worship for our own citizens, makes this favour even more puzzling.
