### A Call For Unity: Seize This Rare Opportunity For Tamil Representation

*2024-10-01 11:11:30* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-call-for-unity-seize-this-rare-opportunity-for-tamil-representation/) · `en`

With the presidential election behind us and the parliamentary elections on the horizon, it is time for us, as representatives of the Tamil community, to act with clarity and purpose. Our people have endured decades of hardship, their basic rights eroded, and it is now our responsibility to ensure that these rights are restored. To achieve this, we must speak with one voice, unified under a common goal, to represent the needs and aspirations of the Tamil population.

In the past, we have allowed ourselves to become fragmented—split into various groups with disparate agendas. This has weakened our collective voice, and the end result has often been failure. We cannot afford to repeat these mistakes. Now more than ever, our people need a clear and unified leadership to negotiate with the central government. Splintered groups with incoherent demands will only continue the cycle of disappointment and missed opportunities. Our strength lies in unity, and we must act accordingly.

### In Sri Lanka deflation was common before the policy rate, IMF Second Amendment: Bellwether

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s deflation in September 2024 has created news, but all inflation was followed by deflation for over 200 years before currency depreciation (now called flexible exchange rate) and money printing for a policy rate.

Under the currency board from 19 century and the Central Bank under Bretton  Woods specie standard, Sri Lanka’s inflation  was broadly the same as the US and the rest of the world.

Under a fixed exchange rate to the Fed, inflation that went down came down and macro-economists could not generate permanent inflation and wage destruction.

For example from 1953 January when the Colombo Consumer Price Index was at 100.1, it was only 100.7 by August 1960.

From the early 1950s as the central bank began to print money, foreign exchange controls were gradually intensified.

It was in the 1960s that the US Fed, driven by ‘macroeconomic policy’ started to aggressive cyclical policy rate manipulation, leading to reserve losses (gold) and soaring gold prices.
