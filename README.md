An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth could produce northern lights in the U.S. this weekend and potentially disrupt power and communications.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week.

NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit to take precautions, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“For most people here on planet Earth, they won’t have to do anything,” said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues.

### Risk for boys with bodice -powered sports materials

*2024-05-11 11:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183211) · `ta`

Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa warns that sports materials containing chemicals like lithium, silver oxide, and alkaline can pose a risk to boys, potentially causing severe damage if swallowed. The short esophagus can lead to these materials reaching the stomach, causing respiratory blockage and even death. Immediate hospitalization is advised, with honey administered as first aid.

🟩

The Assistant Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association, Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa, said that the children will be affected by the sports material.

He said that the games played by the boys may be swallowed, or that there are potentials, or the ear and nose, as the types of chemical compounds such as lithium, silver oxide and alkaline are in the form of button.

The reason is that the first part of our diet canal (esophagus) is naturally short, so that when swallowing the bark can go into the stomach and cause severe damage.

This can cause a sudden explosion in the stomach, causing respiratory tract blockage and death.

Therefore, the children should be taken to the hospital immediately if they get caught in such accidents. He said that until the first aid is taken to the hospital, two teaspoons of clean honey should be given to the affected children once in 10 minutes.

The Colombo Tea Auction offering recorded a decline significantly, totalling 4.9 million kilogrammes.

There was improved demand and a dearer trend in prices for most teas on offer, perhaps triggered by the lower volume on offer against the backdrop of urgent shipments, Forbes and Walker Tea Brokers said.

The Ex-Estate offerings were reasonably maintained and totalled 0.74 million kilogrammes.

The Westerns – Select Best, on offer were irregular and often easier, whilst the others together with the teas in the Below Best and Plainer categories, were often firm and Rs.20-40 per kilogramme dearer. The Nuwara Eliyas were a weak feature and mostly unsold, due to a lack of suitable bids.

The Uda Pussellawa BOPs were barely maintained, whilst the corresponding BOPFs appreciated by Rs.40-60 per kilogramme. The Uva BOPs sold around last levels, whilst the corresponding BOPFs gained by up to Rs.100 per kilogramme.

*2024-05-11 01:38:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fitch-affirms-srilankan-airlines-government-guaranteed-bonds-at-c/) · `en`

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the rating on SriLankan Airlines Limited’s (SLA) USD175 million government guaranteed 7% unsecured bonds due 25 June 2024 at ‘C’. The rating on the bonds is driven by the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the government of Sri Lanka (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating: ‘RD’).

SLA did not pay the interest due on 25 December 2023 on its guaranteed unsecured bonds, or during the 30-day grace period that followed, triggering an event of default. This is in addition to previous missed coupon payments in June 2023 and December 2022, and the events of default triggered via the 12 April 2022 announcement by the Sri Lankan government of a debt moratorium on several categories of sovereign and public-sector entities’ external debt, as well as the ensuing non-payment of interest on the government’s external debt.

While President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Government has pulled Sri Lanka out of one of its worst-ever economic crises, the Government also needs to give special attention to issues such as plant health. Most village folk give much-needed attention to plant health despite problems such as shortage of fertiliser; but city folk generally do not bother much about plant health as they consider planting a tree to be the job of a servant. But good citizens need to be concerned about plant health and related issues because our health and the health of our planet depend on plants.

On Sunday, May 12, the United Nations (UN) marks International Day of Plant Health, with the focus being to raise global awareness on how protecting plant health can help end hunger, reduce poverty, protect biodiversity and the environment, and boost economic development.

What is the significance of the Election Commission’s (EC) announcement on Thursday that the next presidential election would be held between September 17 and October 16? It is a well-known fact to those who know the relevant Article of the Constitution. It would have only been relevant if the EC had announced the exact date for the election.

Although President Ranil Wickremesinghe has not declared his candidature for the forthcoming Presidential election, it is clear he has commenced his election campaign through vote-catching activities in various sectors, providing the voters with various goodies and freebies.

If we are going by a recent communication by the election monitoring body, the People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) to the Elections Commission (EC), what is shameful in this exercise is the President’s party, the United National Party (UNP) using public funds for these activities, abusing the powers of the President’s office.

Colombo, May 10 - Battery operated toys sold in the market are harmful to children, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa said.

Since these toys contain lithium, silver oxide and alkaline button batteries, children can swallow them, put them in their ears or noses, and if children swallow these batteries, it can even be fatal to the child through the electrochemical activities.

The first part of the alimentary canal (the esophagus) is naturally narrow, and the maximum damage can occur when these are swallowed, and the submerged battery can travel to the stomach and cause severe damage, Dr. Rajapaksa said.

He also said that even the stomach can be fatally damaged through this, and even life can be lost due to the blockage of the respiratory tract.
