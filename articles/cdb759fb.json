    "St. Maximilian Kolbe\u2019s Visits to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and His Impressions",
    "St. Maximian Kolbe, during his missionary travels to and from Japan, China and India, visted Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) in 1930, 1932 and 1933. The impressions he formed during these visits as recorded in his contemporary writings \u2013 letters, diaries, notes and article, provide a fascinating read.",
    "Whilst in transit and staying aboard a ship anchored in the port of Colombo for two days in March 1930 (March 24-25), St. Maximilian Kolbe and his fellow missionaries, Br. Zygmunt and Br. Seweryn visited several notable locations in the city of Colombo. These included the Colombo Catholic Press, described by him as \u2018the print shop of the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate (OMI)\u2019 which published \u201cThe Messenger of the Heart of Jesus\u201d in English and Sinhalese; a leading Catholic school; St. Anthony\u2019s Church, Kochchikade; and the Post Office to buy postcards. He also distributed the Miraculous Medals at the places he visited.",
    "In his notes, he also makes mention of the tropical \u2018summer heat\u2019, \u2018palm trees\u2019 (a likely reference to the coconut trees), the sight of \u2018a Buddhist monk\u2019, \u2018street cars\u2019 (tram cars) and \u2018cab drivers\u2019 in Colombo. He attentively observed the devotional gestures of the faithful \u2013 \u2018bowing\u2019, \u2018partly removing turbans\u2019, \u2018 joining hands\u2019, \u2018kneeling\u2019, and placing \u2018hands on the glass\u2019 of the vitrine encasing the statue of St. Anthony whilst praying to him. He calls them \u2018such good souls!\u2019.",
    "His notes of Tuesday, March 25, 1930 (Feast of the Annunciation of Most Holy Virgin Mary) record celebrating the \u2018Mass and Communion according to the intentions of the Immaculate, and speaks of a late afternoon \u2018typhoon\u2019, \u2018storm\u2019 and rain, and of \u2018jumping fish\u2019 being \u2018tossed here and there\u2019. In a parting remark, he also recorded that he had got into the boat to return to the ship, leaving the city of Colombo, \u2018taking along pleasant impressions.\u2019",

    "In the summer of 1932, St. Maximilian Kolbe visited Sri Lanka twice on his travels to and from India, en route from Japan and Hong Kong. In a letter to his superior in Warsaw, he recorded:",
    "\u2018On our way there we stopped in Hong Kong, where Fr. Wieczorek, a famous Salesian missionary, asked me why we were not establishing a Niepokalan\u00f3w in China (in Hong Kong). We also stopped in Singapore, where the Fathers of the Congregation of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary pointed out a site in China where a Niepokalan\u00f3w could be nestled, about an eight-hour train journey from Peking (which is not far, considering average distances in Asia).",
    "\u2018From there, we then crossed the Indian Ocean up to Colombo, on the island of Ceylon, which had belonged to India in the past. The crossing was rather miserable, though. The winds, called \u201cmonsoon,\u201d blew day and night, and the ship, apparently forgetful of its thousand-ton weight, listed horribly forward, backward, or sideways. Eventually, with a one day delay due to our struggle against the winds, we landed in Colombo, where I stayed a few days over at the Oblate Fathers of the Immaculata, who are involved in missionary work there. I intended to rest and re-gain my balance, to be ready to face the sweltering heat of train cars in the rays of the tropical sun.\u2019",

    "He rested for a few days at the House of the Oblate Fathers of the Immaculate in Colombo to regain his composure, before he travelled to Ernakulam in India by train. Commenting on the train journeys from Colombo to and from India, St. Maximilian wrote to Fr. Kornel Czupryk, his superior from Colombo on July 04, 1932:",
    "\u2018The journey here and back by train I did in second class. For the outward leg, in fact, at the Cook agency, where I had bought the ticket, I was told that the third class is prohibited (for a European), although later I became convinced that it was possible; but not for the return, because otherwise, before leaving India to go onward to Ceylon, I would have had to spend a five-day quarantine period in a field in countryside, in the midst of other indigenous people who might be infected with infectious diseases (malaria, cholera, and the like). Just spending any time in a situation like that, in a warm, foreign climate would be more than enough to bring down some kind of illness on me. In addition, the cost of spending that time there. Instead, I could sleep during the night and was not quite so hot, because there were electric fans. I think even our own, at least at the beginning, must travel the great distances across India in second class.\u2019 \u2026.",
    "\u2018Nevertheless the Immaculata, who had very lovingly assisted me all through my journey, helped me in this journey as well, so that my health was not made overly feeble over the day and two nights I spent on the train. The one thing I could not do was eat.\u2019",
    "\u2018A notice had been posted on train car doors warning against infectious diseas-es: malaria, cholera, etc. Also, I was beginning to ache here and there. What to do? At a station, I clung to hot coffee and drank: I swallowed quite a bit. It did me good. Then I threw out the \u201cmolangon\u201d\u201d (Indian fruit) to the monkeys that were roaming along the pavement, because I realized that that type of fruit did not agree with me. I trundled on, trying somehow to get to the end of the journey, to the town of Ernakulam, located in the Indian principality of Cochin, on the Malabar Coast.\u2019",

    "In 1933, he visited Sri Lanka for the third time, whilst in transit and staying aboard the ship, the Conte Rosso, anchored in the port of Colombo for about six hours. He gives a fascinating and vivid account of this brief visit in his article \u2018 Colombo: Impressions of a Trip to the Mission of Japan\u2019 published in Rycerz Niepokalanej, September, 1934, as follows:",
    "\u2018Toward midday\u2019 our ship Conte Rosso was nearing the port of Colombo, and at midday we could disembark. It was announced onboard that there would be meat for lunch, even though",
    "it was Friday. Moreover, until the time of departure, at six, there was not much time; so,",
    "having eaten some bread, cheese, and two green Indian oranges each, we went on land by",
    "motorboat, paying half a Ceylonese rupee, and headed toward the city.\u2019",
    "\u2018First of all, we went, on the Borella tram, toward the episcopal palace. The conductor and the driver, thankful for the two medals of the Immaculata that we gave them, decided to drop us in front of the bishop\u2019s palace. What good Hindus! The Immaculata will reward them for this. After visiting the small humble church situated beside the bishop\u2019s house, we walked on foot along the paved road-full of spat-out gobs of red gum, which the inhabitants chew untiringly-toward the house of the Missionary Sisters of Mary, to procure some hosts and candles. Along the way, we walked in the cooling shade of the trees, since it was really hot. In front of us, a lot of shops with bananas of different colors and thickness, coconuts, and other tropical fruits.\u2019",
    "\u2018The small church of the sisters is very sweet, more so since Jesus, exposed all day long in the Blessed Sacrament, welcomes people all day long. Coming out of the church we found a girl who kindly invited us to go into the parlor. It was clear that our Franciscan habits, somewhat foreign to Ceylon, had already been noticed. On the principal wall of the parlor, Jesus looked down from the cross, whilst at his feet there was a big and beautiful picture of the Immaculata crushing the infernal serpent\u2019s head with her immaculate foot. Evidently in the spirit of Niepokalan\u00f3w.\u2019",
    "\u2018Soon after, two nuns dressed in white greeted us. They were the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. The superior explained thoroughly that the aim of their institute is to go on mission in order to lead souls to Jesus, always through Mary, and that they belong to Mary, Mary is their Patroness and they are the property of Mary. She spoke to us about the numerous blessings bestowed by Mary,\u2026.\u2019",
    "\u2018We gladly accepted some soda water with ice: only he who travels in such tropical countries could appreciate its utility and value.\u2019",
    "\u2018In addition, we received both the hosts and candles; the sisters even wanted to take us to the ship, all this without our making any payment, for the sake of the Immaculata.\u2019",
    "\u2018Then, we again took the Fort tram to the last stop, at the harbor. Both the conductor and the driver accepted medals of the Immaculata. The tram driver explained to us that his conductor was Buddhist; however, his dark face, shining with joy, showed us that the medal would not go to waste.\u2019",
    "\u2018Here and there, the street was blocked by two-wheeled carts covered with a roof of palm leaves and drawn by small oxen with large humps. A large group of Hindu [in some places in his writings, St. Maximilian Kolbe refers to the native inhabitants of the Indian Subcontinent as\u2019 Hindus\u2019 not necessarily meaning their adherence to Hinduism] workers, dressed in a cloth that covered half of their bodies or in just a loincloth, was repairing a section of the tramline. Their dark bodies moved heavy picks. [Along the way we saw] the streets, always larger, the train station (from which we had left last year in search of the Indian Niepokalan\u00f3w), and the harbor.\u2019",
    "\u2018We wanted, however, to visit also a Pole who had been residing there for a long time, Mr. Roszkowski, proprietor of the Nippon Restaurant. We left the harbor, therefore, turned right, and, after some minutes of walking in the midst of the continuous importuning of the merchants, we arrived at a row of small, waiting buses. We looked for one of the fullest-close, therefore, to departing-marked Slave Island, and we climbed up through the back door, into the middle of dark-skinned people, more or less dressed, residents of the area. Barefoot and indistinguishable from the other travelers, the conductor or the owner collected three cents from each person, and so, without losing time bothering with tickets, which in any case are a sign of mutual distrust, we get off in front of a recently constructed church, and from there, after barely 15 steps, we reach the Nippon Restaurant.\u2019",
    "Vases of flowers in front of the restaurant. We entered. On the wall, a picture of Our Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa, and in front of it a small lamp; it was clear that it was the house of a Pole. Then, on top of a small cabinet, there was a statue of the Immaculata sent over from Niepokalan\u00f3w: he was, therefore, also a reader of Rycerz. The proprietor was seated at a table and was finishing his midday \u201cdinner\u201d (the evening meal is called \u201csupper\u201d), a red dish of a gelatinous type. He immediately stood up: we greeted him and he invited us to eat with him. We drank coffee, ate some sweets, and lost ourselves in conversation. He tells us that he had just returned from hunting.",
    "\u201cThe most diverse. Yesterday evening, the house I was at, we captured a small boa in the kitchen. A boy crushed its head and it made such a noise. Fortunately, it was not a poisonous serpent. I gave it still alive to the Japanese consul. After four in the evening, the reptiles come out of their hiding places; they bask in the heat of the setting sun, and then in the dark of the night they go hunting. At dawn they again enjoy the warmth of the sun, until about eight, when the heat forces them to find shelter in the shady forests.",
    "\u201cIn the evening or morning it is easy to spot crawling serpents in the countryside. Some time ago I saw a white serpent, a rarity; I was taking aim with my gun, but a Hindu put his hand on my arm, preventing me from shooting because it was a sacred serpent. There is also a great quantity of wild cats of several sizes: some lurk in the trees, leaping from high onto the necks of passers-by. There are also many bears, leopards, and antelopes. The proprietor of the reserve where I went some time ago to hunt had ordered a boy to bring down something heavier: so, he killed an enormous crocodile.\u201d",
    "\u2018We listened with astonishment to the stories of the old man, since we had never imagined the woods and shrubs we had so admired from the ship could hide so many dangerous surprises.\u2019",
    "\u2018Meanwhile, Mrs. Roszkowska, Japanese by birth, brought us a Japanese delicacy, \u201cmochi\u201d (pastries made of rice flour) with \u201chashi\u201d (the chopsticks that Japanese use to eat). We greeted the lady and while we talked about religious matters regarding Japan, we ate some of those \u201cmochi,\u201d one of us two using the chopsticks, the other a fork.\u2019",
    "\u2018She thanked us in Japanese for Kishi, which pays her a visit every month. In this house, midway between the Polish Niepokalan\u00f3w and the Japanese one, Polish Rycerz meets with Japanese Kishi every month. Only in the local language, does the Knight still not exist\u2026 May the Immaculata guide everything.\u2019",

    "\u2018The Polish man and the Japanese lady said goodbye to us on the porch of the restaurant, while we left to make our way back to the harbor.\u2019",
    "\u2018On our way there, we entered the recently constructed church. It is absolutely beautiful and it is dedicated to the Blessed Mother. Then again to the bus. In the harbor zone, we come across our Polish crows-only they had forgotten how to croak.\u2019",
    "\u2018Immediately after, to the ship by motorboat. During the crossing, a Hindu, working as assistant on the boat, showed us some signs on the skin of his hand, which were supposed to mean that he belonged to the Catholic Church, and for this, he wanted\u2026 money. Poor con man, scrounger! These kinds were not lacking there either!\u2019",
    "\u2018At about six the ship moved out of the harbor, passing by the breakwater, pitching to the movement of the waves that hit uselessly against the barrier that prevented them from entering the harbor; foaming, they rose several meters high and broke and fell back into the sea, to rise immediately and hit again, and again, fall, breaking.\u2019",
    "\u2018The city lights grew fainter. Only the lighthouse still saluted us with its strong and intermittent streaks of light.\u2019",

    "When World War II broke out in 1939, St. Maximilian Kolbe was in charge of Niepokalan\u00f3w. The Nazis invaded Poland. According to the Nazi doctrine, the Poles were racially inferior to the Germans. In their invasion of Poland, Nazi forces launched mass killing operations against the Polish civilians and intelligentsia. Upon capturing Poland, the Nazis took over the Polish banks, businesses and properties. They forced about 1. 7 million Poles out of their homes. The Nazi forces soon took control of Niepokalan\u00f3w, and used it as a temporary internment camp for 3,500 Poles forcibly displaced by them.[ the photograph of the Nazi Officers which appeared in first part of this article in last Sunday\u2019 s issue of this newspaper was a photograph taken in front of Niepokalan\u00f3w].",
    "Nazis first arrested St. Maximillian Kolbe in September 1939, and released him in December, 1939. He refused to sign the Nazi declaration  Deutsche Volksliste, which would have granted him rights similar to those of German citizens. His family name \u2018 Kolbe \u2018 sounded German (though he was not an ethnic German), and he was fluent in the German language. Upon his release, St. Maximilian Kolbe resumed his work at his monastery at Niepokalan\u00f3w. He received limited permission from the Nazis to continue publishing religious literature, albeit on a significantly reduced scale.",
    "Some of the articles published in the publications of Niepokalan\u00f3w were critical of the Nazi regime and its activities. On February 17, 1941, St. Maximilian and four other friars were arrested. On May 28, 1941, they transferred him to Auschwitz as prisoner 16670, where he died on August 14, 1941 in the supremely heroic act of love and sacrifice to save the life of a fellow prisoner as we already read in the first few paragraphs of this article.",
    "His vision for India which also included Sri Lanka began to be realised 50 years later in 1980, when at the invitation of the Bishop of Kanjirappally (Syro-Malabar rite), OFM Conventual friars from Malta arrived in Kerala to establish the Order in India. At the 2007 General Chapter, the work of the mission in India was elevated to the administrative status of a Province (Province of St. Maximilian M. Kolbe in India). The work of the Province, in addition to its work in Kerala, today, comprises a Delegation in Andhrapradesh-Telengana (the Delegation of St. Joseph of Cupertino), a mission in Calcutta and another mission in Sri Lanka. Currently under its jurisdiction, there are 123 solemnly professed friars, 58 simply professed friars, 17 friaries and seven filial houses. In Sri Lanka, the Order of Friars Minor Convectual has four friaries in Katana, Battaramulla, Kandy and Jaffna and two Minor Seminaries.",
    "The Militia of the Immaculata which St. Maximilian, founded in 1917 with six other friars, has spread throughout the world. It is today present on five continents and in 46 nations with a membership of around four million. It received its first official approval from the Church in 1922. On October 16, 1997, the Holy See erected it as an International Public Association of the Faithful. The MI International Centre has its headquarters in Rome, Italy. Its membership is open to the clergy, consecrated and laity. Whilst prayer is its main weapon in the spiritual battle with evil, members of the Militia Immaculata \u2018also immerse themselves in apostolic initiatives throughout society, either individually or in groups, to deepen the knowledge of the Gospel and Christian Faith in them and in others.\u2019 St. Mother Teresa of Calcutta was among its notable Knights of the Immaculata (as its members are called)",
    "In Sri Lanka, there is one church consecrated to St. Maximilian Kolbe at Vishaka Watta in Ja Ela",
