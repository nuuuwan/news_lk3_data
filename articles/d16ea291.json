    "The Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Kanni Wignaraja, has met with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake this morning (14) at the Presidential Secretariat.",
    "The discussion primarily focused on governance, constitutional reforms, and the country\u2019s electoral system, according to the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) stated.",
    "The UNDP representative presented the report on \u201cUnderstanding Multidimensional Vulnerabilities: Impact on the People of Sri Lanka\u201d to President Dissanayake. Based on the findings of this report, the UNDP assured its support for Sri Lanka\u2019s development efforts.",
    "A key point of discussion was the low level of women\u2019s participation in the economy. The UNDP noted that rural women face significant challenges in financial literacy, limiting their involvement in economic activities.",
    "The farming sector, in particular, suffers from poor economic literacy, resulting in underrepresentation in the national economy. The UNDP expressed willingness to assist with digitalization programs, highlighting it as a critical tool to minimize corruption, the statement said.",
    "Discussing Sri Lanka\u2019s low agricultural productivity compared to other Asian nations, President Dissanayake explained that many farmers have small plots of land and do not view farming as their primary source of income. To address this, the government plans to strengthen farmers\u2019 associations, which would help improve bargaining power and agricultural activities, the PMD reported.",
    "Discussing reforms to the electoral system, President Dissanayake pointed out such reforms should ensure inclusive representation of ethnic and religious communities.",
    "Addressing concerns over the microfinance sector, the President explained the interests are unfair and that the current administration plans to establish a new development bank to support the microfinance sector, with a focus on greater involvement of women.",
    "The government also plans to provide Treasury guarantees for the best proposals submitted by women entrepreneurs to help them secure capital.",
    "The UNDP reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the government\u2019s reforms, anti-corruption efforts, and increasing women\u2019s participation in both the economy and Parliament, said the PMD.",
    "Resident Representative of the UNDP in Sri Lanka, Azusa Kubota, along with Team Leader for Strategic Engagement, Digital, and Innovation, Fadhil Bakeer Markar also participated in the discussion."
