  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Condominium Developers Association of Sri Lanka (CDASL) is deeply concerned about recent proposals advocating for protectionist measures within the tile industry. Furthermore, such proposals, if implemented without careful consideration, could have far-reaching consequences for both industry stakeholders and the general public.",
    "At the heart of the issue lies the lack of substantiated evidence supporting claims of \u201cdumping\u201d. Without concrete proof, such allegations raise suspicions regarding the motives behind them and the potential for unintended consequences. Moreover, the proposed measures overlook the detrimental effects of monopolistic practices, which have long plagued the housing, construction, and condominium industries in Sri Lanka.",
    "Monopolistic practices not only stifle competition but also stand in the way of innovation and quality advancements. By limiting consumer choice and exploiting market dominance, these practices drive up costs and erode trust in the industry. Furthermore, they hinder the growth and sustainability of the sector, further impeding progress and economic development.",
    "The escalating costs of tiles also pose significant challenges for construction projects, impacting affordability and accessibility of housing and commercial properties. This trend not only exacerbates financial strains on developers and contractors but also undermines the broader goals of social stability and economic growth. Affordable housing is essential for fostering inclusive communities and driving prosperity, making it crucial to address the root causes of high costs.",
    "In light of these concerns, the CDASL urges a balanced approach to policymaking\u2014one that considers the interests of both consumers and local manufacturers. While protecting domestic industries is important, it must not come at the expense of consumer welfare or market fairness. Any proposed measures should be evidence-based and transparent, with a clear understanding of their potential impacts on industry dynamics and consumer choice.",
