    "It is true that in the distant past Sri Lankan elections were emotionally charged affairs resulting in violence. However, as a battle-hardened nation with an increasingly well-informed citizenry, that trend has changed for the better. For example, Sri Lanka 2022 Human Right report stated, \u201cDomestic observers described the election as peaceful, technically well managed, and safe considering the COVID-19 pandemic but noted that unregulated campaign spending, abuse of state resources, and media bias affected the level playing field,\u201d referring to the 2020 election. As of this writing, the Election Commission has reported a 43% drop in violations in the current cycle with eleven instances of violence. Even though no violations can be accepted, this is a promising trend, people are beginning to see through the heinous intentions of the perpetrators. One would expect that trend to continue and, judging by the low-key election fervor, which appears to be the case.",
    "However, the media, especially the internet, is awash with predictions of doom and gloom in the aftermath of the election. Why do they do so, are there underlying reasons for that? Obviously, a bulk of them are based on computer generated fake news: fake medical bills and Rs. 10,000 notes are just two examples. It should not be underestimated how sophisticated AI technology has become in generating true to life images and voices. Considering the unlimited freedom the internet enjoys, and the limited capabilities of fact checking, the public must take such sensational news with a proverbial grain of salt.",
    "On the other hand, there were several newspaper articles written by \u2018regular\u2019 analysts predicting that there are underlying reasons to expect violence. If you investigate their past, it becomes clear that they are projecting their distant experience to today\u2019s world. They tend to go further by admonishing the young for not knowing the history. It is unfortunate that they fail to consider the psyche of the modern Sri Lankan society, particularly that of the youth: we have come a long way, if in doubt, review how the aragalaya went, state sponsored violence aside. We are not a bunch of primitive tribesmen fighting for a putrid carcass, as the naysayers would like to think. However, it is in our hands, and to our interest, to act intelligently, banish those ghosts from the past, and prove the naysayers are wrong. The role of the country\u2019s judicial system in restoring civility is of enormous significance lately. It is a tragedy that it was held hostage for so long, allowing individuals to take law into their hands.",
    "Obviously, only one person will be elected; however, as it is the people\u2019s will, expressed based on the democratic system we relish, it is our civic duty to act in the interest of the nation. The interest of the entire nation, not that of an individual, particular tribe, social class, or the supporters of one political party. The change we demand is to provide an equal playing field for everyone \u2013 we the people, to participate in the country\u2019s economy, and not just a privileged few, as is happening now in violation of existing laws and norms. That is a human right, and demanding it is not a threat to anyone. Unless someone is breaking the law.",
    "Let us recall what Wincent Churchill said about governance \u201cMany forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\u2026\u201d Therefore, we must go with the people\u2019s choice and give the best chance for it to work. However, we must make sure that the parliamentary system endures and that there is no chance for an autocracy on this land.",
    "We, as a country, have a history of missed opportunities. In all past missed occasions, the driving force has been the ego or self-interests, whether it is of a ruler or a majority population, instead of the wisdom to do the right thing for the country. Those who gained privileges by undemocratic means will lose some of such benefits, and they will try to break the law. But it is not the time to let our emotions rule our actions; revenge, jealousy, or greed have no place. No one should take the law into their hands. Our salvation depends on our devotion to the common goal of restoring the economy and giving everyone an equal opportunity to participate in it, regardless of all other human-caused divisions. Violence or sabotage of any form will only take us back to the dark ages as they will further deplete our merger resources. And if that happens, not only it is an insult to our collective intelligence, but that will also prolong our collective misery.",
