(AP) — Hunter Biden was convicted Tuesday of all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018 when, prosecutors argued, the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.

Hunter Biden, 54, stared straight ahead and showed little emotion as the verdict was read after jury deliberations that lasted only three hours over two days in Wilmington, Delaware. He hugged his attorneys, smiled wanly and kissed his wife, Melissa, before leaving the courtroom with her.

President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict that he would accept the outcome and “continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.”

Now Hunter Biden and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the president’s chief political rival, have both been convicted by American jurors in an election year that has been as much about the courtroom as about campaign events and rallies.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s (AKD) speech as the Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) at the National Convention organized by the Retired Police Officers Collective on 9 June 2024 is quite promising in terms of establishing or reestablishing rule of law in the country, if they get the opportunity to govern the nation. They have been talking about a ‘system change’ now for some time, and various independent critics and observers were asking the details of this promise, without merely depending on the slogan.

I was fortunate to listen to this speech online and live, through ‘Horawa News,’ and one weakness or wrong that I immediately observed was its leading phrase ‘Malimawa shows its police power.’ I have no idea about who runs the ‘Horawa,’ but that was not what AKD was quite obviously advocating. “Power’ is not a good word to use in democracy, worst still is the ‘police power.’

### Could you believe crabs killing giant guitarfish?

Guitarfish, also known as shovelnose rays, are a species of ray that are named because of their guitar-shaped bodies. They belong to the order Rhinopristiformes, along with the wedgefish and sawfish. This group are also called shark-like rays due to their flattened body with pectoral fins fused to the sides of the head and a hind body that resembles a shark, with two dorsal fins and a caudal fin.

The Rhinopristiformes exhibit slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, like many other rays and sharks. Such characteristics, alone or in combination, make fishes in this group vulnerable to extinction. The global IUCN Red List of threatened species reveals that species in the order Rhinopristiformes are amongst the most threatened marine fishes and over 70% of guitarfish are either threatened or data deficient.

### The many faces of impunity

*2024-06-12 00:32:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-many-faces-of-impunity/4-762932) · `en`

Such impunity is possible because an absolute majority of victims are the most discriminated against people in Sri Lanka: Upcountry Tamils

Ten years: that was how long three State institutions didn’t pay EPF and ETF monies to their retired and deceased employees.

Most victims of this act of criminal injustice suffered and died in silence. A few (about 2,000) filed court cases. The larger society, including the media, political parties and the labour movement, didn’t know, didn’t care.

This injustice happened in the only place it could have been perpetrated with legal, political, and societal impunity: the plantation sector. The culprits were the three State-owned plantation companies. The excuse was that these companies made losses. How many state-owned enterprises make profits? Do the loss-making ones (which include CEB, CPC, and Air Lanka) deny their employees EPF and ETF payments? What would happen if they even tried?

### On system change

*2024-06-12 00:20:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/On-system-change/4-762931) · `en`

“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has”

It was only after the 2022 Aragalaya that the need for system change was felt among different quarters of Sri Lanka’s intelligentsia and opinion makers. In his Independence Day address to the nation even President RW casually referred to system change without any elaboration. One or two outspoken members from the opposition parties also, without much details, described the shortcomings of current administration as systemic. But it was NPP that adopted system change as its central pillar of reforms if it were to come to power.

### Sri Lanka to promote sea cucumber hatcheries due to demand: Minister

*2024-06-11 19:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-promote-sea-cucumber-hatcheries-due-to-demand-minister-167502/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will establish more sea cucumber hatcheries to accommodate growing demand for the marine animal in the export market, Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda said.

“There are three hatcheries established in Jaffna peninsula. Very soon we will establish in the other areas,” Devananda told reporters on Tuesday.

“They are like black gold,” Devananda said. There are “a lot of farms, especially in the Northern Province. We are getting foreign exchange too.”

The invertebrate found on the sea floor is not commonly consumed by Sri Lankans, so they are being exported to countries like China, Devananda said.

“Sea cucumber, especially our people, they are not eating, it is in China, they are eating.”

Last year the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources told EconomyNext that a kilo of sea cucumber is valued at 20,000-30,000 rupees.

Devananda proposed the establishment of hatcheries as an alternative to catching wild sea cucumbers. (Colombo/Jun11/2024)
