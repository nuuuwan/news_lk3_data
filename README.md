ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has to avoid ‘stop-go’ (boom-bust) cycles involving unsustainable monetary and fiscal stimulus that lead to crises, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana has said after Fitch upgraded Sri Lanka from default status.

Sri Lanka completed a restructuring of sovereign bonds on December 20, and the country was classified as CCC+, 5 levels above restructured default.

“All the hard work and sacrifice, particularly by the people of Sri Lanka, has now paid off and Sri Lanka has the opportunity for a fresh start in the New Year,” Siriwardana said in an x.com post.

“However, this growth cannot come at he expense of economic stability,” Siriwardana said.

“All too often in the past, whenever the economy has stabilized following a shock, we are too eager to provide unsustainable fiscal and monetary stimulus to re-invigorate growth.

“The result is a rapid return to instability – which has characterized several stop-go cycles in Sri Lanka’s post-independence economic history.”

Leftist Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.

Analysts had warned that it could lead to a credit shock being accommodated by the central bank with negative consequences on the exchange rate, which is in any case under an inconsistent policy.

Sri Lankan Pres. Dissanayake's India visit focuses on economic aid, trade cooperation, security assurances, BRICS membership, Tamil rights, and fisheries disputes. Key: no use of Sri Lankan land against India, support for Tamil aspirations, and resolving fishermen conflicts.

🟩

There were two reasons why President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India and his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gained much importance in the media.

The first is the leader of a party that was one of his major policies of Indian opposition. They had long traveled with that policy. It is through it that the party strengthened.

The second, his JVP. Was identified as a Chinese pro organization. The reflection of the Chinese Tutu in Colombo on the victory of the National People's Power in the general election also strengthened this view.

During his visit to New Delhi, President Dissanayake revealed the most relaxed diplomacy in the wake of the intensification of Sri Lanka -based Chinese -Indian power competition.

The attitude of Dissanayake was seen as the one who accepted the importance of India in the South Asian region. That is, the history of the JVP in the past has been confirmed during this visit that the President is changing the severe course of India.
