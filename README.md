Makes it clear URF will not contest the election alone, in alliance with the SJB, or with any other party

Claims dispute centres around violation of the MoU concerning district candidates and not national list slots

Former Member of Parliament Patali Champika Ranawaka announced yesterday that his party, the United Republic Front (URF), will not contest the 2024 Parliamentary Election. Ranawaka shared this decision during a press briefing held at the URF headquarters citing a breach of agreement with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) as the reason for withdrawal.

According to Ranawaka, the URF entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the SJB in August 2023, with the expectation that URF candidates would be fielded in 11 districts in the upcoming general election. However, he claimed that the SJB had unilaterally violated the MoU, prompting his party to withdraw from the election process altogether.

The need for proactive intelligence to prevent incidents like the Easter Sunday attacks cannot be overstated

witness that men, consciously—that is, fully understanding their real interests—have left them in the background and rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness.

Given the recent political changes the country has experienced, the writer senses a need to reproduce this article (which was published previously). At a time when the track record and performance of the country’s intelligence services and law enforcement agencies have been debated in the public sphere, and with the appointment of a new Chief of State Intelligence, the writer feels it is pertinent to re-examine this interesting, albeit somewhat “murky,” subject.
