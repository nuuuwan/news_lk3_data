    "In an incredibly silly switcheroo, Sajith and the SJB, hijacked or converted by an elitist cosmopolitan caucus, tried to play the UNP of 1977 rather than either of the two roles that were required by a democratic Opposition with a strong Left competitor. These were roles customised for Sajith and the SJB to play: SWRD 1956, Ranasinghe Premadasa 1988 or both. The SJB abjured these roles, abdicating them to their rival Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP. AKD kicked the goal in",
    "Neither President Dissanayake nor Foreign Minister Herath will attend the BRICS summit in Russia, Oct 22-24. The skimpy reason given was electioneering. https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-president-foreign-minister-to-skip-brics-summit-183475/",
    "Putin sent a letter of invitation through his ambassador. AKD has won his election and can surely spare a few days. His appearance at the BRICS summit would reinforce our bid for membership (initiated by Foreign Minister Sabry) while enhancing the JVP-NPP\u2019s electoral profile. Alternatively, PM Amarasuriya could attend the opening, Foreign Minister Herath the closing, splitting-up the few conference days.",
    "Why forfeit this golden opportunity to project the new government to the BRICS, take its place among leaders like Brazil\u2019s Lula, make friends, explore options of diversifying dependence, share views on debt restructuring, balance our external relations, and identify with \u2018BRICS Plus\u2019 and its global perspective?",
    "The Lankan political leadership\u2019s absence from the BRICS summit; the alacrity with which AKD agreed to Ranil\u2019s framework with the ISB holders; the appointment of CITIBANK as intermediary (rather than, say, Prof Martin Guzman, former Finance Minister of Argentina); the Indian media report that the Ranil-Modi road-rail project linking Trincomalee with Tamil Nadu is moving ahead; the \u2018crony communist-capitalist\u2019 state appointments -- all point to the core character and trajectory of the AKD administration.",
    "The new administration wants the West and India on-side while establishing \u201cstrong political power\u201d (AKD to his candidates) \u2013i.e., complete control-- on the island.",
    "I relate reflexively to the red flag with the hammer-and-sickle. I stood up straighter seeing the flag on screen at the recent reception for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
    "At the Museum of the Revolution in Beijing, I teared-up in the corner of an eye when I saw the black-and white footage of Mao on horseback.",
    "As a 15-year-old, I had a lump in my throat when Richard Burton playing Marshal Tito in the movie \u2018Sutjeska\u2019 (1973) called out \u2018Communists step forward\u2019 for a suicidally dangerous anti-Nazi battle (in 1943) and nobody did, though one man spoke for everyone: \u201cComrade Tito, we are all Communists here\u201d.",
    "On President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s delegation on the first official visit by a Sri Lankan head of state to Vietnam (late-2009), MR observed me raising a clenched-fist salute at the glass case enclosing the body of Ho Chi Minh.",
    "I am proud of being quoted on revolutionary ethics (from my book on Fidel) in a review in Radical Philosophy (UK) of Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s two-part biopic on Che Guevara starring Benecio del Toro.",
    "All that said, I didn\u2019t like it when the NPP candidates trooped over to the JVP headquarters in Pelawatta with the red flag emblazoned with hammer-and-sickle fluttering outside the building in the stiff, pre-rain breeze.",
    "This was very different from seeing the same red flag flying over the coalition government of Communist and left parties in Kerala.",
    "Here was a mask dropped, revealing a political subterfuge and the shape of things to come.",
    "The NPP is supposedly a socialist national political movement, not a Marxist-Leninist or Communist one. This is doubtless true. What it covered up so far was the real relationship between the NPP and the JVP.",
    "\u201c\u2026News footage showed National People\u2019s Power (NPP) or Jathika Jana Balavegaya General Secretary Dr Abeykoon and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna\u00a0 (JVP) Secretary Tilvin Silva seated in front of a large flag emblazoned by a hammer and sickle watching would-be candidates signing nomination papers.\u201d (https://www.sundaytimes.lk/241013/columns/jvpnpp-target-house-next-aim-for-at-least-a-simple-if-not-large-majority-574242.html)",
    "NPP candidates went to the JVP headquarters to sign their nominations. NPP General Secretary Dr Nihal Abeysinghe, who is also a senior member of JVP leadership, scrutinised the paperwork. He then handed the paperwork over to the man at whose left hand he sat, the ultimate authority for perusal and final approval. That was Tilvin Silva, General Secretary of the JVP, and executive committee member of the NPP (JJB). At the end of the process, when the media posed questions, it was comrade Tilvin, not NPP Gen Secretary Dr Abeysinghe answering on the steps of the JVP office.",
    "The NPP is revealed as a \u2018front organisation\u2019 of left-liberal \u2018fellow travellers\u2019 of the JVP. The JVP is in control of the NPP. The JVP\u2019s hierarchy is in control of the JVP, therefore the NPP.",
    "A vote for the NPP is a vote for the JVP. A two-thirds majority for the NPP would be a two-thirds majority for the JVP. The JVP would become the decider, controlling the country, the state, and ultimately, society.",
    "If the JVP-NPP wins a simple majority, it would be a beneficial experiment and experience which will help society reform and the JVP evolve.",
    "In contradistinction, a two-thirds or anything that could bring it within reach poses an unacceptable risk to pluralist democracy.",
    "Therefore, it is strategically imperative to contain and constrain the JVP.",
    "What we have is a generational revolution. We also have an ideological revolution. For the first time, we have a leader who doesn\u2019t only have a left background and orientation --as did Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga-- but is the leader of an avowedly Marxist-Leninist party, the JVP. What we do NOT have is the country\u2019s first non-elite leader",
    "At the beginning of this election year, I called attention to the fact that we have a chance to make a generational transition in the island\u2019s political leadership; to shift the generational tectonic plates. That was because we had a choice to two candidates in their mid-50s and one in his mid-70s. I argued we should delete the one in his mid-70s and pick one of the two in their 50s.",
    "We also have an ideological revolution. For the first time, we have a leader who doesn\u2019t only have a left background and orientation --as did Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga-- but is the leader of an avowedly Marxist-Leninist party, the JVP.",
    "What we do NOT have is the country\u2019s first non-elite leader.",
    "I was browsing the compact anthology of my father\u2019s published writings, \u2018Crisis Commentaries\u2019 (ICES Colombo, Introduction by Radhika Coomaraswamy) when I came upon pieces with captions such as:",
    "The reference was to the victory of Ranasinghe Premadasa. Anura Dissanayake broke through a class barrier which had already been broken once but had been restored. However, AKD comes from the so-called \u2018upper caste\u2019. By contrast, Ranasinghe Premadasa broke through the strongest of barriers in South Asian society and politics: class and caste, or as sociologists call it, \u2018class-caste\u2019.",
    "\u2018The crowning achievement of Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s 30-year political career has been a major sociological breakthrough for the Sri Lankan system.",
    "Even before Independence in 1948, the island\u2019s political establishment was totally dominated by an exclusive caste-and-class \u2018set\u2019\u2026Mr. Premadasa has now broken that monopoly. He is a genuine commoner.",
    "\u2026Mr. Premadasa, who had come up from very humble beginnings to become the candidate of the rich man\u2019s UNP, presented himself as \u201cthe common man\u201d. He understood, he said, the needs and hopes of the poor and the underprivileged. He did not steal the clothes of the 1956 \u2018revolution\u2019. He was already wearing them from childhood.",
    "\u2026Mr. Premadasa, the small man\u2019s president, symbolizes the partial and temporary success of 1956.\u2019",
    "(Mervyn de Silva, \u2018Dominance of Elite Ends\u2019, the Deccan Herald, India, Dec 29th 1988)",
    "\u2018President Premadasa is the first elected leader from outside the ranks of the Goigama (farmer) caste... Like Tamils, Muslims and Christians, representative personalities from the so-called \u2018lower castes\u2019 have always been accommodated by the main political parties. But never has a non-Goigama member from the \u2018lower castes\u2019 become leader of a major party, let alone Prime Minister or President.",
    "In this semi-feudal society where traditional stratification tends to associate institutionalized oppression with caste, which is unalterable, rather than class, Mr. Premadasa\u2019s election as presidential candidate of the conservative UNP was a sociological breakthrough.",
    "\u2026Having used him, the upper-class and westernized elite are now determined to recover their lost hegemony by dumping him, he protests\u2026Mr. Premadasa spends four-five days a week addressing island-wide rallies to charge the English-educated upper class, including the Bandaranaike led Opposition, of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d against \u201cthe man of the people\u201d, the \u201coutsider\u201d, the \u201cupstart\u201d \u2026\u2019",
    "(\u2018\u201cOutsider\u201d Takes on Elite\u2019, Mervyn de Silva, Times of India, 1989)",
    "Many commentators, academics, intellectuals and civil society figures who support Anura Kumara Dissanayake today as a \u2018non-elite\u2019 breakthrough, vilified Premadasa as President and even PM. Alone among the Marxist intelligentsia, Susil Sirivardhana, Simon Navagattegama and I supported him (in my case, barely surviving a lynch-mob at Kanatte, August 1992).",
    "Whatever claims that Sajith and the SJB make for themselves as an economic team, they have proved themselves vastly inferior to the JVP and its extension/auxiliary the NPP as a political team. The SJB thought an election is an Economics exam, and flunked the Politics paper, leaving AKD-NPP managing the economy.",
    "For the first time in our post-Independence history a mainstream democratic party has been proved politically inferior to the Marxist Left in general and the JVP in particular, and that puts the entire democratic system in jeopardy.",
    "The most incisive political analysis in the Sinhala-language media of Anura\u2019s historic victory and Sajith\u2019s avoidable defeat was entitled \u201cAnura Did a Ranasinghe Premadasa While Sajith Had Been Dressed-Up to Play JR\u201d. Remarkably, it was a signed political commentary in the Mawrata, a newspaper sympathetic to Sajith and the SJB, by veteran political columnist Upul Joseph Fernando (formerly of the Lankadeepa Editorial Desk).",
    "It pointed out acerbically that in a post-Aragalaya Sri Lanka with a tsunami of public sentiment against the old bipartisan elitist Establishment which had plunged the country into crisis, Anura Dissanayake stepped forward to play the anti-elite \u2018Outsider\u2019 role of Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1988, while Premadasa\u2019s son Sajith who could have easily done so was manipulated by the SJB\u2019s elite into playing an \u2018Insider\u2019, auditioning for JR Jayewardene in 1977,\u00a0 mounting a candidacy which claimed that the SJB could partner the IMF better, instead of fulfilling Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s promise of a New Deal-- a more just, fairer society. The Mawrata also named the elitist SJB ideological and policy \u2018twins\u2019 who tripped Sajith up.",
    "What gives Upul Joseph\u2019s presidential election post-mortem credibility is the fact that after the August 2020 General Election the Mawrata had showcased the fledgling SJB\u2019s achievement and sketched an accurate roadmap and path to victory for Sajith and his party in 2024.",
    "Mawrata which has two respected senior journalists running it, Upul Joseph Fernando and Thushara Gunaratna, asserted after August 2020 that Sajith\u2019s SJB was in exactly the same situation as SWRD Bandaranaike\u2019s SLFP, which had been founded in 1951 and faced its first election in 1952. They pointed out that the SJB had bettered the SLFP\u2019s performance. While the SLFP had secured 15% on its first outing, the SJB had 23%. It also had 53 seats which was a larger chunk than the SLFP had. Both SWRD Bandaranaike and Sajith Premadasa had assumed the post of Opposition Leader after their first General Election.",
    "In August 2020, the JVP running as its new avatar the NPP had just 3 seats. AKD had scored 3% in November 2019 while Sajith had clocked 42%.",
    "At the very next General Election the new party, the SLFP faced, SWRD Bandaranaike was elected Prime Minister and formed the government. The new centrist-progressive formation had spearheaded a Silent Revolution, cannily overtaking the powerful Left which had led the Hartal 1953 uprising. The road was clear for Sajith and the SJB to win the Presidency and Parliament in 2024, said the Mawrata.",
    "In an incredibly silly switcheroo, Sajith and the SJB, hijacked or converted by an elitist cosmopolitan caucus, tried to play the UNP of 1977 rather than either of the two roles that were required by a democratic Opposition with a strong Left competitor. These were roles customised for Sajith and the SJB to play: SWRD 1956, Ranasinghe Premadasa 1988 or both. The SJB abjured these roles, abdicating them to their rival Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP. AKD kicked the goal in.",
    "The SJB\u2019s rightwing ideologues were/are politically ignorant. None had worked with a UNP leader who won the presidency. No one in the SJB except for Imtiaz Bakeer Markar, knew the metamorphosis the UNP had consciously undertaken in Opposition in 1973-1977, which enabled the 1977 victory.",
    "Writing in the Lanka Guardian magazine in 1980, Minister Lalith Athulathmudali (no fan of then Prime Minister R. Premadasa), disclosed the party\u2019s drastic transformation while in the Opposition and the decisive role of Premadasa in that process.",
    "\u201c\u2026 It [the UNP] had to change its image in theory and in practice. It had to stand on the side of the underprivileged; it had to provide answers to their problems. The one-rupee membership campaign not only changed the money sources of the party but it also helped to democratize its internal politics.",
    "A new policy and programme proposed by a Committee headed by R. Premadasa was adopted.",
    "Family power and privileged group power were dethroned and the fact that these very monstrosities were being strengthened in the other parties only served to consolidate the UNP.",
    "In the popular mind the UNP often thought of as being concerned with the few, came to be considered as the party of the masses. The UNP had built itself a new political base\u201d.",
    "(Lalith Athulathmudali, Lanka Guardian, Vol. 2 No 17, 1980 p13-14).",
    "This was diametrically opposite to the social and ideological direction pushed by the SJB\u2019s rightwing from 2020 to date.",
    "When Sajith and Harsha de Silva visited Ronnie de Mel the architect of JR\u2019s Open Economy on his 91st birthday, he advised them (on camera), to \u201crevive the Open Economy, infusing it with a strong dose of socialist values\u201d. Harsha-Eran-Kabir ignored Ronnie\u2019s advice just as they had ignored Nobel Prize winner Joe Stiglitz\u2019 advice tendered to Ranil in Colombo in 2015, and preferred notorious neoliberal Ricardo Hausmann instead.",
    "Sajith\u2019s \u2018Social Democracy\u2019 was drowned out by Harsha\u2019s \u2018Social Market Economy\u2019 borrowed from Ranil, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the rightwing International Democratic Union.",
    "Parties more renowned than the SJB have been sunk by surrender on the part of leaders more experienced than Sajith, to rightwing ideological caucuses. Senator John McCain\u2019s presidential run (2008) was dead in the water when he capitulated to the insistence of the US Republican party\u2019s Tea Party Movement i.e., the Christian fundamentalist Evangelical Right, to accept Sarah Palin as Vice-Presidential candidate.",
    "That was politico-electoral suicide at time when the American public reeling from the Great Recession (2008) and Hurricane Katrina (2005), sought progressive change (which Obama represented). Similarly, Sajith and the SJB\u2019s debacle, 2022-2024.",
    "If Harsha de Silva leads the SJB, it won\u2019t win any rural areas beating the JVP-NPP. With Sajith, the SJB did (e.g., Medawachchiya, Harispattuwa). If SP course-corrects, he could counterbalance the JVP.",
    "Can the Opposition curtail, contain and countervail the JVP? Whatever claims that Sajith and the SJB make for themselves as an economic team, they have proved themselves vastly inferior to the JVP and its extension/auxiliary the NPP as a political team. The SJB thought an election is an Economics exam, and flunked the Politics paper, leaving AKD-NPP managing the economy. For the first time in our post-Independence history a mainstream democratic party has been proved politically inferior to the Marxist Left in general and the JVP in particular, and that puts the entire democratic system in jeopardy",
    "November 13th 2024 marks the 35th anniversary of the defeat of the JVP\u2019s second insurrection and its leader\u2019s demise.",
    "Or can Sajith finally channel the electoral spirit of his father who saved pluralist democracy 35 years ago, and contain and countervail the JVP Leviathan?"
