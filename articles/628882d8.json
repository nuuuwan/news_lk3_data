    "Gamer.LK, Sri Lanka\u2019s premier Video Games and Esports company, was recognised once again at the SLIM DIGIS 2.5 Awards, winning the Gold Award in the Gaming, Gamification & Esports category at the 2025 edition.",
    "The Gold Award was presented for the campaign \u201cNDB Avurudu Dupatha\u201d, produced by Gamer.LK for National Development Bank PLC (NDB). Presented under the Gaming, Gamification & Esports category, which honours campaigns that leverage gamified experiences and the wider gaming ecosystem, the accolade highlights how Gamer.LK successfully engaged a hard-to-reach digital audience through interactive gaming content. Joining the campaign, Manitha \u201cManiya\u201d Abeysiriwardena, Sadun \u201cGaming Sadu\u201d Dilakshan and 16 other streamers from Gamer.LK\u2019s streamer network live-streamed the story-based campaign to their audiences. By tapping into authentic gaming culture and delivering measurable engagement for the brand, the \u201cNDB Avurudu Dupatha\u201d set a benchmark for how video games and gamification can be effectively integrated into mainstream marketing.",
    "Gamer.LK also conceptualised and executed the campaign \u201cClean Up Mr. Claws\u201d for CLEAR by Unilever Sri Lanka., which received a Merit Award at this year\u2019s SLIM DIGIS. The campaign transformed the usual 30-second cinema advertisement sit-through into a gamified experience, allowing audiences to interact with the content rather than passively watch. By merging entertainment with brand messaging, the activation created a unique connection with movie-goers, leaving a lasting impression while delivering tangible engagement results.",
    "The SLIM DIGIS Awards are organised annually by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) and celebrate excellence in digital marketing by recognising the most innovative and effective campaigns across industries.",
    "Commenting on the recognition, Raveen Wijayatilake, Founder of Gamer.LK and CEO of InGame Esports said: \u201cThese awards once again demonstrate the strength of Gaming and Esports as a credible and effective marketing channel in Sri Lanka. Over the past decade, Gamer.LK has grown into an international Esports and video gaming agency, executing campaigns across multiple regions of the world. While our global footprint continues to expand, it is especially rewarding to partner with leading Sri Lankan brands and be recognised for the work in our home market.\u201d",
    "With these wins, Gamer.LK continues to reinforce its position as a pioneer in Gaming, Gamification and Esports-driven marketing. Over the years, the agency has been recognised at the SLIM DIGIS with multiple Awards, including the coveted Grand Prix Gold Award, further underscoring its track record of delivering impactful, innovative campaigns that connect brands with audiences in meaningful ways.",
