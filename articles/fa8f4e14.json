  "original_body_lines": [
    "A twelve-month long participatory policy-making project between policymakers and marginalised groups in Bhutan, resulted in a better understanding of each other\u2019s roles, identifying gaps and building empathy.",
    "The project titled Democracy Beyond Borders, which ended in 2023, encouraged engagement and collaboration between the two groups and focussed on better social protections for the marginalised, explained Dr Chencho Lhamu, Dean of Development and External Relations, Royal Thimpu College.",
    "Dr Lhamu told a web talk on Citizen Participation and Engagement in Bhutan that policymakers usually regard their area of work as their exclusive domain.",
    "The project\u2019s evaluation report indicated that government officials expressed a better understanding of the gaps in services available to the marginalised groups, which included women, people with disabilities and vulnerable youth.",
    "Meanwhile, a high percentage of the participants too had stated that the outcomes were an impetus to be actively engaged in influencing policymakers.  It had also created awareness and empathy among the marginalised groups.",
    "The web talk organised by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation South Asia, on November 13, 2024, included the Hon Tshering Tshomo, MP, National Council of Bhutan, Kinley Tshering, Managing Editor, Keunsel, and Karma Dupchen, Environmental, Social and Governance Specialist, Bhutanese Dysphoria in Germany as panelists and was moderated by former MP and Parliament Expert, Sangay Khandu.",
    "Citizen engagement is a fundamental pillar of democracy, and it contributes to shaping policies, stated Hon Tshering Tshomo.",
    "It must not, she added, be limited to elections but must become part of the direct and indirect national discourse.",
    "Bhutanese have a deep sense of community, where respect and cooperation are deep-rooted and considered a right and a responsibility she said, adding therefore, that public hearings are an important instrument.",
    "Meanwhile, in Bhutan, like elsewhere in the world, social media has changed the media ecosystem and public discourse explained Kinley Tshering.",
    "Though vibrant and critical, its dark side of spreading hatred and character assassination has resulted in mainstream media playing the role of verifier of the disinformation and misinformation that is spread.",
    "This also means there is much to be done in the area of media literacy, especially around social media he pointed out.",
    "Dr Lhamu agreed that there\u2019s much to be desired in that sector, and added that those mostly engaging in social media are young and lack the depth and understanding of issues facing the country.",
    "Often, theirs is a knee-jerk reaction rather than well-thought-out responses.",
    "That\u2019s a commentary on the educational system, which, she said focuses on classroom learning instead of including current issues and critical thinking.",
    "Tshering Tshomo countered that the Ministry of Education and Skills Development was taking media literacy seriously, a factor included in its five-year plan.",
    "Kinley Tshering also pointed out that economic issues resulted in the closure of many media enterprises.",
    "The current landscape, therefore, is urban centred he pointed out with little or no coverage from rural areas.",
    "Heavy dependency on government advertisements also prevents the media from being as vibrant as it should be.",
    "Karma Dupchen meanwhile pointed to the importance of leveraging technology to encourage citizen engagement.",
    "Bhutanese, he opined are not open enough to critical, balanced discussions which would lead to robust solutions.",
    "The young seem to be more invested in global politics, but reluctant to be objective and question local affairs.",
    "That is also apparent when new ideas and innovations are introduced, he added.",
    "However, development should not come at the cost of Bhutan\u2019s values, he cautioned, citing tourism as an example.",
    "Though mass tourism and opening up to foreign investors would boost the economy, it would negatively impact smaller local businesses, he added.",
    "Referring to the requirement of an Endowment Fund for all registered Civil Society Organisations (minimum Nu 3 million, equivalent to US$ 35,520.90) introduced by the Civil Society Organisations Authority, Dr Lhamu pointed out that such a mandatory requirement negatively impacts CSOs, which, she explained, emerge when there is a need and don\u2019t always become permanent entities.",
    "Good communication is fundamental in a functioning democracy, stated Dasho Karma Ura, President, Centre of Bhutan & GNH Studies in his keynote address.",
    "He added that good governance is built on trust between the State and civil society.",
    "In Bhutan, the idea of community is defined not as an entity registered by the State and the singular application of the law, but by their customs, and common ownership of property and facilities, he explained.",
    "Reinhard Wolf- President, Bhutan German Himalaya Gesellschaft and Moritz Korner, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany and a Member of the European Parliament also addressed the web talk."
