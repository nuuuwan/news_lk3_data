### Israel and Hamas signal resistance to ending Gaza war after Sinwar’s death

*2024-10-19 08:03:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102788/israel-and-hamas-signal-resistance-to-ending-gaza-war-after-sinwars-death) · `en`

Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza and reiterated its stance that hostages the militant group took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops.

The group’s staunch position pushed back against a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin a day earlier that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming.

The conflicting stands signal continued deep resistance on both sides to ending the war, even as President Joe Biden and other world leaders press the case that Sinwar’s death is a turning point that should be used to unlock stalled cease-fire negotiations.

### Does President AKD Borrow Money Like Ex-Prez Ranil?

“Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education” ~ Stephen Covey

Recent bitter criticisms by some opposition ex-parliamentarians regarding government borrowing (i.e., President Anura Kumara Dissanayake) have no substance; it is for mudslinging and due to ignorance of the subject matter. President AKD is performing his mandatory work responsibilities as the Minister of Finance, similar to ex-Prez Ranil Wickremesinghe. Borrowing by President AKD has no burden on the total debt or Debt to GDP as per the IMF Program. Payment to pensioners, fertilizer, and fuel subsidies are within the fiscal space. No funds have been borrowed and wasted at all. Fertilizer and fuel subsidies greatly benefit the economy in numerous ways. Given the recent meeting by President AKD with the agricultural officials, formulating a National Agricultural Policy and having a public discussion on the same is a top priority of the government in the right direction.
