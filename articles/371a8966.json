    "The mid-strength Typhoon Podul, packing wind gusts as strong as 191 kph (118 mph), was heading for the southeastern city of Taitung as it intensifies and was expected to make landfall nearby on Wednesday afternoon, weather officials said.",
    "\u201cDestructive winds from typhoon expected. Take shelter as soon as possible,\u201d read a text message alert issued to cellphone users in parts of Taitung early on Wednesday. The alert warned people of gusts above 150 kph (93 mph) in the coming hours.",
    "Nine cities and counties announced the suspension of work and school for Wednesday, including the southern metropolises of Kaohsiung and Tainan. In the capital Taipei, home to Taiwan\u2019s financial markets, there was no impact.",
    "Authorities are also working to evacuate those whose homes were damaged by a July typhoon that brought record winds and damaged the electricity grid in a rare direct hit to Taiwan\u2019s west coast.",

    "Taiwan\u2019s two main international carriers China Airlines\u00a0 and EVA Air\u00a0 said their cancellations were focused in routes out of Kaohsiung, with some flights from the island\u2019s main international airport at Taoyuan stopped as well.",
    "After making landfall, the storm is expected to hit Taiwan\u2019s much more densely populated western coast before heading for China\u2019s southern province of Fujian later this week.",
    "As much as 600 mm (24 inches) of rain was forecast in southern mountainous areas over the next few days, the Central Weather Administration said.",
    "More than a year\u2019s rainfall fell in a single week this month in some southern areas, unleashing widespread landslides and flooding, with four deaths."
