    "\u201cWith our steadfast commitment towards addressing plastic pollution in Sri Lanka, we take continuous action to make our plastic packaging recyclable or reusable and strengthen segregation and collection of waste, whilst inspiring a positive behavioural change. An important initiative in this journey is the School Waste Management Programme which strives to instil good habits in the future generation of Sri Lanka, ensuring the sustainable development of the country. In this light, we were delighted to help organize this Art Competition, which not only served as a platform for showcasing the creative skills of budding artists, but also helped reinforce the importance of taking action towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow.
