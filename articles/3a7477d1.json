    "Seeks progress on addressing 14,988 complaints filed with the Office on Missing Persons",
    "The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances will review Sri Lanka on Friday, 26 September, in Geneva. The review will take place in two sessions, from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time, and will be broadcast live on UNTV.",
    "During the public dialogue, the Committee is expected to question the Sri Lankan delegation on a range of issues raised in its \u2018List of Issues\u2019, which followed the Government\u2019s submission of its periodic report.",
    "These include progress on addressing the 14,988 complaints filed with the Office on Missing Persons, and whether legal safeguards exist to prevent military authorities from investigating or prosecuting enforced disappearance cases.",
    "The Committee may also ask whether complaints have been lodged regarding the disappearance of members of the Tamil minority, those who went missing during daily protests beginning in Colombo in March 2022, and cases linked to the country\u2019s civil conflict between 1983 and 2009.",
    "The review forms part of the Committee\u2019s mandate to monitor State compliance with the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Its concluding observations on Sri Lanka will be published after the dialogue."
