    "Amsterdam\u2019s city council has approved a proposal banning \u201cpolluting\u201d cruise ships as part of the city\u2019s latest move to clamp down on overtourism.",
    "A spokesperson for Amsterdam Deputy Mayor Hester van Buren, who has responsibility for the city\u2019s port, told CNN that the council approved a proposal on Thursday to close the city\u2019s cruise ship terminal.",
    "The center-left party D66, which sits on the council, said in a statement Thursday that the proposal was \u201cadopted with a clear majority.\u201d",
    "The municipality of Amsterdam will now investigate how to implement the proposal, according to van Buren\u2019s spokesperson. This will include discussions with the managers of the North Sea Canal, the councils of other cities on the canal and the Dutch government.",
    "D66 party chairwoman Ilana Rooderkerk emphasized in the statement that \u201cpolluting cruise ships do not fit with the sustainable ambitions\u201d of Amsterdam.",
    "\u201cCruise ships in the heart of the city do not fit into Amsterdam\u2019s goal of reducing the number of tourists,\u201d Rooderkerk added.",
    "Amsterdam is expected to receive more than 18 million overnight visitors this year. By 2025, that number could reach 23 million, in addition to another 24 million to 25 million day visits. Under a 2021 ordinance called \u201cAmsterdam Tourism in Balance,\u201d when the number of overnight visitors reaches 18 million, the council is \u201cobliged to intervene.\u201d",
    "Earlier this year, the city launched a campaign revamping its approach to tourism, notably including tactics designed specifically to discourage British tourists on stag parties.",
    "The online \u201cStay Away\u201d campaign aimed to deter young British men planning to visit Amsterdam to cut loose and \u201cgo wild,\u201d warning visitors between the ages of 18 and 35 of the consequences of of drinking too much, taking drugs or behaving antisocially.",
    "Amsterdam also announced this year that it would ban the use of marijuana on the street and take new steps to discourage alcohol in its red light district, the traditional center of the city\u2019s legal sex trade.",
    "This followed an announcement from the city in 2019 that it would end tours of the red light district, citing concerns about sex workers being treated as a tourist attraction.",
    "In its bid to \u201climit tourism and prevent nuisance,\u201d Amsterdam also plans to restrict river cruises, convert hotels into offices and impose earlier closing times on bars and clubs.",
    "However, it\u2019s unlikely the city center will become a cruise free zone anytime soon, the deputy mayor\u2019s spokesperson told CNN, admitting the proposal will \u201ctake some time\u201d to implement."
