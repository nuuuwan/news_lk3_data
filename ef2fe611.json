    "Sri Lanka took three second innings wickets to keep their hopes alive in the first Test against Pakistan in Galle, though the hosts ended the fourth day needing just 83 more runs for victory.",
    "The home team was bowled out for 279, leaving Pakistan, who held a 149-run first innings lead, with a 131-run target.",
    "Pakistan had reduced that deficit by 48 runs at stumps, but not before Prabath Jayasuriya dismissed Abdullah Shafique and Shan Masood, and nightwatchman Noman Ali was run out.",
    "Pakistan still remain favourites, though on a wearing Galle wicket, the hosts will still believe they can pull off a win."
