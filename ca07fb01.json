    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s former speaker Karu Jayasuriya has reiterated a call for abolishing the all-powerful executive presidency, expressing his hope that candidates for the upcoming presidential election will pledge to do so.",
    "Speaking at an event on Tuesday January 02, Jayasuriya said attempts by past leaders and governments to do away with the presidency were scuttled by various actors for political reasons.",
    "The former speaker, who was once deputy leader of the United National Party (UNP), also discussed the importance of abolishing\u00a0 the executive presidency to resolving Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-long ethnic issue.",
    "\u201cAs long as there is no trust between the Sinhalese and the Tamils, we cannot advance as a country. The national question cannot be solved through politics alone, because there will be various resistive influences,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIn 2000, then President Chandrika Bandaranaiake Kumaratunga tried to abolish the executive presidency and roll out a new constitution. This was a valuable proposal. But for political reasons it could not be taken forward,\u201d said Jayasuriya.",
    "It was, in fact, the UNP, the main opposition party at the time, that opposed Kumaratunga\u2019s move, going so far as to burn a copy of the draft constitution in parliament.",
    "\u201cDuring the [UNP-led] Yahapalana government days, attempts were made to establish a new constitution and work according to that. That too was unsuccessful due to narrow political and racist views,\u201d said Jayasuriya.",
    "\u201cWe saw in the media that the clergy has said this cannot continue, and this problem must not be transferred to the next generation, and that we need everybody\u2019s support to resolve it.",
    "\u201cWe have seen how this country suffered from racism, extremism. We need everyone\u2019s support to prevent this country from being destroyed by the flames of racism and religious extremism and take it forward to a new era,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayasuriya heads the National Movement for Social Justice, which he said continues to stand for the abolition of the executive presidency.",
    "\u201cWe hope all candidates for the next election will make this promise to the people,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jan03/2023)"
