Harnessing RE resources offers energy security and creates avenues for investment with skilled job opportunities opening for management, financial and technical specialists

Some of the factors that discourage investment flow and impede rapid development are the current sovereign credit risk ratings, state of the economy, risks associated with the principal sector player – the CEB, uncertainties associated with ongoing power sector reforms, cumbersome regulatory framework and seeming ineffectiveness of the regulator – PUCSL, expressions of environmental concern and geopolitics that influences project financing and development

I was an attendee at the International Conference on “Reimagining of the Electricity Industry for the Future” held on 28 November 2024 organised by the Sri Lanka branch of The Institution of Engineering and Technology. The event was well attended and enlightening. My sincere thanks to the organisers for staging this impressive event.

At least 110 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti’s Cite Soleil slum when a gang leader targeted elderly people he suspected of causing his child’s illness through witchcraft, the National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) said on Sunday.

Wharf Jeremie gang leader Monel “Mikano” Felix ordered the massacre after his child became sick, RNDDH said, saying that he sought advice from a Voodoo priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft.

Gang members killed at least 60 people on Friday and 50 on Saturday using machetes and knives, it said.

Cite Soleil, a densely populated slum by the port of the capital Port-au-Prince, is among the poorest and most violent areas of Haiti.

Tight gang control, including the restriction of mobile phone use, has limited residents’ ability to share information about the massacre.

Felix, who heads the Wharf Jeremie gang, was in 2022 banned from entering neighboring Dominican Republic.

### America has two presidents as the world braces for another Trump term

The election of Donald Trump as US President for yet another term has sent many world leaders scurrying for cover. Especially in the West. But even China is concerned. In the US itself, the longstanding maxim that there can only be one president at a time is being put to the test every day. Joe Biden, the outgoing president, is scrambling to salvage his legacy after a disastrous last year that has diminished all his achievements over the first three years on the domestic front.

Externally, Biden’s presidency has been a monumental failure, from the impulsive withdrawal from Afghanistan that kickstarted it, to the hopelessly painful stalemate in Ukraine and the relentless mass devastation in Gaza that are dragging out its end. With the pardoning of his son Hunter Biden, the outgoing president has ceded even the little moral hump that he had over Trump.

### The Nehru Letters: Correspondence between Pandit Nehru and JRJ between 1940-1947

*2024-12-09 14:17:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-nehru-letters-correspondence-between-pandit-nehru-and-jrj-between-1940-1947/) · `en`

One of my treasured possessions has been my correspondence with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister and maker of modern India. These were a collection of letters exchanged between us between 1940 and 1947. In July 1971, in response to an appeal published in the newspapers by Mrs Indira Gandhi, I forwarded photostat copies of the correspondence to her. I also sent her a letter explaining the spirit and framework of the correspondence. The collection of letters is reproduced here, as a token of my treasured recollections of one of the most remarkable leaders I was privileged to know.

Donald Trump will spend the next three months finalising his Cabinet. He will assume office on January 20, and, if we are to believe what he says, will start implementing his America First policy by imposing some of the most extensive tariffs ever enforced by the United States. He has promised to impose them not just on China, but also Mexico and Canada – unless the latter two do something about illegal immigration to America.

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



"Excise licenses granted under rules. Gov't earns 3.1Bn in 9 months. Fees increased & new amendments implemented Feb 2024. Annual permit fee: 1Mn. Liquor licenses auctioned, 25% fund for relaxation measures. Court case on license issuance due to public complaints."

🟩

In a statement issued by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's office, all the licenses are granted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Department of Excise.

The announcement also stated that the total income earned by the government in the nine months through the prosecuting Uri Mangal will be over 3.1 billion rupees.

After independence, the government did not charge money to grant the excise license until 2022. By then, the tendency to lose direct taxes in the country was shown. At the time, the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Ways told the government to take appropriate action to get rid of the country's rigorous economic bankruptcy. Accordingly, as an alternative to the immediate direct tax loss, it was decided to increase the government's revenue, collect money and grant the excise license.
