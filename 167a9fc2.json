    "Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott and player Azmatullah Omarzai were fined for two separate incidents during the second T20I against Bangladesh.",
    "Both Jonathan Trott and Azmatullah Omarzai were docked 15 percent of their match fees for a Level 1 Code of Conduct breach during the second T20I against Bangladesh.",
    "The match in Sylhet was truncated by rain when Afghanistan were batting first. The lengthy rain break resulted in the game being reduced to 17 overs. During the break, Trott showed his displeasure during an umpire inspection when informed that there would be a further delay in resumption.",
    "Omarzai was found guilty of breaching Article 2.5 of the ICC Code of Conduct, relating to \u201cusing language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.\u201d",
    "In the 15th over of the chase, Omarzai gave Bangladesh batter Towhid Hridoy a close send-off after snaring his wicket.",
    "In addition to the fine, both Trott and Omarzai have received one demerit point, which is their first offence in a 24-month period. The pair accepted the sanctioned Match Referee Neeyamur Rashid and there was no need for a formal hearing.",
    "Bangladesh went on to win the match comfortably, chasing down a target of 117 with six wickets and five balls to spare. The Tigers managed to put behind the disappointment of losing the ODI series 2-1 with a 2-0 sweep of the T20I leg of the tour. (ICC)"
