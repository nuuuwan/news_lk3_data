    "You are now the hope of those seven million pleading for a better quality of life",
    "Your opponents\u2019 claim was that you lack experience in the top job, they are correct. You do not have the experience of bringing down an entire economy, you do not have the experience of corrupt practices or poor governance. However, you have been able to observe these taking place over the years and that should have given you lessons and insights to bring such practices to an end. So never fear to try the untested",
    "As they say in the classics, it\u2019s done and dusted. Your long cherished dream of leading your country has come to fruition. It has been a long struggle from your humble beginnings in the village of Tambuttegama to the Presidential Palace in Colombo. Yet you have not lost your humility and simple way of life and the kitchen staff at President\u2019s House will need to change menus to village style rice and curry dishes instead of French cuisines including award winning wines.",
    "Your victory is a case study in marketing. You turned a 3% market share to a 43% market share in the space of five years despite all the false marketing propaganda by your competitors. Despite most of the media working against you, your digital keyboard warriors conveyed your messages effectively and completely obliterated the opposition. That digital marketing team will surely be much in demand just as Obama\u2019s team of data scientists and analysts made global headlines in 2008 when they swept him into power.",
    "Your strategy team used a tactic that every successful corporate organisation is employing today, KYC \u2013 Know Your Customer. Who better to have exploited this tactic than yourself who could relate to the seven million Lankans living below the poverty line without three meals a day or the chance to send their children to school regularly? You have lived through that experience. Your opponents sitting in the lounge rooms of their Colombo mansions sipping on gin and tonic could not empathise with those millions in dire need. You are now the hope of those seven million pleading for a better quality of life.",
    "The shock and awe of your victory has left your opponents and detractors still reeling from the knock-out blow. Their supporters claim that 57% of the population rejected you not realising that 68% rejected your opponent. Sour grapes take all forms of irrationality.",
    "You may not speak English, but you speak the language of the heart that the masses can relate to. Many are the global leaders who do not speak the language of the Brits but they get by \u2013 sometimes better than those who do. But you have recognised the need to surround yourself with some of the best and brightest minds and eloquent tongues. You have also promised the future generations of Lankans the opportunity to learn the global language \u2013 the opportunity that was not available to you as a child.",
    "Enough of the gloating, Mr. President, your opponents\u2019 anguish at missing out should suffice. But now it\u2019s time to get down to business.",
    "I am sure that your throng of qualified advisors and consultants will employ some of the concepts of driving success in good organisations. They must introduce you to the concept of the \u2018low hanging fruit\u2019 \u2013 going for the easy wins fast. And, previous regimes, by way of their graft, corruption and lives of debauchery have left entire orchards of low hanging fruit ready for the picking. So go for it. You know what they are. This will give you credibility and show your resolve.",
    "Your opponents\u2019 claim was that you lack experience in the top job, they are correct. You do not have the experience of bringing down an entire economy, you do not have the experience of corrupt practices or poor governance. However, you have been able to observe these taking place over the years and that should have given you lessons and insights to bring such practices to an end. So never fear to try the untested. Those who voted for you voted for change and now they are waiting to see a difference. If your strategies are to fail, then fail fast and move on to the next. That is what business schools teach and what successful organisations do. The secret is not to continue to pursue the same failed strategies that led the country to where it is. Doggedly pursue your vision of the promised land and the beautiful life for Sri Lankans.",
    "You travelled the world extensively in the lead up to the Presidential race and your opponents kept wondering what you were up to. Little did they realise that you were taking stock of your country\u2019s intellectual wealth and capabilities among the global diaspora. Many of them would be standing by to help you on the long and hard road ahead. Draw upon the talents of those who were shown the door by your predecessors who are eager to give back to the land of their birth.",
    "However, Mr. President do not rest on your laurels. You\u2019ve done the hard work, you won the race. The challenge facing you now is how to stay on top and deliver the goods you promised. There are actions you can take and things you can deliver with the significant power you wield. Remember though that power must by exercised wisely. Let not power intoxicate you as it did your predecessors. Your satisfaction will come from seeing the beautiful land of Sri Lanka blossom to its full potential. That is the champagne you can enjoy along with all Sri Lankans.",
