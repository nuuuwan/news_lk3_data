    "The application process for the \u201cPresidential Scholarship Program 2024/25\u201d targeting 100,000 school students facing economic difficulties is now open, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) reported.",
    "Accordingly, in line with the vision of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, applications will be accepted until March 20, 2024.",
    "To apply, interested candidates can access the application form, instructions and all the relevant information in Sinhala, Tamil and English through the official Facebook page of the President\u2019s Fund at www.facebook.com/president.fund and the official website www.presidentsfund.gov.lk, and are required to submit their completed applications to their respective school principals before the deadline.",
    "The Ministry of Education has issued a special circular to Zonal/Provincial Education Offices and all Principals of the government schools across the island regarding the selection process. Each school\u2019s principal will head a committee responsible for selecting eligible students, with oversight from regional and provincial education authorities.",
    "The selection criteria outlined in the circular must be strictly adhered to, ensuring transparency throughout the process.",
    "It\u2019s important to note that applications should not be sent directly to the President\u2019s Fund. Once the Ministry of Education forwards the list of selected scholarship recipients, along with their applications and details, the President\u2019s Fund is set to disburse the scholarships over the course of 12 months starting from April 2024.",
    "The scholarship program aims to support 100,000 students from Grade 1 to Grade 11, spanning across 10,126 schools in Sri Lanka. A budget of Rs 3600 million has been allocated from the President\u2019s Fund for the entire program.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s vision behind this initiative is to ensure continuous access to education for children across the country. By identifying talented students studying under challenging circumstances and providing them with necessary support, the program aims to invest in the enhancement of Sri Lanka\u2019s human capital."
