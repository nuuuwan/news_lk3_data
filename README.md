Farmers in the Anuradhapura District who cultivated lime are in a predicament for want of a remunerative market for their produce, while the price of lime has skyrocketed in urban areas due to the ongoing racket of the middleman.

The National Consumers’ Organisation Asela Sampath told the media after attending a programme in Thalawa Divisional Secretariat that the farmers were being exploited by the racketeers who purchased their produce at very low prices.

“The wholesale purchase price of lime in Anuradhapura area is Rs. 50.00 per kilo, but the current market price is Rs. 2,000. Farmers are not harvesting their yield to avoid heavy losses. The yield is left under the trees. Other agricultural produce face a similar fate. The current market price of ginger is Rs. 4,000. A mechanism should be worked out to preserve lime and other agricultural produce that are abundant during the harvesting season for the off-season market.

### Preparing For Free & Fair Elections

*2024-05-14 01:30:48* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/preparing-for-free-fair-elections/) · `en`

Elections provide a unique situation where people become equal regardless of their class or ethnic and religious identity. This offers space to rival politicians to address their unmet needs. The government has commenced several development initiatives that will take resources to the community level in a targeted manner. These initiatives would be beneficial to the government in mustering support for it at the grassroots level. Those who wield governmental power have the ability to make tangible offerings to the people to secure their vote in a time of elections. The intervention of the Election Commission and civil society organisations in disapproving some of these governmental actions and ensuring free and fair elections needs to be seen in this light.

The Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) division will leverage research to provide guidance in navigating complex governance challenges, and shape sectoral and general anti-corruption solutions.

As the newest division of Verité Research, GAC will work collaboratively with the economy, media and politics, and law divisions to enhance Verité’s standing as an interdisciplinary think tank.

### Four arrested in Sampur for commemorating war dead

Three females and a male were arrested by the Sampur Police on Sunday night for violating a court order by holding a commemoration event in remembrance of the Mullivaikkal war dead. According to sources, the arrested had allegedly distributed porridge to neighbours in memory of their relatives who were killed during the armed conflict.

The police, armed with a court order prohibiting such commemorative events, apprehended the four persons amidst a tense situation, as depicted in video footage showing the women being forcibly taken away.

The arrested were further remanded until 27 May after being presented to the Mutur Magistrates Court yesterday.

In 2016, the Human Rights Commission urged the Government to uphold the right to remember deceased relatives. However, activists view recent police arrests as a grave concern, considering this recommendation.

### Foreigner, Freeman forced out of Parliament 90 years ago First British passport holder elected to Parliament in 1924

Born in March 1864, Herbert Rayner Freeman was elected to the Legislative Council-(LG) under the Colebrook Constitution in 1924, representing the North-Central Province

Freeman was known to traverse miles along jungle trails, visiting the ill and those in need, always carrying his iconic umbrella. Remarkably, he even attended court sessions to advocate for individuals he believed had been unfairly accused in criminal cases

Abolish the National List; empower the electorate to choose their representatives. The current system is flawed, with party leaders and secretaries often lacking insight. They appoint individuals with dubious backgrounds, including terrorists and non-citizens, merely for financial gain. This practice undermines the credibility of our democratic principles and turns them into a farce. Let’s restore integrity to our electoral process by allowing people to have a direct say in who represents them.

### Untangling Sri Lanka’s messy government structure

This means that from 2010-2023, 111 gazettes have been published to  change either the duties and functions assigned to ministries, the  institutions that are assigned to those ministries or the laws that  these ministries are supposed to implement

It would be an absolute surprise for someone walking into a local ministry to find everything crystal clear. Rather it could be just the opposite with the operation all over the place. Sri Lanka’s system of government has a history of assigning unrelated subjects to a single ministry, thereby including multiple departments and institutions under one roof. The latest blueprint document for rational government by Verité Research reveals that the compositions of ministries had undergone changes 111 times between 2010 and 2023.

According to the website www.politico.com Rishi Sunak’s Conservative  party is “marching inexorably towards annihilation” in  the next  parliamentary elections expected to be held either at the end of this  year or January 2025. This is indicated in the results of the local  council elections held throughout the UK on May 2

The influence of South Asians at the highest political levels in the  British Isles appears to be on the wane. However, there is speculation  that Leo Varadkar might take up a top job in the European Union and  become the first person of part-Indian origin to do so

But Varadkar could not solve Ireland’s acute housing problem. Under both  terms as Taoiseach, he failed to hit targets for affordable housing. A  whole generation of young voters were unable to purchase homes

Leo Varadkar and Humza Yousaf have resigned and Rishi Sunak is shaky

Election fever is in the air. Yet elections have not been announced. It’s ‘Fun-O-Rama’ time for politicians who are having a ball. Past President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his time was a past master at splitting political parties that

This time around, the ex-president’s party-the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- is one of the political outfits that is faced with several splits. The former chairman of the SLPP with 13 SLPP MPs defected and formed the ‘Freedom People’s Congress’. They now sit with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJP) in Opposition

SLPP strongman Basil Rajapaksa has demanded a General Election first. But added a rider as reported in the Daily Mirror on 8 May, that he would not leave room for a rift with the President. Former President Mahinda called for a rethink of the sale of state- owned enterprises, but in a very subdued tone.

The Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is at war with his Party chairman.

Sri Lanka, a country of rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty, has faced significant challenges in recent years, particularly in its tourism sector.

This paper delves into the intricate details of Sri Lanka’s tourism landscape, examining both the obstacles it faces and the strategies to overcome them.

### London…here I come

Versatile musician Hiruni Virginia Fernando is due to leave for London, today, to team up with her husband.

Of course, the local music scene would very much miss this highly talented artiste who has impressed many with her booming bass sounds.

A Trinity College London registered teacher, she did the needful, as music teacher, at Good Shepherd Convent Kotahena, Colombo 13, and at St. Lawrence’s Convent Wellawatte, Colombo 6.

She also played bass for C&C with Chandani Hettiarachchi and was seen in action, as a pianist, at the Galadari Hotel, in Colombo.

Hiruni says she will be busy with her music, in London, as well, but in a different format.

Her teaching skills will surface, once again, as she will be conducting leisure playing and exam-based online and physical classes, connected with the piano and guitar (bass, electric and classical guitar).

According to Hiruni, she will be operating from East Croydon, in London.

The weather in Dubai, the past few weeks, has been so unpredictable, but it has now improved and the entertainment scene is brightening up, once again, and with the spotlight being focused on Sri Lankans – music, fashion shows, etc.

News has come my way of a band, made up of all Sri Lankans, based in Dubai, who are doing extremely well…with their brand of music – a combination of western and oriental.

They call themselves Seven Notes and the musicians who make up this outfit are Nishan Jayasinghe (leader – drums), Niluk Uswaththa (bass guitar), Desh Munasinghe (lead guitar), Sisira Sajith (keyboards), Diluksha Madushan (percussion), Krishiy Young (female vocalist) and Dahaam Fernando (male vocalist).

According to bassist Niluk Uswaththa, although they operate as a seven-piece outfit, they have also got a newcomer, Rocky Jerom, doing the needful for them, as a singer.

Seven Notes are seen in action at Sri Lankan events, in Dubai, including dances and charity shows.

Having been raised and schooled in Kandy, I have watched the festivities of the Esala Perahera at least 10 times, as a child, and drawn it at least five times during my school years. August was the best month for schools in Kandy Lake Round. We used to get a long school vacation as schools closed to house the forces providing security to the Esala Perahera. Ice cream carts, cotton candy vendors, popcorn, isso-wadai, balloon animals, sadda-nalaa  [whistles for the lack of an English equivalent], glowsticks; August was carnivalesque for my childhood self. Growing up, I saw it more as a circus. Why do crowds raise their arms with “saadu saadu”? Why are elephants in this procession? Why do new mothers take their children under the belly of elephants for good luck? Do elephants have healing powers? Are they divine? Why are they chained then? Are they beastly?

It is mind boggling to perceive that in their haste to clinch as many FTAs as possible in obedience to the political masters in the fastest possible time with least dissent and negotiation, Sri Lanka is negotiating FTAs at the same level of its more developed partner countries opting for “substantial liberalisation” under GATT Article XXIV and Article V of the GATS in elimination of existing regulatory measures and prohibition of new regulations

While we challenge these individual attempts to dismantle our freedoms and rights, it is important to take a step back and see the monstrous governance apparatus that is growing

The proposed scheme appears to introduce legal legitimacy for the current oppressive treatment of non-governmental organisations. The scheme explicitly requires organisations to comply with governmental policy and agenda, rendering unlawful those who may criticise, challenge and question Government policy and agendas. It seeks to assert authority over all forms of non-governmental associations, groups and activities by introducing mandatory registration, whilst retaining powers to give directions to institutions that are specifically excluded from registration. The Government investment in the institutional mechanism and apparatus to oversee, supervise and direct non-governmental resources and activity is quite simply a taking control of the vast breadth of institutions and groups

Much of what he writes consists purely of smoke and mirrors. But let’s cut to the bone.

(Reuters) - France won a record 15 billion euros ($16.17 billion) in foreign investment pledges on Monday, allowing President Emmanuel Macron to bask in the limelight with global CEOs and forget about strained public finances and weak polls for a while.

The bumper crop of pledges, in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to pharmaceuticals and energy, stood Macron in good stead as he hosted business leaders for the annual “Choose France” summit at Versailles Palace.

This year’s figure is up from 13 billion euros announced in 2023.

The French presidency said the investments included 56 different business projects and could lead to the creation of 10,000 jobs.

Microsoft said it would invest 4 billion euros in France in its cloud and AI infrastructure, expanding its centres in Paris and Marseilles and adding a new data centre in the eastern city of Mulhouse.
