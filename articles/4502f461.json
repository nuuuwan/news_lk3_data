    "Cuban Minister for Labour and Social Security, Marta Elena Feit\u00f3-Cabrera, has been forced to resign from her post after she made comments in a parliamentary session which denied the existence of beggars on the Communist-run island.",
    "The minister had said there was no such thing as \u201cbeggars\u201d in Cuba and people going through rubbish were, in essence, doing so out of choice to make \u201ceasy money\u201d, as she put it.",
    "Her comments were widely criticised by Cubans at home and abroad, and prompted a response from the island\u2019s president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel. She resigned soon after.",
    "Poverty levels and food shortages have worsened in Cuba as it continues to grapple with a severe economic crisis.",
    "Feit\u00f3-Cabrera made the comments earlier this week at a session of the National Assembly, in which she spoke about people begging and rummaging through dustbins in Cuba.",
    "She appeared to deny their existence saying: \u201cThere are no beggars in Cuba. There are people pretending to be beggars to make easy money.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, she accused people searching through the rubbish of being \u201cillegal participants in the recycling service\u201d.",
    "The minister clearly misjudged the outrage and anger her comments would cause and the extent to which they portrayed the country\u2019s leadership as unfeeling, authoritarian and deeply disconnected from the dire economic struggles of ordinary Cubans.",
    "A number of Cuban activists and intellectuals published a letter calling for her removal saying the comments were \u201can insult to the Cuban people\u201d.",
    "The Cuban president then criticised Feit\u00f3-Cabrera at the parliamentary session - albeit without mentioning her by name - saying the leadership could not \u201cact with condescension\u201d or be \u201cdisconnected from the realities\u201d of the people.",
    "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal posted on X saying that there were \u201cpeople disguised as ministers\u201d in Cuba.",
    "Feit\u00f3-Cabrera\u2019s resignation was accepted by the Cuban Communist Party and the government.",
    "While the Cuban government does not publish official figures on the number of people begging, the rise in their number has been self-evident to most Cubans amid the island\u2019s deep economic crisis."
