### The president who handles another important challenge

*2024-11-02 11:00:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197697) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Sri Lankan government faces challenges in economy, travel advisories, and reconciliation. National People's Power wins local election, increasing support. New government maintains economic committee, gaining IMF confidence. Travel restrictions implemented due to terror threats. Government addresses concerns about foreign tourists' illegal activities. President announces provincial council elections to promote diversity and decentralization. Critics argue high costs, but decentralization crucial for addressing ethnic and regional disparities.

üü©

The government is very intelligent in its actions, if it is a matter of dealing with the economy, travel instructions or reconciliation process.

Experiences its resulting benefit. The victory of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha in the South is a sign that the popular population continues to increase after a month of power.

The increase in the currency expands to the national people's power, not limited to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The difference in the success of the national people's power is much greater than the last time it faced such a local election.

Earlier in 2019, the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha had two seats.

Now it has captured 15 designs. The national people's power, which received only six percent of the vote, now received 48 percent of the votes.

The increase in the victory of the National People's Power in the Local Government election is the result of the polls of voters that they will benefit after the victory of the national People's Power in the presidential election.

The nexus between climate change and human mobility has increasingly become an area of focus for research and policymaking

The nexus between climate change and human mobility has increasingly become an area of focus for researchers and policymakers in countries across the world. Climate change is transforming how people live, work, and move, and its impacts shape and influence the patterns of migration, disaster displacement, and planned relocation. Heat, droughts, floods, storms, landslides, and long-term processes such as sea level rise and increasing agricultural pests and diseases affect human mobility either directly or indirectly, ranging from seasonal rural out-migration to disaster displacement and from foreign employment to relocation out of high-risk areas.

The sheer volume of new candidates across the north-east is indicative of a highly politicised population and new blood will emerge from this

Tamils are fed up with the status quo. The prevailing anti-establishment sentiment is reflected in the fact that the 12 seats open in the Jaffna and Vanni electoral districts are contested by over 800 contestants, the vast majority of whom are independent candidates. Addressing the mere basics, such as day-to-day economic grievances, means a lot in a country like Sri Lanka, which has been wracked by instability for decades. The splintering of Tamil parties, all vying for votes with roughly the same nationalist (or pseudo-nationalist) platforms, may also lower each party‚Äôs vote share

Whether or not it ushers in an era of ‚Äútub-thumping ideology,‚Äù it has the potential to reshape the global landscape, given what is happening outside the USA. A Trump or Harris presidency would present contrasting impacts and consequences for the rest of the world, especially given their divergent views on international relations, climate policy, trade, investment, and alliances.

### Ceasefire hopes fade as Israel bombards Gaza, Lebanon

Prospects of a ceasefire between Israel and its foes Hamas and Hezbollah ran aground on Friday as Israeli airstrikes killed at least 64 people in the Gaza Strip, according to medics in the Palestinian enclave, and battered Beirut‚Äôs southern suburbs.

U.S. envoys had been working to secure ceasefires on both fronts ahead of the U.S. presidential election next Tuesday.

But Hamas did not favour a temporary truce, its Al-Aqsa Hamas television reported on Friday. The ceasefire proposals failed to meet its conditions that any deal must end the year-long war in Gaza and include a withdrawal of Israeli forces from there, it said.

Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his priority was to enforce security ‚Äúdespite any pressure or constraints‚Äù.

His office said he relayed this message to U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk in Israel on Thursday. Israel meanwhile pressed on with its military offensives against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon on Friday.
