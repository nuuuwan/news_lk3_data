We were very shocked by the most sad events in Nepal. The series of sang events that have created such a tremendous rebellion in the land of the Buddha cannot be granted.

It is evident that some conspiracy to evolve South Asian countries is acting.

Afterwards he said of the King “yes, he’s great” in response to reporters’ questions.

The meeting will be seen as a first step in improving relations between father and son and building trust in what has seemed a deep family rift.

The King travelled down to London from Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Prince Harry, who has been based in the US since 2020, has been in the UK this week for charity events.

Prince Harry had spoken emotionally in a BBC interview in May about wanting to rebuild relationships, saying: “I would love a reconciliation with my family.”

*2025-09-11 10:37:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/eudr-in-2025-is-sri-lanka-ready-for-the-eus-new-deforestation-rules-240147/) · `en`

The European Union’s Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) takes effect on 30 December 2025. This regulation aims to prevent deforestation associated with seven commodities—cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, soy, wood, and natural rubber—and products derived from them, such as tyres, chocolate, and wooden furniture. Any product exported to the EU market must be deforestation-free, legally produced according to the laws of the originating country, and traceable to the specific plot of land where it was sourced. In 2024, Sri Lanka exported 27 different rubber and rubber-based products at Harmonised System six-digit (HS-6-digit) to the EU worth USD 337.79 million (Mn). These products include solid or cushion tyres, gloves, mittens and mitts, new pneumatic tyres, and articles of vulcanised rubber (Figure 1). The EU remains a significant destination for these value-added exports, emphasising the importance of meeting EUDR requirements.
