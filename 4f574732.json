    "Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of three young men of Palestinian descent who were attending a Thanksgiving holiday gathering near the University of Vermont campus Saturday evening.",
    "Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested Jason J. Eaton, 48, while conducting a search of the shooting area in Burlington at 3:38 p.m. Sunday, the Burlington Police Department said in a statement.",
    "Authorities collected evidence during a search of Eaton\u2019s apartment in a building in front of the shooting location. He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, police said. Online court records did not list an attorney who could speak on Eaton\u2019s behalf.",
    "The attack that injured the three men around 6:25 p.m. Saturday may have been a hate crime, authorities previously said.",
    "Two of the men were in stable condition and the other suffered \u201cmuch more serious injuries,\u201d Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said in a statement Sunday. The three, all age 20, were walking during a visit to the home of one of the victim\u2019s relatives when they were confronted by a white man with a handgun, police said.",
    "\u201cWithout speaking, he discharged at least four rounds from the pistol and is believed to have fled,\u201d Murad said. \u201cAll three victims were struck, two in their torsos and one in the lower extremities.\u201d",
    "The victims are all of Palestinian descent. Two are U.S. citizens and the third is in the country with legal permission. Two of the men were wearing the black-and-white Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, Murad said.",
    "Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger is expected to join Murad at a press conference Monday to discuss the investigation.",
    "Murad, who expressed sympathies for the victims and their families, said there is no additional information to suggest a motive.",
    "\u201cIn this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime. And I have already been in touch with federal investigatory and prosecutorial partners to prepare for that if it\u2019s proven,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe fact is that we don\u2019t yet know as much as we want to right now,\u201d Murad added. \u201cBut I urge the public to avoid making conclusions based on statements from uninvolved parties who know even less.\u201d",
    "The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee released a statement Sunday saying that the victims were Palestinian American college students and that there is \u201creason to believe this shooting occurred because the victims are Arab.\u201d",
    "A man shouted and harassed the victims, who were conversing in Arabic, then proceeded to shoot them, the committee\u2019s statement said.",

    "\u201cWe are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our children,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe call on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation, including tating this as a hate crime. We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice.\u201d",
    "Ramallah Friends School posted a statement on Facebook saying the three young men were graduates of the private school, in the West Bank.",
    "\u201cWhile we are relieved to know that they are alive, we remain uncertain about their condition and hold them in the light,\u201d the school said. \u201cWe stand united in hope and support for their well-being during this challenging time.\u201d",
    "In response to the shooting, U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged people to \u201cunequivocally denounce the startling rise of anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia in America.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo one should ever be targeted for their ethnicity or religious affiliation in our country,\u201d the New York Democrat said in the statement posted on X. \u201cWe will not let hatred win.\u201d",
    "Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent, also denounced the shooting.",
    "\u201cIt is shocking and deeply upsetting that three young Palestinians were shot here in Burlington, VT. Hate has no place here, or anywhere. I look forward to a full investigation,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.",
    "Gov. Phil Scott called the shooting a tragedy, calling on the state\u2019s residents to unite and \u201cnot let this incident incite more hate or divisiveness.\u201d",
    "The Vermont-New Hampshire chapter of Jewish Voice For Peace, which has urged an end to the Israel-Hamas war, released a statement saying it was \u201cappalled by the shooting.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are in solidarity with the students, their families and all those affected by this clear act of hate,\u201d the organization said Sunday. \u201cWe are in solidarity with all Palestinian people in occupied Palestine, around the world, and here in Vermont \u2014 and we are committed to creating a Vermont that is safe and welcoming for all.\u201d",
    "The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy organization for Jewish people worldwide, also said via X it was \u201chorrified\u201d by the attack and urged \u201claw enforcement to investigate this act as a possible hate crime.\u201d",
    "Last month, an Illinois landlord was charged with a hate crime after being accused of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy and seriously wounding his mother in Chicago. Police and relatives said he singled out the victims because of their faith.",
    "Demonstrations have been widespread and tensions in the U.S. have escalated as the death toll rises in the Israel-Hamas war. A fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was back on track Sunday as the militants freed more hostages and Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners. It was the third exchange under a four-day truce deal."
