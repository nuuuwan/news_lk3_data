    "*\u00a0 Lanka Hospitals has established itself as a leading healthcare institution in Sri Lanka. Could you share a brief overview of the hospital\u2019s journey, key areas of service, and its vision for the future?",
    "Since opening its doors in 2002 as Apollo Hospitals Colombo, Lanka Hospitals has evolved into Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost multi-specialty tertiary care institution. Over the past two decades, it has established itself as a leader in advanced medical care, consistently raising the bar in quality, patient safety, and innovation in healthcare delivery.",
    "Lanka Hospitals offers comprehensive medical and surgical expertise across more than 30 specialties, including cardiology, neurosurgery, oncology, orthopaedics, urology, fertility treatment, and bariatric surgery. These services are further strengthened by dedicated Centers of Excellence, such as the Heart Centre, Mother & Baby Care, Kidney Transplant & Renal Care Unit, Fertility Centre, and Bariatric Surgery programme. Each centre brings together leading consultants, specialized teams, and state-of-the-art technology to deliver outcomes that meet the highest global standards.",
    "Diagnostic excellence is another cornerstone of the hospital\u2019s reputation. Through Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics (LHD), Sri Lanka\u2019s first internationally accredited medical reference laboratory, the hospital provides accurate, reliable, and internationally benchmarked diagnostic services that support both local and international healthcare needs.",
    "Recognition from global accreditation bodies has reinforced its standing. The Joint Commission International (JCI) Gold Seal of Approval and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation for LHD reflect the hospital\u2019s commitment to rigorous quality standards, patient safety, and continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.",
    "*\u00a0 How has the establishment of the Bank of Ceylon branch within Lanka Hospitals supported your operational needs, including staff salary disbursements, supplier and patient settlements, and the handling of other day-to-day financial transactions?",

As a leading private healthcare provider, how do you view this situation, and what steps are being taken by Lanka Hospitals to retain these patients by offering internationally competitive services locally?",
    "The outflow of patients seeking overseas medical treatment has long been a challenge for Sri Lanka, not only for the healthcare sector but also for the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves.

    "These medical advancements are complemented by global accreditation standards, including the prestigious Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation, which assures both Sri Lankan patients and international visitors of uncompromising safety and quality. To further strengthen its international reach, the hospital has established a dedicated International Patient Centre that provides personalized pre- and post-travel support, making Colombo an increasingly attractive destination for medical tourism in the region.",
    "*\u00a0 As a Chartered Accountant and seasoned professional in the sector, how do you view Bank of Ceylon\u2019s broader contribution to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic development?",
    "Viewed through the lenses of capital formation, inclusion, and stability, the Bank of Ceylon stands as a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic progress. By mobilizing domestic savings and channeling them into productive credit, the bank sustains the growth of small and medium enterprises, exporters, and essential services. Equally important, it has served as a counter-cyclical force in times of economic stress, maintaining liquidity and stability when the country has needed it most.",
    "Its extensive reach and robust digital infrastructure have widened access to financial services, formalized payments, and reduced transaction costs across the economy. For national institutions such as Lanka Hospitals, the impact of this partnership is deeply practical. Dependable working capital facilities, trade finance to support the import of vital medical equipment and consumables, and streamlined mechanisms for collections, payroll, and payments ensure that financial operations run without disruption.",

For staff, salary accounts with same-day credit, fee concessions, and reliable online banking ensure that payments are both seamless and secure. Salary-linked credit facilities, including personal loans, housing and vehicle finance, and education loans, are offered at preferential rates with rapid processing, giving employees greater financial flexibility and peace of mind.",

These solutions make it easier for professionals to focus on patient care while managing their practices more efficiently.",
