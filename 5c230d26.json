    "COLOMBO (News 1st); A tense exchange erupted in Sri Lanka's Parliament as Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa accused ruling party MPs, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, of using state-owned vessels for a lavish party at sea.",
    "Premadasa, in a fiery speech, highlighted the stark contrast between the alleged revelry of government officials and the struggles faced by ordinary citizens in a country declared bankrupt.",
    "He pointed to the recent cancellation of school children's season tickets as a symbol of the economic hardship prevailing across the nation.",
    "\"The entire country is flattened by the VAT,\" Premadasa declared, \"yet, ruling party MPs are using the 'Hansakawa' and 'Diyakaula' vessels of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to host a party in the sea with whiskey, food, and catering from the Authority itself. This is a sin!\"",
    "His statements were met with disapproval from the Speaker, who accused Premadasa of \"abusing the opportunity given to him.\" This, in turn, sparked a heated exchange with Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, the Chief Government Whip.",
    "Ranatunga dismissed Premadasa's accusations as an attempt to \"score brownie points\" and urged him to raise \"relevant questions\" for the subject minister to address. He further accused the Opposition Leader of lacking responsibility in his position.",
    "Ranatunga, in a sharp counterattack, invoked personal attacks, accusing Premadasa's family of past involvement in controversial incidents.",
    "This further escalated the tension, with Premadasa vehemently denying the allegations and threatening to expose Ranatunga's own \"conduct.\"",
    "Premadasa retaliated, \"Ask Public Security Minister Tiran Alles about funding the LTTE and whose money was used!\"",
    "Outrage is mounting following accusations that 50 members of parliament from the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party, led by MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, engaged in a luxurious three-hour party aboard two vessels belonging to the Colombo Port Authority.",
    "The event, which reportedly took place on the evening of January 9th, has sparked controversy amidst the country's ongoing economic crisis and struggles with basic necessities.",
    "Questions are being raised about the source of funding for this event, estimated to have cost millions of rupees.",
    "Port Trade Unions are demanding transparency and accountability, urging authorities to investigate the financial aspects of the event.",
    "Furthermore, concerns have been raised about potential violations of regulations regarding the use of the vessels, \"Hansakawa\" and \"Diyakowulla\". These vessels are reportedly designed for dredging purposes, and their capacity is limited to 26 passengers.",
    "The alleged involvement of Deputy Minister Premalal Jayasekara, Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, and Sanath Nishantha in organizing the party adds another layer of criticism, with accusations of extravagance and disregard for public funds.",
    "UPDATE: 60 targets, 16 locations, 100 bombs and missiles \u2013 US, UK strike the Houthis"
