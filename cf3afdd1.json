    "ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, \"demanded the immediate release and reinstatement of\u00a0President Muhammed Bazoum\u2026 and the full restoration of constitutional order\" and \"considers his illegal detention as a hostage situation\". Bazoum was overthrown in a military coup on July 26,",

    "No less than eight presidents and four foreign ministers met at \"the Extraordinary Summit of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government on the political situation in Niger\", in\u00a0Abuja, the capital of Nigeria. ECOWAS has several times in the past sent combined forces into countries in the region when civilian leaderships are threatened by military coups.",
    "Immediate measures will be taken by all ECOWAS states to isolate Niger from any activity with ECOWAS states, including the closing of all of the ECOWAS land and air borders of the landlocked Niger; suspending of all economic and financial transactions with Niger; freezing all of Niger's assets already deposited with commercial banks and central banks in ECOWAS states; freezing of all transactions of Niger through online transaction portals; freezing of all development assistance through the West African Development Bank; and a travel ban and freezing of assets of any Niger military officers involved in the coup and of any persons who assist the Niger military to form a government.",
