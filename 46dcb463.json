    "China hit back on Wednesday after U.S. President Joe Biden referred to President Xi Jinping as a \u201cdictator\u201d, saying the remarks were absurd and a provocation, in an unexpected spat immediately following efforts by both sides to lower tensions.",
    "Biden\u2019s comments came just a day after top U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to stabilize bilateral relations that China says are at their lowest point since formal ties were established.",
    "Attending a fundraiser in California, Biden said Xi was very embarrassed when a suspected Chinese spy balloon was blown off course over U.S. airspace early this year, making a personal comment on the Chinese leader when Blinken said on Monday the \u201cchapter\u201d should be closed.",
    "\u201cThe reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two box cars full of spy equipment in it was he didn\u2019t know it was there,\u201d Biden said.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a great embarrassment for dictators. When they didn\u2019t know what happened. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be going where it was. It was blown off course,\u201d Biden added.",
    "Xi became China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong after securing a precedent-breaking third term as president in March and head of the Communist Party in October.",
    "A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Biden\u2019s remarks were \u201cextremely absurd\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d.",
    "Expressing China\u2019s strong dissatisfaction, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Biden\u2019s comments seriously violated facts, diplomatic protocol and China\u2019s political dignity.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re an open political provocation,\u201d she told a news conference.",
    "Asked how aware Xi had been about the balloon\u2019s movements, Mao reiterated China\u2019s previous explanation that the passage of the balloon through U.S. airspace had been unintended and caused by circumstances beyond its control.",
    "\u201cBiden\u2019s big mouth is a loose cannon,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.",
    "\u201cMutual trust is what China has been stressing, so Biden\u2019s comments are very destructive and damaging,\u201d Wu said, while adding that the remarks may not totally undo what Blinken had achieved on his China visit.",
    "Blinken and Xi agreed in their meeting on Monday to stabilize the intense rivalry between Washington and Beijing so it did not veer into conflict.",
    "While no breakthroughs were made during the first visit to China by a U.S. secretary of state for five years, both sides did agree to continue diplomatic engagement with more visits by U.S. officials in the coming weeks and months.",
    "Biden said later on Tuesday that U.S. climate envoy John Kerry may go to China soon.",
    "A day earlier, on Monday, Biden said he thought relations between the two countries were on the right path, and he indicated that progress was made during Blinken\u2019s trip.",
    "Chiming in from Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Biden\u2019s comments contradicted the efforts of his secretary of state to ease tensions with Beijing, describing the remarks as \u201cincomprehensible\u201d.",
    "\u201cThese are very contradictory manifestations of U.S. foreign policy, which speak of a large element of unpredictability,\u201d Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cHowever, that\u2019s their business,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cWe\u2019ve our own bad relations with the United States of America and our very good relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d"
