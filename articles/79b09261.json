    "Government of Sri Lanka Ministry of Transport and Highways Secretary Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe and Greater Colombo Urban Transport Development Project Project Director Nalaka Dissanayaka launched the Uber Pick-up point along with Uber Sri Lanka Country Manager Kaushalya Gunaratne",
    "Travellers arriving at the Makumbura Multimodal Centre (MMC) can now get a reliable, convenient and affordable Uber ride from a dedicated Uber pick-up point. Situated strategically within Sri Lanka\u2019s expressway network, the MMC serves as a crucial intersection for travellers between Colombo and Southern coastal destinations.",
    "As local passengers and international tourists arrive at the Centre, they can just fire up the familiar Uber app and get a comfortable ride without haggling for prices or searching for a ride on the road. The Uber pick-up point was launched recently in the presence of Government of Sri Lanka Ministry of Transport and Highways Secretary Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe and Uber Sri Lanka Country Manager Kaushalya Gunaratne.",
    "Lauding the launch of the Uber pick-up point, Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe said, \u201cAs Sri Lanka\u2019s first such multimodal centre, the Makumbura Multimodal Centre opens up new possibilities and adds a new dimension to the country\u2019s public transport system. Uber enjoys the familiarity and trust of several Sri Lankans and international tourists who are regular users of the app in other countries. Having the comfort to book a ride through the phone at a busy junction and get details of the trip, the driver, and the car, within a few minutes will provide value to passengers.\u201d",
    "Uber Sri Lanka Country Manager Kaushalya Gunaratne said, \u201cAs the most loved global mobility app \u2013 the launch of this dedicated transit point is an extension of our commitment to serve the commuters in Sri Lanka \u2013 be it locals or tourists. We bring the same convenience and safety support to the Makumbura Multimodal Centre that people have come to associate us with world over. These last-mile connectivity solutions help travellers plan their transportation better and easy app access makes rides accessible to a wider population. We will continue to bring the best of Uber to Sri Lanka and do everything to elevate Sri Lanka as a top global tourist destination.\u201d",
    "Passengers arriving at MMC can seek booking assistance from the Uber pick-up point. Riders will get upfront fares for trips, details of the driver and vehicle, and ETA. Uber drivers will have designated parking spaces at the centre that will help reduce wait times and make travel seamless. Last year, as an industry first, Uber had launched a dedicated pick-up point at the Bandaranaike International Airport to help riders and drivers alike. Clear way finding signage for travellers to the Uber pick-up spot, and easy entry and exit for Uber drivers, has transformed the airport travel experience."
