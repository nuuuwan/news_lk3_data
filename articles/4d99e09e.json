    "Although I still haven\u2019t finished with my Cucumber beauty tips, I thought I\u2019ll tackle the hair growth problem this week and then go back to my Cucumber scene\u2026probably next week.",
    "You will need 01 medium-size onion (helps in stimulating hair follicles), a handful of curry leaves (promotes hair growth and strengthens hair roots), 02 tablespoons of coconut oil (moisturizes the scalp and adds shine), and the contents from 02 vitamin E capsules (nourishes hair follicles and promotes growth).",
    "Heat the coconut oil in a pan, over low heat, and then add the chopped onion and curry leaves to the heated coconut oil.",
    "Saut\u00e9 them together until the onions turn translucent and the curry leaves become crispy. This helps infuse their nutrients into the oil.",
    "Strain the oil, using a fine sieve or cheesecloth, to separate the solid particles (onion and curry leaves) from the oil. You should be left with infused coconut oil.",
    "Pierce the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil into the strained mixture.",
    "Mix well to ensure the vitamin E oil is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.",
    "Before applying, make sure your hair is dry, or slightly damp.",
    "Using your fingers, or a brush, apply the mixture directly to your scalp and gently massage it in for 5-10 minutes.",
    "Once your scalp is covered, apply any remaining mixture to the lengths of your hair.",
    "Cover your hair with a shower cap, or towel, and leave the mask on for at least 01 hour, or, preferably, overnight for better absorption.",
    "Wash your hair thoroughly with a mild shampoo to remove the oil and any smell of onion.",
    "(Use this hair growth mask 01-02 times a week for best results.)",
