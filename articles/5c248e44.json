    "The British Council\u2019s South Asia Deep Dialogues event took place from 10-11 December in Colombo. With the theme of: \u201c\u2018Widening access to quality tertiary education through transnational education\u2019, Deep Dialogues\u00a0brought leading experts, policymakers, and education sector professionals from the UK and South Asia to discuss the potential of transnational education (TNE), particularly as a significant driver of educational transformation, the knowledge economy and sustainable development goals.",
    "Trust and respect are fundamental to establishing mutually beneficial partnerships that will significantly improve the quality of teaching, curricula, policies, and, ultimately, the student experience.",
    "Quality assurance needs to be at the heart of TNE development and delivery so that\u00a0students receive high quality education. At the same time, higher education and quality assurance systems must be resilient enough to navigate the evolving landscape of course delivery, content, and student diversity, while fostering trust and confidence among all stakeholders.",
    "As TNE expands and transforms, education leaders face increasingly complex challenges in\u00a0balancing local contexts with internationalisation goals. We need resilient, culturally intelligent leaders to navigate diverse stakeholder expectations.",
    "Notable discussions at the Deep Dialogues revolved around creating an understanding of how TNE can make positive contribution to social development goals, lead to employability, exploring various TNE models, discussing quality assurance and approaches to implementation of TNE policy frameworks.",
    "Buoyed by rating agencies\u2019 positive assessments, CSE increases in bullishness",
