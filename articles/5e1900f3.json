    "A gathering of over 75 years women; happy hellos, fellowship and high tea. All this and more at a party on Saturday 12 July late afternoon to evening, to bring together and felicitate the older members of the Girls\u2019 High School OGA (Colombo branch). The excellent organisers were the young, very capable present committee of Old Girls.",
    "The School Song was lustily sung at the start of the happy afternoon and again later when a distinguished professional \u2013 once Dean of a Faculty of the Colombo University and actimg VC \u2013 proposed we sing the all-time favourite, our school song \u201cFollow On\u201d. And so again:",
    "Memory certainly crowded the mind with delightful incidents of the happiest time of our lives, notwithstanding it was not forty years but even eighty for some as \u2018Visions of girlhood\u2019 floated before us as we recalled \u201cGoing once more through our work and our fun",
    "There certainly was much laughter, more girlhood giggles than outright laughter since mothers and teachers never encouraged exuberance; too much loud sprightliness not being ladylike. Tears? Yes, when teachers punished us, when friends suddenly discarded you and much later as boyfriends betrayed you. I was a hostelite from Form 2 onwards \u2013 age 12/13. We were just 32 of us with Miss Kaule as our Matron \u2013 strict with her ruler on your palm when you needed punishment, but kind and concerned, and not too conservative. I had no problem with boyfriends since that species avoided even glancing at me. But romances sprang up with Sunday service at the Methodist Church which meant Kingswood College boys were present, and church organized Thursday evenings of getting together and once in a while a campfire of girl guides and boy scouts.",
    "That final line so meaningful to those present on the 12th who depended on walkers, walking sticks and even one or two in wheel chairs. I was in the first netball team from early on \u2013 age 15 or so \u2013 and at a match with Badulla High School where our principal, Miss Ruth Allen, had been transferred to after her furlough in Ireland, I was cheered as Baby by onlookers. The team travelled by train to Badulla, chaperoned by Miss Kaule, and did we not have fun including a trek to the Dunhinda Falls with the Badulla team. Early morning as we approached the railway station to return to Kandy, there was Miss Allen come to bid us a tearful goodbye in a wollen cap with red pong pongs on it. She loved KHS.",
    "Matches with Hillwood were dreaded. They wore full sari and had their hair upswept in kondes, while we were in divided-skirts with cropped hair or plaits. In spite of the impediment of conservative dress, the Hillwood team was excellent, actually ferociously so.",
    "Nostalgia, gratitude to parents, the long ago principals and teachers, remembered with appreciation; and mostly to our school \u2013 Kandy High \u2013 which gave us so much, and nurtured us to be what we are today; some professionals who reached the top, some happy to be on the middle rungs and those who opted to be good wives and mothers, which last was then preferred by conservative mothers of the Hill Country. Girls from KHS still have a particular modesty and lady like personality.",
    "And for the 12th July get-together of the most senior Old Girls, we express deep appreciation to the present OGA (Col Branch) Committee for holding the event. Not only did the Oldies enjoy the superbly organized games, music and tripping the light fantastic (those who could) but it was a time of sweet remembering of years spent in that wonderful school in Kandy. Planning such a high tea needs time, effort and consideration. From the time we arrived at the venue, members of the present committee were at hand to help us and extend ready hands all through the evening till goodbyes were said. This party for over 75s has become an annual event.",
    "Also created was a fund with much in it of individual contributions and from very successful annual fund raisers. Old Girls in need of medical care, new spectacles et al, are helped financially as are some gifted free tickets for OGA AGMs, picnics and Xmas parties. For this event we paid a nominal amount for superb finger food and tea/coffee, with a one man band enlivening the evening.",
    "Girls High School Kandy was started in 1879 as a Wesleyan Missionary school by Rev Samuel Langdon and his wife who was the first principal. It began with 11 students at the Wesleyan Chapel in Katukelle, and has now thousands on the rolle with about 200 teachers. It became an assisted, fee levying school and is now a government school.",
    "Honour boards in the main hall mounted below photographs of former principals are testimony to the various fields of professions and honours won by KHS girls.",
