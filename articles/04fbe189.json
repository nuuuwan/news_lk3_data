The move comes amidst concerns over excessive public expenditure, with the Government having spent Rs. 1,488 million on the security of former presidents over the past eleven and a half months.",
    "Delivering a special statement, Minister Wijepala emphasised that the decision aims to reduce unnecessary spending of public funds while addressing public discontent.",
    "\u201cThe excessive use of public resources on politicians has led to dissatisfaction among the people,\u201d the Minister noted. \u201cThis is not about targeting any particular former president but about introducing accountability and prudent spending.\u201d",
    "He clarified that under the Presidential Rights Act, there is no specific directive on the quantum of security to be provided. Security arrangements for former leaders are determined following proper assessments, including recommendations by the Chitrasiri Committee, which evaluates the level of threats.",
    "The Minister revealed that Rs. 710 million had been spent on the security of Mahinda Rajapaksa, with a cost of Rs. 328 million incurred by the tri-forces, Rs. 327 million by the police, and Rs. 55 million by the Presidential Secretariat.

    "Minister Wijepala reiterated that such levels of expenditure, amounting to Rs. 1,488 million, place an undue burden on public finances. \u201cThis is a very difficult situation, especially considering the economic challenges faced by the country,\u201d he stressed.",
    "The Minister further elaborated on the current security arrangements for the former presidents and other VIPs. Mahinda Rajapaksa has been provided with 60 police officers and 228 tri-forces officers for security and related activities, while Maithripala Sirisena has 4 military officers and 60 police officers assigned as security guards. Gotabaya Rajapaksa currently receives security from 210 tri-forces personnel and 22 police officers.
