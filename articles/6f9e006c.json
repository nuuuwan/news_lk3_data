    "\u2018Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the South Asian region have strong apparel sectors which have been impacted by high apparel import tariffs imposed by the US government. Against this backdrop, dialogue and diplomacy by the respective governments are being channelized to reduce them. Meanwhile, ways are being explored by the South Asian neighbours to diversify their apparel exports to trading blocs, such as BRICS, a top official attached to a major international textile sourcing company said.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is positioned as a gateway to international apparel sector sourcing because of its strong relationships with South Asian countries that enables intra-regional trade. South Asia is a powerhouse for textiles and apparel; the supply chain is not very robust right now. While the US market can\u2019t be ignored, exploring other trade opportunities and realignments is happening and markets are evaluating how to diversify exports to other trading blocs like BRICS, which is aligning to zero tariffs, and the EU, which is encouraging Developing Countries Trade Schemes (DCTS), Worldex India, Executive Director Ms. Aarti Bhagat told the media at a zoom meeting held in Colombo from India recently.",
    "Bhagat added: \u2018Understanding the gap in the region, we created an international textile sourcing show in Sri Lanka, which provides access to the Sri Lankan garment and textile industry for different countries in the world. Accordingly, the biggest textile sourcing show over the past 10 years in South Asia will be held in Sri Lanka.",

    "\u2018This year, the show has doubled in size from last year, making it the biggest show in Sri Lanka and across the South Asia region.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ve also invited buyer delegations from South Asia, ASEAN, Middle East, and other countries to facilitate their sourcing from different suppliers at the exhibition and also engage them with B2B meetings with Sri Lankan industry leaders and stakeholders to explore and understand the potential of working with each other.
