### Ravi K defends NDF National List appointment

MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday attended the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament as the National List appointment of the New Democratic Front (NDF).

Speaking to the media, he affirmed that his appointment via the NDF’s National List was legal, insisting that he was rightfully nominated by the party.

“It is just two members who are making a big fuss over my nomination, not the entire party,” he claimed, commenting on the controversy surrounding his nomination as the NDF National List candidate.

MP Karunanayake argued that as a senior member of the United National Party (UNP) he has sacrificed a lot and underwent many challenges for the betterment of the party. “We cannot sacrifice our party for the benefit of mere 2-3% of people. Those who know, know,” he said.  Karunanayake said once the agreements that were agreed by the parties are released to the public domain, it will answer many of these questions.

### Sri Lanka’s SMEs: Debt-trapped dilemma

A substantial portion of Sri Lankan SMEs, approximately 70%, are currently insolvent or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy

A cornerstone of successful debt recovery lies in preserving the business’s operational viability rather than resorting to liquidation. Many debt restructuring solutions fall short by neglecting the critical aspect of cash flow matching, which is fundamental to servicing debt obligations. By strategically realigning assets based on their utilisation, it is possible to strike a balance between debt recovery and cash generation, fostering a more sustainable recovery process

It appears that FDIs most probably have deliberately avoided investing in SL mainly due to the poor political instability prevailing in the country from about 1956

The path to prosperity of Sri Lanka starts from political stability to enable it to attract mainly FDI as it lacks the capital, skills, technologies and the required international market access to start an export-led strategy of economic development to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty. In this strategy it is important to emphasise on promoting especially the productivity (of the private sector, (which has been described as the ‘the engine of growth’) apart from upgrading the macroeconomic stability of the country and the international market access

### End of Tamil nationalism? Not according to the numbers

*2024-11-22 00:55:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/End-of-Tamil-nationalism-Not-according-to-the-numbers/14-769523) · `en`

An analysis of Sri Lankan election data highlights a collapse of many Government affiliated parties and reveals why Tamil nationalism might be growing – not shrinking

The 2024 Sri Lankan Parliamentary election concluded last week, in which the ruling National People’s Power (NPP) gained a record majority and made headway into the Tamil homeland. There were notable casualties for senior Tamil nationalist politicians and for the first time ever a southern political party managed to gain a majority in all but one district in the north-east. Commentators have since speculated whether the result spells the beginning of the end for Tamil nationalist politics.

N

🟩

Today is a special day in our Parliament. The authority was handed over to both groups. Our side has empowered the last presidential election. It is important in the history of Sri Lanka.Most MPs have been selected in our country's electoral system. All the provinces and people have contributed to it as the North and East.

Political parties have been formed on the basis of provinces, nationalism and religions for so long. So the separation, doubt and racism were strengthened between people. When racism is strengthened on one side, racism will be strengthened against it. Racism will not be in the same place. We have seen the history of it in our country, politics and society. But we thank all the people who believe in us.

There are people who believe in other parties without trusting us. That is democracy. It is not democratic to create people's activities surrounding a single party.
