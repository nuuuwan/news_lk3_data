    "Minister of Labour & Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara has raised concerns about the repeated\u00a0SriLankan Airlines flight delays owing to which local migrant workers who were supposed to depart for employment opportunities in South Korea are unable to reach their destination on time.",
    "On Tuesday (June 20), a group of 52 Sri Lankan migrant workers could not board flight UL 470 to reach Incheon, South Korea, due to a 12-hour delay.",
    "The flight was scheduled to take off at 8.50 p.m. from the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake, however, it had suffered a technical error.",
    "Speaking on the matter, Minister Nanayakkara said the Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE) had made all necessary arrangements to send this 800th group of workers for South Korean jobs.",
    "However, the South Korean Human Resources Department has informed the SLBFE not to dispatch the group on Tuesday.",
    "A similar incident was reported in May, after a SriLankan Airlines flight was delayed by 10 hours, and the South Korean Human Resources Department refused to accept a group of Sri Lankan migrant workers who were unable to reach Incheon as planned, Minister Nanayakkara explained.",
    "Although this group of migrant workers was later sent to South Korea on June 04, the flight they had boarded that day, too, had experienced a delay of nearly two hours, he said further."
