### Sri Lanka struggles with high poultry feed costs amid maize trade controls

*2024-10-21 01:34:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-struggles-with-high-poultry-feed-costs-amid-maize-trade-controls-184263/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka is trying to find a solution to high costs of poultry feed amid import duties and trade controls for maize, which is keeping eggs and meat prices high, in a country which has high child malnutrition.

To give unusually high profits to maize farmers and maize collectors, generally called the ‘maize mafia’, Sri Lanka has not only imposed 25 rupees a kilo import taxes (about 86 dollars a tonne), but also imposes quantity restrictions through a license raj.

As a result, license holders can control prices even if imports are allowed.

Sri Lanka recently issued licenses to import 300,000 tonnes of maize, as the Yala season harvests is usually low. Sri Lanka has also banned the use of rice for animal feed.

“About 300,000 tonnes of imports were allowed, but it is on a quota system,” Minister Vijitha Herath said.

“Many people are saying maize can be imported for about 110 rupees a kilo (about 376 dollars a tonne), but it is sold at about 160 rupees (about 547 dollars a tonne).

### Why two-third majority for NPP?

*2024-10-20 23:02:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-two-third-majority-for-NPP/4-768190) · `en`

A supportive parliament with two-third majority for NPP is an absolute must for the new regime to translate its promises into action

AKD expects his JVP-led NPP to win a majority of seats in the legislature to make his task easier. The question is whether that majority should be a simple working majority or a solid two-third majority. Disastrous consequences under governments that ruled with two-third majority in the past had provoked political pundits and opinion makers to question the wisdom of electing governments with two-third majority. Without questioning their wisdom however, a special case could be argued in favour of such a majority to the regime (the terminology is employed neutrally) headed by President AKD.

Unlike the traditional political parties that have operated under a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” arrangement, the NPP under President AKD stands independent, promising nothing but results for the people. The parties that have suffered crushing defeats are now devoid of manifestos or visions, as they have plundered the nation’s resources and sold off valuable assets. It is crucial that the public be vigilant in casting their votes, ensuring that corrupt individuals do not return to power
