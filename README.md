In a significant development the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Kaushalya Nawaratna, has temporarily stepped down from his position pending the conclusion of an investigation into alleged financial irregularities within the BASL. This decision comes in response to growing pressure and concerns regarding the alleged misappropriation of funds earmarked for an anti-corruption initiative funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

The controversy erupted when a group of legal professionals, including 10 Presidents’ Counsel and over 80 Attorneys-at-Law, called for a comprehensive investigation into the JICA project scandal. They demanded that any BASL member potentially involved in the misuse of funds step down during the inquiry. The group highlighted the paramount importance of transparency, accountability, and the preservation of BASL’s moral authority and public trust.

Tensions are rising among fishermen in Mullaitivu as Government authorities allegedly continue to fail to stop illegal fishing by fishermen from other provinces, leading to the risk of a major conflict in the region.

Fishermen from outer provinces have been accused of using prohibited gear to fish in the Mullaitivu sea, depleting resources and threatening the livelihoods of local fishermen. This has prompted the Jaffna District Fishermen’s Cooperative Society Vice President, Antonipillai Francis Ratnakumar, to issue a stern warning during a protest held on 10 June in front of the Mullaitivu District Secretariat.

### AKD’s speech on police and rule of law: Merits and demerits

*2024-06-12 23:03:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-s-speech-on-police-and-rule-of-law-Merits-and-demerits/4-762997) · `en`

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s (AKD) speech as the Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) at the National Convention organised by the Retired Police Officers Collective on 9 June 2024 is quite promising in terms of establishing or reestablishing rule of law in the country, if they get the opportunity to govern the nation. They have been talking about a ‘system change’ now for some time, and various independent critics and observers were asking the details of this promise, without merely depending on the slogan.

I was fortunate to listen to this speech online and live, through ‘Horawa News,’ and one weakness or wrong that I immediately observed was its leading phrase ‘Malimawa shows its police power.’ I have no idea about who runs the ‘Horawa,’ but that was not what AKD was quite obviously advocating. ‘Power’ is not a good word to use in democracy, worst still is the ‘police power.’

‘Is There Another Way? Debt Restructuring, the IMF and the Future of Sri Lanka’, was the title and topic of the most educative, enlightening public policy event of this year. Organised by Yukthi a newish civic association spearheaded by Ahilan Kadirgamar, Ermiza Tegal and Melanie Gunatilleke, it featured three top-notch international economists, Prof. Jayati Ghosh, Prof. Martin Guzman --former Economics Minister of Argentina-- and Charles Abugre. (https://www.youtube.com/live/3SF2L0nh_l4?si=G7D82fcNI2YSxu5A)

Watching the video, my wife Sanja and I had the same thought: these experts and not Lazard et al, should be our advisors on debt restructuring and consultants on our negotiating team, and our negotiating team should certainly not be the current one.

My key takeaways from what Ghosh, Guzman and Abugre said were:

Each country must do its own expert research rather than blindly accept the IMF narrative.

Sri Lanka will start talks on a free trade agreement with Malaysia, as it seeks to improve trade ties to support its recovery from a financial crisis, the Cabinet spokesperson said on Wednesday.

A severe dollar drought in 2022 sent Sri Lanka’s inflation soaring to a high of 70%, its currency into freefall and caused the economy to contract by 7.3%.

To help buttress recovery, Sri Lanka entered negotiations with multiple countries on free trade deals, inking one with Thailand in February.

“We need to promote stronger trade to move out of this crisis and Malaysia has strong ties with Sri Lanka to assist in this process,” said Sri Lanka’s Cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunawardana.

Trade between Malaysia and Sri Lanka was worth US$934 million dollars in 2023, according to official data.

Sri Lanka exports mainly gems, garments and fish to Malaysia, and imports palm oil, petroleum products and fertilisers.

### Sri Lanka president needs referendum to extend his tenure: Justice Minister

*2024-06-12 17:45:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-president-needs-referendum-to-extend-his-tenure-justice-minister-167709/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe will need a referendum if he needs to extend his tenure by one year despite an error in the constitution’s 19th amendment when it was passed in 2015, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

Speculations have been on rise that the island nation’s constitution could allow President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by one year due to a mistake in the constitution, which was approved with more than two-third majority.

While all references to the six-year terms of both the president and parliament were changed to five years in line with the 19th Amendment, Article 83(b) was overlooked and left unchanged, giving a loophole to extend his term for President Wickremesinghe.

However, Minister Rajapakshe said despite an inconsistency, the rulers need both two-third majority and referendum to change 9 clauses in the constitution which also include the people’s voting right.

At the 1903 congress of the RSDLP, point 9 of the party’s programme addressed the national question, sparking a heated debate that resulted in numerous clarifications. Since then, various debates and discussions have ensued among the left on this issue, with the Leninist position enduring various historical challenges.
