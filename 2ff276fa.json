    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has raised concerns about the quality of pharmaceutical products procured for Sri Lanka\u2019s public healthcare system and persistent shortages of essential medicines.",
    "While the shortage of essential medicines has stemmed from the economic crisis, it persists due to the lack of a robust and transparent procurement system, the Chamber said in a statement on Monday July 17.",
    "\u201cWe recommend that swift action be taken to ensure and enhance the public procurement of medicines in a transparent manner which requires registration with the regulator following approved and established guidelines,\u201d it said.",
    "The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) must play a much stronger, transparent, and independent role in ensuring that high-quality medicines are procured, including essential medicines that are procured through an emergency process, the statement said.",
    "The NMRA said in early July that it can consider allowing the import of drugs with a shelf life below nine months to ease recurring shortages.",
    "Drugs with a shelf life below \u201c75 percent of a year\u201d were not cleared by Sri Lanka Customs at the point of import due to an NMRA regulation, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwelle had said addressing a tri-monthly summit held on 30 June.",
    "\u201cDepending on the supply, gaps, urgency or stock levels, we might consider lower percentages, so that is up to NMRA,\u201d Gunesekara said.",
    "Sri Lanka regulator may consider shorter shelf life drugs to ease shortage: OfficialSee more",
    "The pricing of medicines should also adopt a market pricing formula developed by relevant experts similar to that adopted for other commodities such as fuel and gas that were previously subject to price controls. A pricing formula will ensure sustainability in the quality of medicines procured, the Chamber said.",
    "\u201cWe recognise the recent directive of the president to streamline the procurement system. The Ceylon Chamber along with its affiliated associations and professional bodies such as the Sri Lanka Medical Association stand ready to support the policymakers in improving and uplifting the current state of the healthcare system that will benefit the people of the country,\u201d it said.
