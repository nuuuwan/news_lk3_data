*2024-11-29 06:36:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/203849) · `si`

නිරිතදිග බෙංගාල බොක්ක මුහුදු ප්‍රදේශයේ පවතින ගැඹුරු පීඩන අවපාතය අද (29) දිනයෙන් පසු දිවයිනේ කාලගුණයට සිදුවෙන බලපෑම ක්‍රමයෙන් අවම වනු ඇතැයි බලාපොරොත්තු වෙයි.

### Vigneswaran to push recognition of North and East as Tamil speaking regions

*2024-11-29 02:19:21* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Vigneswaran-to-push-recognition-of-North-and-East-as-Tamil-speaking-regions/56-769883) · `en`

Former Northern Province Chief Minister and Tamil Makkal Thesiya Kootani (TMTK) party leader C. V. Vigneswaran PC has announced plans to form an alliance of Tamil nationalist parties aimed at securing official recognition of the Northern and Eastern provinces as Tamil-speaking regions.

The National People’s Power (NPP) emerged as a key player, winning substantial support across the North and East, signalling a shift in the political dynamics of the area.

Speaking to the media this week, Vigneswaran confirmed that discussions are underway among parties committed to Tamil nationalism to establish a unified front. “This alliance is being formed to press the Government to formally recognise the North and East as Tamil-speaking regions,” he said.

### සුරතල් සතුන් හරහා ආ හැකි 'මාරයාගෙන්' ඔබේ දරුවා ආරක්ෂා කර ගන්නේ කෙසේ ද?

*2024-11-29 01:30:30* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c4gxn2xjx3no) · `si`

සුරතල් සතුන් හරහා ආ හැකි 'මාරයාගෙන්' ඔබේ දරුවා ආරක්ෂා කර ගන්නේ කෙසේ ද?

සුරතල් සතුන් මානසික ආතතිය, කාන්සිය ඇතුළු මානසික තත්ත්වයන්ට විසඳුමක් වන බව පිළිගැනුණ ද, ඇතැම් විට ඔවුන් හරහා කුඩා දරුවන් අනතුරට පත්වන අවස්ථා ද විරල නොවේ.

මීට සතියකට පමණ ඉහතදී ගාල්ල, නෙළුව ප්‍රදේශයේ 7 හැවිරිදි දරුවෙකුගේ දිවි අහිමි වීමට කුඩා බලු පැටවෙකු හරහා පැමිණි ජලභීතිකා වෛරසය හේතු විය.

ආගන්තුක ලෙස නිවසට පැමිණි බලු පැටවෙකු අදාළ නිවසේ සිට ඇති අතර, දින කිහිපයකින් පසු එම බලු පැටවා අතුරුදහන් වී තිබිණි.

එම සිදුවීමෙන් මාස දෙකකට පමණ පසුව උණ රෝගය වැළඳී ගාල්ල, කරාපිටිය ශික්ෂණ රෝහලට ඇතුළත් කළ දරුවාට නැවත නිවසට පැමිණීමට ජලභිතිකා වෛරසය ඉඩ දී තිබුණේ නැත.

නිවසට පැමිණි ආගන්තුක බලු පැටවාගෙන්, දරුවාට ජලභීතිකා රෝගය ආසාදනය වී ඇති බවට වෛද්‍යවරුන් සැක පළ කරන අතර, බලු පැටවා දරුවා සූරා තිබූ බවට, වෛද්‍යවරුන් රෝග නිධානය සොයාගන්නා තුරු දෙමාව්පියන් දැනුවත් වී තිබුණේ නැත.

### Rise of digital campaigning: How social platforms shaped Sri Lanka’s elections

*2024-11-29 01:06:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Rise-of-digital-campaigning-How-social-platforms-shaped-Sri-Lanka-s-elections/14-769865) · `en`

Of all social platforms, TikTok played a significant role in ensuring election integrity

The recent Presidential and General elections in Sri Lanka marked a significant political shift, with Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People’s Power (NPP) coalition emerging as a transformative figure. Dissanayake’s victory in the September 2024 Presidential election represented a break from decades of entrenched elite politics, resonating with voters disillusioned by corruption and economic mismanagement. NPP’s subsequent landslide win in the snap Parliamentary elections solidified his mandate to pursue reforms to alleviate poverty and address systemic governance issues.

### Systems change expected  by the people from NPP Government

*2024-11-29 01:03:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Systems-change-expected-by-the-people-from-NPP-Government/4-769864) · `en`

The Government has already formed a relevant ministry and well-qualified advisers in the field. This is a good positive starting point. The people have yet to see the change in this regard. The NPP Government should also encourage the industries that encourage the creation of jobs, especially for young people, by supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and offering vocational training programs. The curriculum of the technical colleges should be overhauled, and relevant job-orientated vocational training should be further developed

The NPP, which has become a major political force in the most recent Parliamentary election in Sri Lanka, has presented a vision for system change that many people find appealing.

### Will NPP Govt. probe killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera?

*2024-11-29 00:50:26* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Will-NPP-Govt-probe-killing-of-JVP-leader-Rohana-Wijeweera/4-769853) · `en`

Given the enormity of the violence caused by the JVP and the boiling anger among the police and security personnel towards the JVP leader, it was widely believed that Rohana Wijeweera was killed in what was euphemistically termed as an “officially sanctioned unofficial execution”

Rohana Wijeweera was killed 35 years ago on 13 November 1989. The revolutionary leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna was 46 years old at the time of his death. The mastermind behind two bloody insurrections – in 1971 and from 1987 to 89 – was taken into custody on 12 November in the Kandy District and brought to Colombo. With Wijeweera’s capture and death the second JVP insurgency gradually petered out and ended

### Public support for Govt: Key for successful IMF programs

Both the IMF and the Government officials should keep in mind that maintaining broad public support is as important as implementing necessary reforms

The new Government and the IMF have so far been in sync. For instance, the IMF underscored the importance of securing funding for social spending and supporting the most vulnerable. President Dissanayake has assured that his Government would prioritise effective use of social funds, focusing on combating child poverty, addressing malnutrition, and improving support for differently-abled individuals. These priorities, core to the NPP’s election platform, demonstrate at least some levels of alignment between the Government’s goals and IMF conditions. The mutual emphasis on social spending would also help the Government maintain its strong popularity

On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, marking the start of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, UNFPA Asia-Pacific Regional Director Pio Smith calls for urgent action to close the digital gender divide, hold tech platforms accountable, and invest in inclusive policies to combat online gender-based violence, creating safer digital spaces for all women and girls.

The internet has revolutionised our lives, offering unprecedented opportunities for connection, learning and empowerment. Yet, the digital revolution has a sinister side: the growing threat of technology-facilitated gender-based violence. A recent global study found that nearly 60% of women had experienced one or more forms of online harm. For millions of women and girls, digital spaces are fraught with risks that echo and amplify the violence they already face offline.
