    "In preparation for the Parliamentary Election slated for 14 November, the Election Commission of Sri Lanka yesterday announced the official spending limits for candidates, political parties, independent groups, and national list candidates. The limits, which vary by district, are part of newly implemented campaign finance laws aimed at regulating election spending.",
    "According to the Commission\u2019s announcement, the Colombo District has the highest expenditure limits. Candidates can spend up to Rs. 5,750,000, while political parties or independent groups have a cap of Rs. 79,493 756. National list candidates in Colombo are allowed to spend Rs. 34,694 on their campaigns.",
    "Meanwhile, the Gampaha District follows closely, with candidates permitted to spend a maximum of Rs. 5,643,387, and political parties or independent groups can allocate up to Rs. 81,735,055. National list candidates in Gampaha have a spending limit of Rs. 35,667.",
    "At the other end of the spectrum, the Vanni District has the lowest expenditure limits. Candidates in this district can spend up to Rs. 1,673,243 while political parties or independent groups are capped at Rs. 9, 913,964. National list candidates in Vanni can only spend Rs. 4,327.",
    "The Election Commission emphasised that all candidates and political entities must submit detailed reports of their campaign spending to the Commission within 21 days of the election results being declared. The reports need to be signed by the party secretary, independent group leader, or candidates themselves, and must be certified by a Commissioner for Oaths or a Justice of the Peace.",
    "The new campaign finance regulations are a significant shift in Sri Lankan election protocols, with the goal of ensuring transparency and fairness in the political process. These limits were finalised after discussions with various stakeholders which allowed the Commission to gather feedback and suggestions on establishing spending thresholds.",
    "In addition to regular voting, postal voting for the Parliamentary election will be held on 30 October, 1 and 4 November across all district secretariats and election commission offices."
