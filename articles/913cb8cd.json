    "\u201cIt means street foods, bars which are being kept opened because now wine stores are opened till 10 o clock in the night instead of 9 o clock. Restaurant bars are allowed to be opened till 2 in the morning specially in the five-star hotels. But previously everybody had to shut at 11 o clock all the bars everywhere.\u201d",
    "The idea is to improve the tax revenue through night time dining and entertainment, particularly from excise duties.",

    "\u201cActually we should have more open events like concerts, we should have malls and shops opened till very late in the night, because people like to do shopping in the night,\u201d she said when asked for her future plans to increase night time economic activities.",
    "\u201cIf you go to Singapore, we know there are shops opened till late in the night. If Sri Lanka is a tourism hub, we have to have them. I could prefer to have it 24 hours.\u201d (Colombo/April 29/2024)"
