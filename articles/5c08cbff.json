    "As the sun rises over the mountains surrounding the Magastota Estate in Nuwara Eliya, G.P.D. Padmakanthi, a dedicated midwife with over 35 years of experience, is making her way to visit",
    "a mother who is expecting her second baby. As a midwife, Padmakanthi has been a constant source of strength and guidance for the estate communities in Nuwara Eliya, located in the",
    "Central Province of Sri Lanka. Not only has she assisted in countless births for many, but has also been a guiding light for mothers, families, children, and youth in the estate sector facing",
    "various challenges, in accessing general services and facilities readily available for others in society.",
    "As we mark the International Day of the Midwife today (May 5th), Padmakanthi\u2019s journey is a testament to the power of compassion, resilience, and dedication of midwives \u2013 a vital source of strength for any mother bringing new life into our world.",
    "Midwives save lives. Well-trained midwives could help avert roughly two thirds of all maternal and newborn deaths. Since 2008, UNFPA has worked with partners, governments and policymakers to help build a competent, well-trained and well-supported midwifery workforce in low-resource settings. UNFPA Sri Lanka partners with organizations engaging with communities that support women, girls, young people and communities to access healthcare services, including information and services on sexual and reproductive health.",
    "\u201cI have devoted 35 years to midwifery. I\u2019m dedicated to providing comprehensive healthcare services, including reproductive health and family planning, as well as offering support and education to newlyweds and mothers. Regular home visits are a crucial part of my work to improve healthcare accessibility and serve my community better.\u201d",
    "It was in 1987 that Padmakanthi began her midwifery journey, shortly after completing her ordinary level education. Despite being aware of the language barriers, as the estate",
    "community primarily converses in Tamil, she was drawn to the opportunity to serve the healthcare needs of this marginalized minority. Her determination to serve the communities around her drove her to learn Tamil through self-study, enabling her to connect more deeply with the communities she served. Today, she can read, write and speak fluently in Tamil and Sinhala.",
    "\u201cEffective communication in the local language has allowed me to connect with people on a deeper level, earning their trust and facilitating better healthcare outcomes. I attribute my continued service in this field to the quality of service I\u2019ve provided to my community, by being able to connect with the people.\u201d",
    "While she could have secured a placement to serve in a predominantly Sinhala speaking area, Padmakanthi took on the challenge to offer her dedicated midwifery service to the estate",
    "\u201cI used to visit expecting mothers at their homes, on a regular basis to ensure they have everything they need and are healthy during their pregnancy. Over time, through education and outreach efforts, we\u2019ve witnessed a significant shift towards hospital- based childbirth and increased clinic attendance.\u201d",
    "Reflecting on her career in the estate sector, Padmakanthi shares, \u201cWhen I began my career, home deliveries were very common among this community, reflecting a lack of access to healthcare facilities\u201d.\u00a0 Despite these challenges, she worked tirelessly to ensure that expecting mothers were prepared for childbirth, providing maternity kits, and even accompanying them to hospitals when needed. Explaining her routine engagements with the expectant mothers in the community, she says, \u201cI make home visits to these women and monitor a wide range of factors, such as nutrition, breastfeeding, family planning, and personal hygiene. During these visits, I also discuss income management ahead of the baby\u2019s arrival. What should be bought and in what order of priority.\u201d",
    "Her efforts have contributed to a significant shift towards hospital-based childbirth and increased clinic attendance. \u201cI\u2019m proud to share with you that there have only been three",
    "home-deliveries during my 21-years of service in this Magastota Estate. I made sure to encourage mothers to visit clinics regularly and to visit the hospital for delivery,\u201d she noted. It is her strong belief that improved awareness and community engagement have facilitated this behavioral transformation of visiting the hospital to give birth, resulting in better maternal and child health outcomes.",
    "\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve received national recognition for my contributions as a midwife. I ranked third in Southeast Asia for my efforts to combat low birth weight issues in Nuwara Eliya. I have faced numerous challenges throughout this journey, but my dedication to serving my community remains unwavering\u201d",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Padmakanthi\u2019s dedication to her community remained unwavering. She and her team worked around the clock, implementing stringent measures among the estate communities to safeguard against the virus. Despite numerous services and functions coming to a standstill across the country, her team provided essential supplies, continued with home visits, and achieved a 100% vaccination rate among the targeted population.",
    "The subsequent multidimensional crisis presented new challenges, but Padmakanthi\u2019s resourcefulness and proactive nature enabled the community to withstand the difficult times ahead.",
    "\u201cWe grew sweet potatoes and maize. We had a good harvest and didn\u2019t miss a single meal during the crisis period. We were well prepared to face the economic crisis\u201d she said. By embracing resilience and fostering unity among the community, she was able to navigate these challenging times successfully within her community.",
    "Padmakanthi\u2019s commitment to her work and community extends beyond her professional life. Her daughter, Kavya, was born in 1998 during her service to the community as a midwife.",
    "While carrying her daughter and having been advised by her doctor to take bed rest due to medical complications, Padmakanthi assisted a crucial delivery for a pregnant mother who was facing a life and death situation. \u201cAfter the delivery and sending the mother and the baby to the ward, I felt dizzy, and my vision was blurring. I was immediately subjected to some tests,",
    "and they found that I had high blood pressure. I was told that a caesarian must be performed, although I was only at seven months,\u201d she explained in detail the situation that ensued soon after",
    "performing her duties as a midwife for a mother who was in labour. Padmakanthi gave birth to her.",
    "To this day, alongside her work as a midwife, she advocates for the rights of children with special needs. \u201cI\u2019m known for my significant contribution to enhancing community health, particularly within the estate community. At the same time, I focus on identifying and meeting the unique needs of special children, ensuring they receive appropriate support to",
    "live fulfilling lives. My goal is to advocate for these children\u2019s rights and ensure they\u2019re treated equally,\u201d she emphasized. Today, Kavya shares her mother\u2019s passion for healthcare, creating her own path towards the collective mission of serving the people. Padmakanthi\u2019s continued commitment to providing her daughter with the utmost care and support as a child with special needs, has empowered her to face life\u2019s challenges head on whilst assisting the people to the best of her ability.",
