    "We do not have adequate buses and trains in our public transport system, particularly in suburban areas. Hence, motorcycle population has increased tremendously. There are 4,840,000 registered motorcycles in Sri Lanka; i.e. almost 1/3 of the adult population own a motorcycle.",
    "Most children travel in Motorbikes with their parents due to convenience. Although, many parents wear helmets to simply abide by traffic laws, they do not provide helmets for their children. AA Ceylon conducted a campaign \u201cSafer Ride for All\u201d in 2014 with a FIA Grant programme to educate and influence motorcyclists to wear helmets. This campaign was successfully concluded with the support of the National Council for Road Safety, Ministry of Transport, Department of Police, Colombo Municipal Council and motorcycle enthusiasts. Today, due to strict enforcement of traffic laws, over 98% of adults riding motorbikes wear helmets.",
    "Need of the hour is to educate parents on the importance of providing a helmet for their children; not just to abide by the law, but for the sake of their children\u2019s safety. 2515 deaths were reported through road accidents in 2022. Motorcycle accidents accounted for 5,133 people who sustained disabilities along with 806 deaths, 411 of them being children. The World Bank reveals an average of 38,000 crashes annually in Sri Lanka, resulting in around 3,000 deaths and 8,000 serious injuries. They also indicated that over US $ 2 billion additional investments are needed to combat road safety issues.",
    "Stage 1 of this project will aim at educating parents and all motorcycle riders on the importance of providing a helmet to every child accompanied on a motorcycle. The Traffic Police would initially allow a grace period for parents to provide helmets for their kids. Meanwhile, the Traffic Police; Authorities in all relevant ministries; Doctors; Teachers; Parents; Students and all motorcycle enthusiasts are expected to be involved in educating the public on \u201cWhy every child needs a helmet?\u201d.",
    "Stage 2 of the project aims at encouraging Police officers to impose fines on motor traffic regulatory violations.",
    "The gazette notification was issued by the Transport and Highways Minister on July 7, 2022, under Section 158 of the Motor Traffic Act. According to the notification,\u00a0every person who rides a motorcycle, along with the pillion on any road should wear a protective helmet (with or without a visor). Nevertheless, no action has been taken against parents who risk their children\u2019s lives on motorbikes, mainly due to sympathy factors.",
    "With the assistance of the authorities from National Council for Road Safety, Ministry of Transport, Department of Police, The Lady Ridgeway Hospital, National Child Protection Authority, Ministry of Education, Lions Club of Hendala and Corporates, we wish to address this national issue and force every motorcycle rider accompanying children to provide \u2018a safer helmet for kids\u2019 to protect the future generation of Mother Lanka.",
