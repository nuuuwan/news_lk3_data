    "The city centre hotel, where the late Queen Elizabeth II dined in 2010, which earned the head chef her personal thanks, has 38 individually designed ensuite bedrooms. It is a Victorian property that previously served as a police station and also as council headquarters.",

We look forward to capitalising on the existing reputation of the hotel whilst putting our own stamp on it.\u201d"
