    "The Little Minds Strong Values (LMSV), Rotary Honda Purudu Championship Season 03 finals were held last Sunday, 28 April at Galadari Hotel and broadcast on Facebook live.",
    "Over 4,000 children from around the country participated in the competition and 125 children participated in the finals.",
    "This project was initiated by the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan and over the past six years expanded as a project that has been adopted by all clubs across the Rotary 3220 District. Rotary believes that inculcating good ethics and values in children at a young age would bring about a positive change in the country in the next generation. LMSV uses 32 Sinhala/Tamil songs with simple music/lyrics and eye-catching video animation to promote positive ideas and attitudes in children from a young age, building and shaping the citizens of the future. The famous idiom \u201cPuhul Hora Karen Dane\u201d is turned into a song with a powerful message to the children \u201cHora karanna epa\u201d, \u201cboru kiyanna epa\u201d, and similarly all songs have powerful messages and embedded values in them.",

It brings me great joy to witness their embodiment of the values embedded in our songs, as they deliver creative performances. Over the past six years, we have developed more than 50 Honda Purudu values, imparting moral guidance to children on various aspects of life such as respect, kindness, honesty, and environmental stewardship.\u201d",
