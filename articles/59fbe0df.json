    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling Marxists-leaned National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has never said to change the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) and only said it will discuss on a new DSA, Deputy Minister of Industries Chathuranga Abeysinghe told the parliament on Wednesday.",
    "Abeysinghe revealed this when opposition legislator Dayasiri Jayasekera accused the government of implementing policies contrary to what was promised before the elections.",
    "\u201cWe have clearly said in our policy document that we will put forward a new DSA for discussion and we never said that we will change the current DSA,\u201d Abeysinghe said.",
    "The ruling NPP has been continuing most of the IMF-led economic reforms despite its members criticizing them during the election campaigns.",
    "Critics have said any drastic change in the current reforms could end up in delays of bilateral and commercial debt restructuring as well as delays in the disbursement of the IMF tranche, which is vital for investor confidence. (Colombo/December 04/2024)"
