    "Ceylon\u2019s native medicinal practitioners did not all come from a single social class anymore than did her astrologers. I can remember that, in my childhood days, a man named Punchi Rala, who cultivated a paddy field owned by my family, prescribed medicines for the commoner ailments. On the other hand, there was the Veda Menike, a female relative of mine, the daughter of an Adigar, who apart from being a competent ayurvedic doctor, had a good knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit and was at home with ola manuscripts.",
    "Living in Kurunegala town at the beginning of the 20th century, we also had a family doctor who came with his shiny instruments in a buggy cart. There were, as far as I can remember, two motor cars in Kurunegala at the time. Neither the doctor or any member of my family possessed one.",
    "If as boys we were interested in a medical career, we wished to be doctors and not vederalas. Although the majority of people at that time still resorted to traditional cures, the efficacy of western drugs and surgery was making itself felt. Quinine mixture stopped malaria. Sores were cured by boric powder and zinc oxide.",
    "The steep rise in the expectation of life and the alleviation of pain proved the superiority of western science over the hidebound ayurvedic system. The preparation of decoctions involved time and labour. Swallowing a pill was easier than making up a concoction of leaves, bark, roots, flowers and fruit of medicinal plants.",
    "One cannot but marvel at the amount of knowledge a modern doctor carries in his head and the confidence he inspires in a patient. When we hear of a \u201cdoctor\u201d in ordinary conversation, we are not thinking of a doctor of any other discipline than that of medicine. We reserve the label for the family friend.",
    "Why has the Ayurvedic system stood still while western medicine has advanced by leaps and bounds? The reason is that the traditional system has depended on outdated books, unscientific methods and astrology whereas the western system has relied on research, rigorous training and experience. The vederalas are often shrewd and competent in their own limited sphere which is why they are successful.",
    "Western physicians are now turning a more kindly eye on traditional remedies. An eminent doctor who was a school-mate of mine told me the other day that there were effective cures for bowel diseases such as pomegranate for dysentery. Bee\u2019s honey is prescribed in the West as never before. There is said to be a world shortage of bee\u2019s honey as a result. This suggests a promising industry for countries such as Ceylon which has an abundance of flowers at all times of the year.",
    "I have recently been amusing myself by collecting the names of plants commonly used in indigenous medicine because I am interested in plants and many of the medicinal plants grow in my own garden and on the side of public drains quite unsuspected by me. I was familiar from my childhood with trees such as ehela, kohomba, na, beli, aralu, and delun; and herbs that are to be found everywhere: gotukola, rasakinda, kuppameniya, udupiyali, genda, tampala, nivithi, wada-mal mugunuwanna and sarana.",
    "I wish I had been taught botany in school instead of chemistry and physics from books. In my old age I have surrounded myself with books on the medicinal plants: Dr. John Attygalle (1917), Professor Chandrasena (1933), H.F. MacMillan (1935) and J.F. Dastur\u2019s \u201cEverybody\u2019s Guide to Ayurvedic Medicine\u201d. From the last-named I have discovered that the ayurvedic system, like much else we have, came to Ceylon from India, and that more than half the list of trees and herbs used in medicine are common to India and Ceylon.",
    "The word ayurvedic is derived from `ayur\u2019 (period of living) and `veda\u2019 (to know). Fragments only of the earliest manuscripts are now extant. The original were supposed, no doubt, apocryphically to have been left by Brahma in 900 BC and copies were handed down to the Buddhists by the Brahmans.",
    "Medicine was one of the four sciences which in ancient times every Sinhalese of gentle birth was expected to know. King Buddhadasa who reigned from Anuradhapura in the fifth century AD, composed, according to the Mahavamsa, a well-known medical book called the \u2018Saratha Sangrahava\u2019. King Parakrama. Bahu the Great was no mean student and practitioner of Ayurveda.",
    "There is not a great deal of information about the medical services during the Portuguese and Dutch occupation of a part of Ceylon. Some of the Dutch physicians were noted for their knowledge of botany. The flora of Ceylon was arranged and described by the Swede, Linnaeus (1707-1778) with the aid of the celebrated herbaria collected by Herman and Hartos, both of whom were sent out to the tropics by the Dutch East India Company in 1671.",
    "The vitality of the Ayurvedic system in Ceylon does not seem to have been crushed by the western treatment introduced by the European colonists. This is not surprising since many of the western drugs were of vegetable origin.",
    "Taking an example from Dr. John Attygalle\u2019s Sinhalese Materia Medica, we can see the multi-purpose efficacy of some of the plants. Of Rasakinda (Tamil: Shindil-kodi) he writes \u201cit is one of the most valued and frequently used drugs among the native medical men. It is regarded as a tonic and alterative, and is used in general debility, fever. jaundice, skin diseases. rheumaticism, urinary diseases, inability of the stomach, and. in short, there is hardly a disease in which it is not employed in combination with other drugs.\u201d",
    "Dr. Emmanuel Roberts says of Raskinda in the course of a longish article that it is a climbing plant with stems rising to a great height. The leaves are astringent because of the tanin they contain. The bruised fresh fruit mixed with cow ghee are applied to burns and scalds with great effect. The stem, when taken internally, acts as a bitter tonic stimulating the appetite and improving the digestion, and is useful in anorexia, atonic dyspepsia and in convalescence from acute diseases. Dr. Roberts continues in this strain, and gives several preparations of the drug as extracts.",
    "H.F. MacMillan in his \u201cTropical Planting and Gardening\u201d states briefly: \u201cRasakinda; Twiner Leaves and bark used in fever, skin diseases, jaundice, and syphilis.\u201d I should perhaps start with the",
    "decoction of first resort in fever, colds, coughs and sore throats, namely, inguru Koththamalli (ginger and coriander). Ginger we always meet, whether well or ill: ginger beer, ginger ale, ginger nuts, ginger chocolates, ginger syrup, ginger pop, ginger brandy etc. There are many other versatile plants and herbs like ginger and coriander.",
    "As I look round my small garden, I admire, the Ehela tree (cassia fistula), a beautiful object when in blossom, bearing masses of yellow flowers in pendulous racemes and the na tree (ironwood) which is now bearing large white flowers, each with its large bunch of yellow stamens, delicately scented. The young leaves which twice a year are deep crimson. In a corner stands a well-trimmed travellers\u2019 palm.",
    "Yes, plants can be a wonderful companion when we realize that we must live with them and by them, and that they are there for the asking. One of the first things which attracted me during a visit to Palestine 40 years ago were the citrus plantations. On my return I started to grow citrus with imported grafts but it was not a success. But why bother when there are so many other interesting plants that suit our climate and our soil? Nature has been bountiful to us.",
