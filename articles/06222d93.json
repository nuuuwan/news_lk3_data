    "Earlier today, Minister Gunawardene had stated that letters have been sent to all railway employees who participated in the strike notifying them that they are considered to have vacated their respective positions.",
    "He had stated that the General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways has sent letters informing all Station Masters who have not reported to duties and are engaged in the strike that they are considered to have vacated their positions.",
    "The General Manager of Railways had previously warned that all Station Masters and Railway Controllers who fail to report to duty by 12.00 noon yesterday (10) would be considered as having vacated their positions.",
