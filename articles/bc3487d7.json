  "original_body_lines": [
    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has become a polarizing figure in Sri Lanka as the country grapples with a deep economic crisis. The austerity measures proposed by the IMF, aimed at addressing the nation\u2019s debt burden, have sparked widespread discontent among ordinary citizens, said Hemantha Withanage, Chair of Friends of the International, a large network of grassroots environmental organizations from 74 countries.",
    "Withanage added that the roles of the IMF and the World Bank in Sri Lanka over the past eight decades have been significant but complex. While their contributions to economic stabilization and development are notable, they have also provoked challenges and criticisms regarding social equity and governance.",
    "He stressed that the critical question remains whether the people of Sri Lanka have truly benefited from their long-standing relationship with these institutions\u2014a dilemma that continues to persist.",
    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review, Withanage highlighted that the IMF\u2019s influence in Sri Lanka dates back decades, shaping the country\u2019s economic landscape through financial assistance, policy advice and development projects. However, the recent debt crisis, exacerbated by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, has brought the IMF\u2019s role into sharp focus.",
    "Withanage added: \u2018The IMF\u2019s proposed measures, including tax hikes and spending cuts, have been criticized for disproportionately affecting the poor and vulnerable. Many argue that the government should prioritize debt restructuring and explore alternative avenues for economic recovery rather than imposing harsh austerity measures.",
    "`Despite these challenges, the IMF remains a key player in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic future. The country\u2019s recent agreement with the IMF for a bailout package offers a glimmer of hope, but the road to recovery is likely to be long and arduous. As Sri Lanka navigates these turbulent times, the debate over the IMF\u2019s role and the effectiveness of its policies will continue to shape the country\u2019s economic destiny.",
    "`IMF has become a prominent topic in Sri Lanka due to the austerity measures it proposed to address the country\u2019s debt crisis. These measures have increased taxes for ordinary citizens, while the previous interim government warned that Sri Lanka would face further difficulties if it did not adhere to the IMF package agreed upon in mid-2022.",
    "\u2018The IMF package was a key issue in the recent presidential election, resulting in a significant loss for the interim president, a strong proponent of IMF solutions. The election was won by left-party politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who takes a more measured approach to the IMF.",
    "`Over the past 80 years, IMF and the World Bank involvement in Sri Lanka has included a mix of financial assistance, policy advice, and development projects, significantly influencing the country\u2019s economic trajectory.",
    "\u2018The IMF\u2019s and World Bank\u2019s impact on Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and society has been multifaceted. On the one hand, their financial assistance and development projects have contributed to essential advancements in infrastructure, health, and education. Rural communities have benefited from improved access to basic services and economic policies supported by the IMF have, at times, restored macroeconomic stability.",
    "\u2018On the other hand, the social costs associated with structural adjustment programs and austerity measures have raised concerns. Focus on market-driven policies often overlooked the needs of the most vulnerable populations. Inequality and poverty remain pressing challenges, as the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. Whatever the solutions these spin doctors have given, about 24% of the population became poor due to the debt crisis that began in 2020.",
    "\u2018According to a more recent report by the FAO and the United Nations World Food Programme, it is estimated that 3.9 million people or 17% of the population, are in moderate acute food insecurity. The IMF has trained bureaucrats and politicians to praise its work and seek its advice constantly. Since joining the IMF, Sri Lanka has received assistance at least 16 times. While we\u2019ve addressed some issues, our debt continues to rise, adversely affecting the population.\u2019",
