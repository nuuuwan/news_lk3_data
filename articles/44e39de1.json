    "Approved businesses are expected to use only foreign currencies in the area.",
    "Inside the Port City, Sri Lanka\u2019s bank cannot destroy the future value of money (rupees), create forex shortages or social unrest by printing money to cut rates through aggressive open market operations or unrestrained standing facilities.",
    "Colombo Port City is a multiple currency area free of inflationist \u2018macro-economic\u2019 policy from a money monopoly and its monetary stability will be externally anchored though currency competition.",
    "Products form multiple central banks including the Fed (US dollar), European Central Bank (Euro) and Peoples Bank of China (Yuan) are expected to compete to gain acceptance from its businesses and workers without a coercive legal tender monopoly that compels an inflating currency to be used.",
    "Typically in dollarized areas (like Panama) banks will have arrangements with their holding companies or other US banks for temporary liquidity facilities, leading to strong market regulation as they would not lend to banks which are not well -managed, unlike unrestrained standing facilities.",
    "In some countries with chronic currency deprecation, balance of payments deficits, outmigration by people who see no future for their children in their own country, there is no penalty rate for standing facilities, no counterparty limits and intra-day liquidity has zero interest rates.
