  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition which is now criticizing a tax cut in 2019, especially after a court order, was part of a parliament that endorsed them unanimously, legislator Namal Rajapaksa said in parliament on Monday.",
    "Rajapaksa\u2019s father Mahinda and two uncles, Gotabaya and Basil were faulted by courts for the economic crisis.",
    "The crises was triggered by the most severe deployment of \u2018macro-economic policy\u2019 in the history of the island\u2019s central bank. Two central bank governors who oversaw the money printing and rate cuts were also faulted.",
    "\u201cYou are now opposing taxes, but they were passed unanimously in parliament at that time. None of these political parties opposed it. So we have to ask: are you against lowering taxes for the people of this country today?\u201d",
    "The tax cuts were implemented by the executive before the parliament passed them in \u2018Royal Prerogative\u2019 fashion. (Colombo/Nov20/2023)"
