### Heavenly Duties Or Hellish Efforts?

“The world is what it is, men who are nothing, who allow themselves to be nothing, have no place in it” ~ VS Naipaul

I have a distant memory of reading a light-hearted description of heaven and hell, in common belief an inevitable destination for all earthlings; those who lead unsullied lives are directed to the former; botch your book, the man is hightailed to hell.

These two places are obviously ‘constructs’ of the human imagination, by human standards and outlook, the ecstasies promised and the tortures threatened are not only of human concept but are also distinctly period defined (are there personal computers in either place?). There cannot be two more dissimilar destinations in the after-life, heaven is a joyous place of endless pleasures and creature comforts, while hell is all agony, suffering and torture.

In this piece I read, the definition of heaven and hell was determined by racial differences, stereotyping the occupants in the two places.

### Rediscovering The Good In Religion This Holiday Season

Every day, headlines are filled with words like deposed, disgraced, defrocked, or displaced—often tied to controversies involving religious authorities or the struggles of various religious groups. Even for someone like me, skeptical of religion in general, this overwhelming negativity seems suspiciously one-sided. How could something that so much of humanity believes in be reduced to nothing but conflict and failure?

Before seeking the good in religions, perhaps we must first confront where we’ve gone wrong. It seems evident that many religions have been transformed into tribal factions vying for power and dominance, losing sight of their core purpose: self-improvement, introspection, salvation, and the pursuit of higher ideals. Instead of fostering unity or moral growth, religion has often become a weapon—used to rally against perceived enemies, threaten with damnation, and fortify an “us versus them” mentality.

Amid Sri Lanka’s journey toward economic recovery, Indian investors and businesses are closely monitoring the emerging opportunities in the local market.

Dr. Naresh Bana, Vice Chairman of the Indo-Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ISCCI) shared his perspective recently, on current investment trends, bilateral trade, and collaborative ventures between the two neighbours.

Despite strong tourism ties, Indian investment in Sri Lanka’s tourism sector remains cautious. “Indian investors, like their counterparts elsewhere, rely on credible data, projections, and business prudence,” Dr. Bana explains. The country’s credit rating challenges, influenced by banking and financial institutions, often determine the final investment decisions. However, trading relations between the two nations remain robust.

These perspectives have emboldened Indian fishermen to violate maritime boundaries and destroy marine resources by resorting to bottom trawling

The opportunity presented by the forthcoming visit of President Dissanayake to India should not be missed by the new Government because all previous Governments and their advisors have failed to address this all-important issue, either because of their timidity or ignorance of relevant international laws. If Dissanayake fails to inform India that Sri Lanka has no option but to seek the assistance of the ICJ to resolve the issue of maritime boundaries, Sri Lanka will have to accept the bitter prospect of the plunder of its resources and the sovereign rights of the people and the nation forever

### Heavenly duties or hellish efforts?

The country, once hopeful, stagnates; never achieving a growth rate that promises a break through

“The world is what it is, men who are nothing, who allow themselves to be nothing, have no place in it”   – V.S. Naipaul

I have a distant memory of reading a light-hearted description of heaven and hell, in common belief an inevitable destination for all earthlings; those who lead unsullied lives are directed to the former; botch your book, the man is hightailed to hell.

These two places are obviously ‘constructs’ of the human imagination, by human standards and outlook, the ecstasies promised and the tortures threatened are not only of human concept but are also distinctly period defined (are there personal computers in either place?). There cannot be two more dissimilar destinations in the after-life, heaven is a joyous place of endless pleasures and creature comforts, while hell is all agony, suffering and torture.

### Need to safeguard people’s mandate on AKD and NPP

While the domestically disgruntled political elements are looking for opportunities to make life difficult for President AKD and his NPP Government those very elements could become tools at the hands of foreign elements with their own strategic agenda

On 21 August 2024 ‘Colombo Telegraph’ published an article titled, “Will the old order accept AKD victory?” The reason for raising that question then was because, of all the 39 contestants in the race for Presidency, including the two front runners Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) and Sajith Premadasa (SP), only AKD stood for something radically different. While all the others had exhibited no understanding of the root cause of the poly-crises that plagued the nation and promising blindly to tackle them rather spasmodically with the help of foreign agencies and advisors, only AKD was advocating something entirely different.

Is it fair to conduct media raids using the Prevention of Terrorism Act? During the election, the current Government received a significant support from the social media sector. Yet now, they are using the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which they promised to remove, to hunt down social media activists. We propose that if they mean what they say, they should stop this repression
