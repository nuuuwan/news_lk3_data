    "Sri Lanka has the potential to become for India what Macau is to China, according to Lawrence Ho, chairman of Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd., as the Hong Kong-listed gaming resorts operator opened its first South Asian property in Colombo on August 2.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka can be to India what Macau is to China,\u201d Ho said at the launch of the $1.2 billion City of Dreams Sri Lanka project, developed with the country\u2019s John Keells Holdings.",
    "\u201cMacau is by far the biggest gaming market in the world. Colombo is the closest destination to India, and an integrated resort like this gives the city a lot of potential,\u201d he added.",
    "The plush property \u2013 more than a decade in the making \u2013 includes two hotels, apartments, adult gaming facilities, restaurants, a shopping mall and event spaces.",
    "A star-studded launch event is scheduled for tonight, with Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan performing at what is expected to be a glittering affair.",
    "The top executive added that the sea-facing resort is designed to draw affluent tourists from India, the Middle East, Russia and China, positioning Colombo as a gateway destination.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is perfectly positioned as a gateway to key feeder markets,\u201d said Balendra.",
    "\u201cIndia in particular is showing tremendous growth in its affluent middle and upper classes. By leveraging our global network of properties and expertise, we aim to attract high-end international travelers who are seeking world-class experiences in an authentic and unique destination like Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "At the same conference, Krishna Balendra, Chairperson of the John Keels Group, pointed out that the scale of the development sends a strong signal to global investors that Sri Lanka is open, stable and investable after years of political turmoil and an economic crisis.",
    "\u201cThis project with an investment of $1.2 billion is expected to generate a significant multiplier effect for the Sri Lankan economy. 1000s of jobs in construction, retail, technology, hospitality, FDI,\u201d said Balendra. He added that it\u2019s their most ambitious project, but is confident that it will boost the country\u2019s GDP.",
    "\u201cToday is not just a launch of a milestone project, it\u2019s a defining moment for Sri Lanka. This is our country\u2019s largest private sector investment and it\u2019s our declaration of belief in Sri Lanka\u2019s future ... Through every challenge from economic headwinds to the global pandemic, we have chosen to invest not retreat.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis project is about more than creating a luxury resort,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping to elevate Sri Lanka\u2019s global profile and contributing to its tourism economy. A development of this scale has a cascading effect \u2014 it drives demand for local products, services and supply.\u201d",
    "Ho said he first visited Colombo in 2013 and was shown renderings of the building.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve built some pretty amazing properties around the world, but this one seemed impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd today, we are standing in this iconic building.\u201d",
    "He described the project as a collaboration aimed at helping to \u201craise Colombo\u2019s profile on the map of global cities\u201d by leveraging Melco\u2019s experience in luxury hospitality and entertainment.",
    "Balendra said the resort was conceived in 2010 as Sri Lanka emerged from a 25-year civil war.",
    "\u201cWe stayed the course despite the Easter bombings, the pandemic and the economic crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe the stability we are seeing now creates an opportunity to position Colombo as a regional and global hub.\u201d",
    "A formal legal framework for gaming, introduced in 2023, enabled Melco to enter the market. The company has a 20-year license to operate adult gaming facilities within the resort.",
    "Balendra said winter bookings at the group\u2019s hotels, including the new resort, are ahead of last year.",
    "Melco Resorts operates integrated resorts in Macau, Manila and Cyprus, with City of Dreams Sri Lanka marking its first move into South Asia."
