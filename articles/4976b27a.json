    "At least one person was killed and seven wounded when a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside a hotel belonging to US President-elect Donald Trump in Las Vegas, police said Wednesday.",
    "The electric vehicle pulled up to the Trump International Hotel\u2019s glass entrance before a \u201clarge explosion,\u201d Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters.",
    "Video footage shows the stainless steel truck parked at the hotel entrance before bursting into flames, followed by smaller explosions that appeared similar to fireworks.",
    "McMahill said there was \u201cone deceased individual inside the Cybertruck\u201d while seven people received \u201cminor\u201d injuries. He said the hotel had been evacuated.",
    "US President Joe Biden said authorities were investigating any possible link between the blast and an attack earlier Wednesday in New Orleans, in which a truck rammed a crowd, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens.",
    "\u201cThus far, there\u2019s nothing to report on that score,\u201d Biden said.",
    "FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz described the Las Vegas blast as \u201can isolated incident,\u201d adding: \u201cWe do not believe that there\u2019s a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\u201d",
    "Tesla chief Elon Musk said that the explosion was \u201ccaused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck,\u201d adding in a post on X that it was \u201cunrelated to the vehicle itself.\u201d",
    "Earlier, he said the \u201cwhole Tesla senior team\u201d was investigating the blast, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d",
    "Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the explosion. US media including NBC and CBS reported that authorities were investigating it as a potential terror attack, citing unnamed sources.",
    "There had been indications that the suspect in the New Orleans attack had been inspired by the Islamic State group, Biden said.",
    "McMahill said that so far they had \u201cno indication\u201d that the blast in Las Vegas had any similar links to the Islamic State group.",
    "However, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a Tesla truck, and we know Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it\u2019s the Trump tower. So there\u2019s obviously things to be concerned about there and that\u2019s something we continue to look at.\u201d",
    "Musk, who backed Trump in the November election and was named by the Republican to head up a commission to trim government spending, said he would post more information \u201cas soon as we learn anything.\u201d"
