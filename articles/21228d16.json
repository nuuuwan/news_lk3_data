  "original_body_lines": [
    "Leader of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance and Gampaha District parliamentary candidate, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera urged the public to vote for \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 to establish a strong opposition capable of challenging and changing the existing system.",
    "He made this statement at a public meeting held in Raddolugama, as part of a series of gatherings leading up to the upcoming general election.",
    "During the event, Jayaweera remarked, \u201cMinister Vijitha Herath said that money wasn\u2019t printed. If it had been, it would have had Anura Kumara\u2019s signature on it. I was surprised; he\u2019s been a parliament member for about 25 years and studied at Kelaniya University around the same time as I did. Currency printing isn\u2019t just about printing paper rupees; it means increasing the country\u2019s money supply. I honestly believe he may not understand this basic economic concept,\u201d he added.",
    "Explaining further, Jayaweera said, \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s currency has increased liquidity, which means soon you\u2019ll need more money to purchase goods. This will drive inflation.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve launched this political campaign for you. Your vote won\u2019t be in vain. For the first time, we are building a courageous opposition that exists to defend your interests,\u201d he said."
