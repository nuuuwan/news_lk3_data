    "This shipment marks the second in a series of deliveries as the terminal gears up for Phase 1 operations in February of 2025.",
    "This follows the earlier delivery of 5 CRMGs on 3 September. In total, CWIT will have 9 cranes operational before the terminal officially begins handling cargo next year. These state-of-the-art automated cranes are designed to improve efficiency and enhance safety by reducing human intervention and increasing operational precision.",
    "CWIT\u2019s phased development plan will see the terminal equipped with 30 fully automated CRMGs and 14 semi-automated RMQCs by its final completion, making it a cornerstone in the expansion of Sri Lanka\u2019s port sector. The terminal\u2019s advanced infrastructure and technology will significantly increase container handling capacity at POC, enabling it to keep pace with growing global trade demands.",
    "The substantial investment and capacity enhancement of CWIT will elevate Port of Colombo\u2019s position in terms of throughput and connectivity. Once fully operational, CWIT will play a pivotal role in fuelling economic growth, providing much-needed capacity to accommodate mega-vessels and increasing regional trade. Its future-proof design ensures scalability and efficiency, supporting POC\u2019s ambition to solidify its position as a key gateway hub in the Indian Ocean.",
    "CWIT said it is poised to become one of the most advanced and strategically significant container terminals in the Indian Ocean region. As a key player in the global maritime industry, CWIT is committed to leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance container handling efficiency. The terminal represents a critical milestone in Colombo\u2019s journey to solidify its position as a premier maritime hub, driving economic growth and facilitating international trade across Asia and beyond. CWIT said its vision is resonated in their tagline; Connect. Collaborate. Contribute."
