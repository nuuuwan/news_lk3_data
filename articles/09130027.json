    "Colombo, May 7 (Daily Mirror) - The Road Development Authority (RDA) has assigned two special teams to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the collapse of a concrete beam in the first section of the Central Expressway project, the RDA Director General said.",
    "He said that through these inspections, these officials will quickly check the current condition of all the concrete beams constructed along the Central Expressway Project Part I and apply the necessary remedies.",
    "\"This will ensure that the expressway is built to the required standards and conditions and that full supervision and follow-up are carried out on a regular basis to maintain it safely. Since this section of the highway is currently under construction, the road construction contractor has to bear the financial loss incurred for this purpose,\" the Director General said.",
    "The Kadawata-Mirigama section of the Central Expressway Project is 18+100 kms long, and the concrete beam that collapsed on May 4 in the section is 30 metres long and weighs more than 80 tons.",
    "In November 2021, this concrete beam was placed on the concrete piers at this site. Two and a half years have passed, but the remaining work at this site could not be completed.",
    "\"When placing concrete beams on concrete pillars, rubber bearing pads are placed on the concrete beams to protect them. It is observed that the beam has fallen off the rubber bearing pad and collapsed. Apart from this, two other beams have also been damaged due to this,\" he said."
