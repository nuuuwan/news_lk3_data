Yes, it’s scrub time, this week, too, as lots of readers did indicate to me that they would like to see a few more body scrub beauty tips. Okay, here we go then…

You will need 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup extra virgin or regular olive oil.

In an air tight storage container, pour in the olive oil and scoop in the brown sugar and mix well, with a fork or metal spoon. Make sure to smash out the clumps. The mixture is now ready when it looks like wet sand.

This scrub can be used anywhere that you are having dry skin issues or want to just do a great exfoliation on. Apply a small amount of the sugar scrub to the area and begin lightly massaging it in circles. You don’t need to press down hard or apply much pressure to this scrub as the granules from the sugar will work to get the dead skin off. By simply massaging it into the area for a few seconds and rinsing it under warm water in the shower, your skin will feel silky and soft.
