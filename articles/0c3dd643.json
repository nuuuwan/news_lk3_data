  "original_body_lines": [
    "Despite their crucial role, the contributions of plantation workers often go unnoticed",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe made a groundbreaking announcement during the May Day rally of the Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress in Kotagala, revealing a substantial seventy percent hike in the daily wage for plantation workers. This remarkable increase, raising the wage to 1,700 comes as a recognition of the significant hardships faced by these workers and underscores their invaluable contribution to the economy, particularly in the realm of tea harvesting.",
    "The announcement, which was reflected in a gazette issued on April 25, 2024, also encompasses additional allowances and extends to workers within both the tea and rubber industries.",
    "It\u2019s disheartening to witness certain NGO-backed election monitors raising objections to the recently announced wage increase for Indian-origin indentured labourers, who were brought to Sri Lanka in the 19th century. They accuse the government of violating election laws. They say it\u2019s an immoral act though not a violation of election laws. The Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon, representing Regional Plantation Companies, has also \u2018put a spoke in the wheel\u2019 by voicing its intention to contest the proposed Rs.1,700 daily wage increase for plantation workers.",
    "While clarifying that a final decision has not yet been reached, the Association confirmed that its members will be filing objections. It expressed concerns about the announcement, remarks made by government officials, and the tone of media coverage, suggesting that these factors could raise expectations among workers, potentially leading to disappointment and unrest. Additionally, neither the effective date nor the specific amount of the proposed minimum payment has been determined yet, according to the PA.",
    "In 2022, as the rupee experienced a significant devaluation compared to the dollar, the plantation companies profited greatly from their exports. However, instead of sharing these gains with the impoverished plantation workers, the companies retained the entirety of the benefits for themselves. This exploitation of currency fluctuations served to further widen the economic disparity between the plantation companies and the workers, exacerbating the already dire financial conditions faced by the laborers.",
    "This wage increase holds particular significance as we commemorate 200 years since the British brought them to Sri Lanka, highlighting their enduring economic, social, and political marginalization within the country. The early history of labour migration to Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, saw the arrival of the first group of \u201ccoolies\u201d around 1817.",
    "Initially employed to build the road from Colombo to Kandy, these labourers played a vital role in the region\u2019s infrastructure development. Subsequent waves were brought in to work on coffee plantations between 1830 and 1880, significantly boosting the island\u2019s agricultural economy. The journey of these coolies was arduous and dangerous. Starting from the northern parts of Ceylon, they trekked through jungles, enduring hunger and lack of proper clothing. Some went without water and were exposed to wildlife hazards. Survival depended on speed, and those unable to keep up were left behind to face the perils of the wilderness alone.",
    "However, it\u2019s crucial to understand this migration within the broader geopolitical context of British rule in India, where labour export agreements were decided solely by British officials, leaving the local populace with little say in their migration to Ceylon.",
    "Workers who migrated to Ceylon during the colonial era endured severe hardships in India, including famine, caste-based discrimination, and poverty. Many saw working on plantations in Ceylon as a chance for survival or better conditions. However, life on the plantations fell short of expectations. Families lived in cramped quarters, lacking basic amenities like sanitation and clean water. The work itself was grueling, with demanding quotas and harsh oversight.",
    "Despite their crucial role, the contributions of plantation workers often go unnoticed. Without their tireless labour, the Sri Lankan tea industry would falter. The legacy of Ceylon tea, celebrated worldwide, embodies the remarkable contributions of plantation workers who endured harsh conditions. Yet, beneath this success lies a darker tale of Indian slavery and exploitation, deeply affecting Indian Tamil workers and their descendants. For over two centuries, their labour has been the cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry. However, their struggles, from harsh labour conditions to denial of basic rights, have often been overlooked, perpetuating their marginalization.",
    "Housing was cramped, with families squeezed into small rooms, lacking basic amenities like sanitation and medical care. Work was grueling, with strict quotas and harsh oversight adding to the burden. Despite their vital role, these workers often go unnoticed in the history of the tea industry. Without their tireless labour, the machinery of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry would grind to a halt. Despite comprising 4.2% of the population, they\u2019ve faced disregarding and neglect. The Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948, influenced by Sinhala nationalism, imposed strict identity requirements, rendering many stateless despite generations on the island. This lack of recognition deprived them of basic rights and perpetuated their relegation.",
    "Additionally, under this system, individual houses lack assigned addresses, falling under estate management\u2019s control. This absence leads to administrative complications, law enforcement challenges, and voting difficulties. Important correspondence often fails to reach recipients as all mail must go through the estate\u2019s head office, distributed at management\u2019s convenience. Consequently, workers miss time-sensitive EPF notices, and students completing their AL education may not receive university acceptance letters promptly. These housing and ownership issues compound challenges in estate workers\u2019 daily lives. The journey from their line houses to work areas, sometimes on different hills, is already arduous, further exacerbated by poorly maintained roads. The return trip after a long day\u2019s toil only worsens the hardship.",
    "Despite their crucial role, the contributions of plantation workers\u00a0 often go unnoticed. Without their tireless labor, the Sri Lankan tea\u00a0 industry would falter. The legacy of Ceylon tea, celebrated worldwide,\u00a0 embodies the remarkable contributions of plantation workers who endured\u00a0 harsh conditions",
    "Furthermore, unions, ideally tasked with advocating for workers\u2019 demands and rights, often fail due to political interference. This leads to plantation workers remaining unaware of their entitled benefits as employees and their rights as citizens of Sri Lanka, exacerbating their exploitation and perpetuating their marginalization within the plantation system. The unions\u2019 failure to fulfill their role allows systemic injustices to persist unchecked. Political interference hampers their ability to effectively advocate for fair wages, improved working conditions, and other essential rights. Consequently, plantation workers labour under exploitative conditions, trapped in a cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement.",
    "The plight of plantation workers highlights the historical legacy of exploitation and marginalization that has persisted for generations. These workers, often overlooked and undervalued, have been integral to the success of the tea industry in Sri Lanka. Yet, their contributions have been overshadowed by systemic injustices perpetuated by colonial rulers and plantation companies.",
    "The misdirected resentment towards fellow labourers underscores the insidious tactics employed by colonial powers to maintain control and maximize profit. By pitting marginalized communities against each other, colonial authorities diverted attention from their own exploitation and negligence, effectively scapegoating plantation workers for the injustices inflicted upon them.",
    "It is crucial to amplify the voices of plantation workers and ensure that their rights are respected and upheld. The proposed wage increase signifies a modest yet pivotal advancement in rectifying the longstanding injustices endured by these workers. Instead of obstructing progress, Self-appointed election monitors, backed by NGOs and the Planters\u2019 Association should lend their support to initiatives aimed at uplifting and empowering plantation workers. By championing measures that guarantee fair compensation and acknowledgment for their labour, we can strive towards a more equitable and just society for all."
