    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe launched his ambitious International Climate Change University at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) with an aim to promote climate related research and technologies.",
    "The International Climate Change University was one of the proposals Wickremesinghe made in the last Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt in 2022 and his government has already allocated 600 acres of land in the central Nuwara Eliya district.",
    "The move was welcomed by many international partners in the COP28 held in Dubai.",
    "After the launch at the global conference, Ruwan Wijewardena, the senior advisor to president Wickremesinghe on Climate change said Bangladesh, India, Seychelles, Moldova, and Burkina Faso have pledged support to the new university.",
    "\u201cBasically, they are giving Sri Lanka thumbs up to go ahead in helping the international university. There has been a lot of interest on how they can come in,\u201d Wijewardena told Economy Next after the launch.",
    "\u201cNow Korea Exim Bank has come into giving us funds,\u201d he said without elaborating on the project cost as it is yet to be determined.",
    "\u201cNot only these countries, but how other institutions and other universities all can come in. We have been talking to universities. Universities from Yele to George Town, Chinese Research Universities, University of Geneva from Italy, and University from Gujarat, have been quite keen on coming in and establishing.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka plans to raise funds and expertise globally to establish the university and the move is expected to promote climate-change related research and technologies before the graduates start to contribute for lower emission and global warming.",
    "\u201cWe are still working on the whole project and the estimation of the cost. I think with the launching of this in the COP, now we can sit down and take a call,\u201d Wijewardena said.",
    "\u201cThe overall objective is to look at research and the climate specially on the Tropical Belt, which are most vulnerable.\u201d",
    "Along with the University, Wickremesinghe also launched Tropical Belt Initiative (TBI) and Climate Justice Forum (CJF) in a move to gather all the countries vulnerable for climate change under a common theme to bargain strongly with advanced countries to invest in their nations on green initiatives including wind and solar power projects.",
    "\u201cTropical Belt is the modulator of the climate of the world. So, we feel there must be more research on how we can prepare the rainforest, the seas on this Tropical Belt,\u201d Wijewardena said.",
    "\u201cThat is why the University is there to do research on climate technology and how we can preserve our environment in future.\u201d (Dubai/Dec 3/2023)"
