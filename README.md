### Is Sri Lanka ready to face a possible dementia epidemic?

Social aspects of dementia are becoming increasingly important as part of a wider shift in emphasis from cure to care

Dementia indeed is a very sad disease where the personality, habits and the routine of a loved one could drastically change, and family members would find it extremely stressful to recognise and deal with this “new person” who has evolved from the one they once knew.

In increasingly changing extended family life situations where home care for dementia patients has, and is becoming a major challenge, anecdotal evidence relating to how even dementia afflicted parents have been driven away from their homes or kept locked in rooms, are abound

### Untold lessons: Economic insights from history for Sri Lanka’s crisis

To achieve lasting growth and better manage its debt, the country must implement critical structural reforms

With a new Government in power, Sri Lanka finds itself grappling with immense economic challenges. The burden of enormous debts continues to weigh heavily on a fragile economy, necessitating robust growth to overcome these hardships. However, achieving such growth is complicated by a governmental predisposition toward centralised economic control, rooted in socialist-communal ideologies.

These challenges are not unique to Sri Lanka; they echo the historical pitfalls of centralised economic systems. This essay explores three illustrative examples from history: The failed socialism of the Plymouth Colony, the rapid recovery during the Forgotten Depression of 1920-1921, and the transformative innovation of the Gilded Age.

Sri Lanka will soon formulate a national policy on allowing visits by foreign research vessels, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said here on Friday, amidst frequent docking requests from Chinese surveillance ships which raised concerns in India.

Herath’s comments came days after Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s visit to India.

In January, Sri Lanka enforced a year-long moratorium on foreign marine scientific research survey vessels operating in its waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone after strong security concerns were raised by India and the US following frequent docking requests from hi-tech Chinese surveillance vessels.

Sri Lanka’s moratorium on allowing research vessels is still in force which would be reviewed appropriately, Herath said.

Upon his return to Colombo from India, Dissanayake held a meeting with a top Chinese government official who expressed China’s wish to see Chinese research ships resuming their visits to Colombo.
