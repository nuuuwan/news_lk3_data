  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Court of Appeal (CoA) has permitted mediation in the case filed by 14 travel agents challenging the allocation of Hajj pilgrimage quotas by Sri Lanka\u2019s Hajj Committee.",
    "The case was taken up before CoA Judges Sobitha Rajakaruna and Mohan Goppalawa, where legal counsel for both parties agreed to mediate the matter further. Consequently, the contempt charges filed by the petitioners against the defendants for allegedly violating Supreme Court guidelines on pilgrim selection were withdrawn.",
    "During the proceedings, the defendants agreed to adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s guidelines for selecting travel agents, which had been central to the dispute. The Hajj Committee was granted discretion to allocate the quota of pilgrims to travel operators in accordance with these guidelines.",
    "The petitioners, however, argued in their writ petition that the allocation process was arbitrary and did not follow the guidelines established by the Supreme Court. They alleged that more than 14 travel agents were denied any quota allocation, claiming this led to victimisation and unfair treatment.",
    "The petitioners further highlighted concerns over large sums of money involved in the process, alleging it was vulnerable to corrupt practices. They asserted that the improper selection of travel agents had caused significant financial and reputational damage to their operations."
