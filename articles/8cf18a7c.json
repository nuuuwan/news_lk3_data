    "Dr. Gunawardana, who has championed the concept of citizen science for decades, called the garden \u201ca training ground for future scientists.\u201d With minimal land and maximum creativity, the site showcases how even small plots can play a vital role in national biodiversity conservation. \u201cA few host plants in your backyard can support entire butterfly lifecycles,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis place is proof of what we can do, even in tight urban corners.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s first urban butterfly garden, nestled in the heart of a dense cityscape, in Moratuwa officially reopened on Saturday \u2014not just as a refuge for fluttering wings, but as a vibrant educational and ecological landmark. The garden\u2019s evolution over more than a decade has transformed it into a living laboratory, a pollinator haven, and a symbol of sustainable urban co-existence.",
    "At the heart of this transformation is Dr. Jagath Gunawardana, senior environmental lawyer and one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most respected conservationists. Speaking at the event, Dr. Gunawardana offered a powerful reframe: \u201cIt is more than a butterfly garden. It\u2019s a pollinator refuge\u2014a space that supports a broad spectrum of pollinators essential for our survival.\u201d",
    "Referencing the Butterfly and Pollinator Conservation Action Plans introduced by the Ministry of Environment in 2014, he highlighted the urgent need for such spaces, especially in urban areas where habitat fragmentation is accelerating. \u201cWe need to think beyond aesthetics,\u201d he said. \u201cThese gardens are lifelines. They support butterflies, native bees, and even serve as micro-labs for research and education.\u201d",

    "The garden, first proposed by naturalist Rajika Gamage in 2011, now boasts over 62 species of butterflies, up from just four when it first opened. Through the careful planting of native host and nectar plants, the team\u2014led by Dilmah Conservation\u2014has crafted a thriving ecosystem.",
    "Gamage, who has spent years studying Sri Lanka\u2019s butterfly populations, said, \u201cButterflies are not just beautiful; they are bioindicators. Their decline reflects deeper ecological imbalances.\u201d He urged citizens to cultivate host plants like curry leaf, guava, cinnamon, and anona, adding, \u201cIf every home became a micro-habitat, we could reverse these declines.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is globally recognised as a biodiversity hotspot, yet many of its pollinators face existential threats. Rapid urbanisation, pesticide use, climate change, and habitat loss are all driving factors in the decline of butterfly populations. The urban butterfly garden offers an alternative vision\u2014one in which built environments can also serve as sanctuaries for wildlife.",
    "Dr. Himesh Jayasinghe, a respected biologist and university lecturer, highlighted the educational value of the garden. \u201cThis space isn\u2019t just about photography,\u201d he said. \u201cSome students captured rare behavioural moments\u2014a butterfly escaping an ant attack, or unique mating displays. Observing these behaviours helps us understand their ecology, which is vital for targeted conservation.\u201d",
    "He also noted lesser-known facts, such as how some butterflies undergo pupal hibernation to survive dry seasons. \u201cTake the spot swordtail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears in the hottest, driest months after spending weeks in a dormant pupal state. You wouldn\u2019t learn that from books alone. You need a space like this.\u201d",
    "At the reopening ceremony, Rishan Sampath, Manager of Dilmah Conservation and Sustainability, reflected on the journey. \u201cToday, we not only reopened Sri Lanka\u2019s first corporate-funded open-air butterfly garden, but we celebrated the photographers, scientists, and students who keep this place alive. Their work reminds us why pollinators matter.\u201d",
    "He stressed that such gardens are more than decorative: \u201cPollinators are essential to food security. If we lose them, we lose the crops they fertilise. This garden is a reminder of that link.\u201d",
    "The butterfly garden\u2019s rebirth also brought with its innovative ecological solutions. One key example was its mosquito control strategy. Originally plagued by mosquito populations, the garden now features a small pond filled with surface-feeding fish and dragonflies.",
    "Dilhan C. Fernando, Chairman of Dilmah Tea, recalled the moment he raised concerns about mosquitoes to Rajika Gamage. \u201cHe told me he could fix it\u2014not with chemicals, but with nature. And he did. A simple pond with the right fish and insects did the trick. It was ancient wisdom meeting modern need.\u201d",
    "Fernando spoke movingly about his father\u2019s vision for Sri Lanka: \u201cHe started Dilmah not to make money, but to benefit people and the environment. This garden is a continuation of that legacy.",
