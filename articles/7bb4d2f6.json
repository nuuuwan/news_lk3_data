    "At the grand finale of the DEI Champion Awards 2025, held last week at the City of Dreams in Colombo, the private sector was called upon to play a transformative role in shaping an inclusive, equitable and peaceful Sri Lanka. Organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in partnership with the SCOPE Programme \u2014 co-financed by the European Union and the German Federal Foreign Office \u2014 the awards recognised pioneering organisations championing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across Sri Lanka\u2019s business landscape.",
    "Chairperson of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Krishan Balendra, delivering the keynote address, emphasised the broader significance of the evening.",
    "Balendra said: \u201cIt is my great honour and pleasure to welcome you all to the grand finale of the DEI Awards 2025 \u2014 an evening where we shine a spotlight on those organisations leading the way in diversity, equity and inclusion. This inspiring event will honour the achievements of these pioneering organisations and highlight their contributions to the sustainable development of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy on the global stage.\u201d",
    "The event marked the culmination of a comprehensive countrywide effort under the project \u2018Advancing DEI in Small and Medium Enterprises\u2019, led by the Chamber and supported by GIZ Sri Lanka. Over the past year, the project hosted policy discussions and capacity-building workshops across all nine provinces, engaging stakeholders from government, private enterprise, civil society and local development agencies.",
    "\u201cThese workshops aimed to explore current DEI practises, identify implementation challenges and assess the key steps needed for future progress, Balendra noted. \u201cDEI is not just a buzzword. It is the backbone of strong, adaptive organisations. Businesses that invest in inclusion are stronger, more resilient and better positioned to compete globally.\u201d",
    "He reaffirmed the Chamber\u2019s commitment to continuing engagement, advocacy and training to embed DEI practices deeply across Sri Lankan enterprises, large and small.",
    "The event also featured a powerful address by Aaranya Rajasingam, Programme Component Manager for Economic Inclusion, SCOPE Programme, GIZ Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cTonight is a celebration of businesses who are not only transforming the way they work, but the communities they serve, she said. \u201cAt SCOPE, we try to take a holistic approach to promoting business impacts for social cohesion and peace.\u201d",
    "She noted that the DEI initiative was anchored in serious ground-level engagement. Through mapping and research efforts led by advisors like William Baxter and supported by local leaders such as Hasaki Diasing and Solomon Fernando, the programme created spaces for honest, reflective discussions on how DEI is understood \u2014 and misunderstood \u2014 in diverse regional business contexts.",
    "\u201cDo people in the regional sectors understand what DEI is, the same way the national businesses understand it? What is the difference, and what is our difference? she asked. \u201cThis is really important in understanding how national level policies must connect with local communities.\u201d",
    "Rajasingam also praised the efforts of frontline public institutions \u2014 including the National Enterprise Development Authority, Small Enterprise Development Division, Divisional Secretariats and local chambers \u2014 for laying the groundwork for DEI integration at grassroots levels.",
    "\u201cBut inclusive growth cannot be the burden of public institutions alone, she asserted. \u201cThe private sector must now help us go beyond using DEI as a compliance requirement or a CSR activity. It must become a way of shaping identities, building trust and anchoring stability in a country still healing from divisions.\u201d",
    "In a clear call to action, she stressed that \u201cthe most resilient businesses are those embedded in resilient communities.\u201d",
    "The evening also saw a strong endorsement from the government side, with Deputy Minister of National Integration Muneer Mulaffer delivering a brief but powerful message on the state\u2019s role in promoting cohesion.",
    "\u201cInjustices in society must be wiped out. Coexistence should be paramount for a progressive country. A responsible government must work towards fulfilling the aspirations of the people, he said.",
