    "FINAP Founder and CEO Dr. Kutila Pinto recently participated at the 40th ASOCIO Summit in Tokyo. At the summit, FINAP was awarded the prestigious \u2018Outstanding Tech Organisation\u2019 title\u2014a recognition that marks the company\u2019s transformation from a promising Sri Lankan start-up to a rising global leader in financial technology.",
    "In this interview Dr. Pinto shared insights about FINAP\u2019s remarkable journey, the values driving the organisation, and its vision for the future. Below is an in-depth discussion on how FINAP is redefining financial technology and empowering communities both locally and internationally.",
    "A: This recognition is a monumental milestone for FINAP. It reflects the hard work of our team, the relevance of our solutions, and our commitment to empowering communities through innovative financial technology. Being acknowledged on such a global platform reaffirms that our mission and values resonate beyond Sri Lanka and inspire us to push further boundaries.",
    "Q: Every company has its beginnings. What were the early days of FINAP like?",
    "A: FINAP\u2019s early days were challenging but deeply formative. In Sri Lanka, the lack of innovation capital and limited fluidity in capital markets made securing funding particularly difficult. Despite external capital availability, I chose to inject my own capital and bootstrap the company to ensure its early survival.",
    "These constraints pushed us to innovate and operate efficiently. By refining our ideas and focusing on solving practical financial challenges for underserved communities, we built a resilient and adaptable foundation. Those early lessons continue to guide FINAP\u2019s growth today.",
    "Q: FINAP was inspired by your extensive experience in banking and finance. Can you share more about your career journey and how it shaped your vision?",
    "A: My career in banking and finance spans over two decades. I started as a banking assistant at Seylan Bank. I have worked in many markets; Asia, Middle East, Australasia and the Pacific. Towards the end of my career at banking, I served as general manager for Westpac Bank in the Solomon Islands and later as Director of Retail for Westpac Pacific, overseeing operations across the region. These roles gave me hands-on experience in understanding how financial systems work in diverse and often underserved markets. They highlighted the importance of tailoring solutions to meet local needs, which became a guiding principle for FINAP.",
    "Q: Founding a commercial bank is an achievement many in the banking and finance industry would proudly celebrate. We understand that you accomplished this remarkable feat at a very young age in the Pacific\u2014can you tell us more about it?",
    "A: Indeed, I was 36 years old when I established a fully-fledged commercial bank in the Solomon Islands. It was one of the most fulfilling achievements of my career. It was a challenging endeavour, involving regulatory complexities and building trust within the community. The experience taught me the importance of balancing innovation with responsibility and the power of financial systems to uplift communities. The political and the regulatory leadership of the country were very appreciative of my achievement. I am proud of my achievements and to do so as a Sri Lankan. It\u2019s a mindset I carried forward into FINAP\u2019s mission.",
    "Q: How did FINAP navigate challenges to establish itself as a strong software business?",
    "A: Our journey involved constant adaptation and a relentless focus on innovation. One key breakthrough was the development of the Connected-Software-Solution-Application-Concept (CSSAC), a framework that underpins our flagship products like CIXOR, FirstMicro, ECORU, and MULA. By staying attuned to market feedback, we created solutions that are scalable and adaptable, meeting the needs of financial institutions and the communities they serve.",
    "Q: Can you explain what CSSAC is and how it ties into FINAP?",
    "A: CSSAC is a concept I developed during my DBA studies at UCAM, Spain. It stems from my thesis, \u201cA Study of Infusion of Technology to Microfinance Operators to Achieve Sustainability and Technology-driven Value Chain Architecture for Efficiency and Outreach: The Case of Sri Lanka. \u201cCSSAC provides a simplified yet powerful interface that connects borrowers and lenders, improving accessibility and efficiency. This framework forms the backbone of FINAP\u2019s platforms, ensuring they remain intuitive, scalable, and impactful.",
    "Q: Empowering grassroots communities in Sri Lanka is central to FINAP\u2019s mission. How do your solutions achieve this?",
    "A: Our platforms are designed to make financial services accessible to micro-entrepreneurs and small-scale producers, offering them tools to grow their businesses and improve their livelihoods. We work closely with microfinance institutions and nano-lenders to ensure they can provide credit and other financial services in a sustainable, user-friendly way. This approach empowers individuals while driving economic growth from the ground up.",
    "Q: How do your platforms create a positive impact on the microfinance ecosystem?",
    "A: Solutions like FirstMicro and CIXOR enhance the operational capabilities of microfinance providers by offering real-time data access, mobile-first transaction systems, and scalability. These tools allow institutions to serve more clients efficiently while improving the borrower experience.",
    "Using FINAP\u2019s solutions, micro and small borrowers gain access to lending opportunities that leverage their business cash flow as a foundation for creditworthiness. This empowers them to borrow with confidence and reinvest in their businesses, creating opportunities for growth and sustainability. Ultimately, our platforms help build a robust microfinance ecosystem models where small financial operators and borrowers can thrive, driving economic inclusion and community empowerment.",
    "A: The future of FINAP lies in deepening our dual focus on financial technology and software services, driving innovation and impact across both domains.",
    "On the financial technology front, we are laser-focused on scaling our flagship products, FirstMicro and CIXOR, to new markets. These platforms have already proven to be transformative in fostering financial inclusion and efficiency for microfinance institutions and nano-lenders. By expanding their reach, we aim to position FINAP as a global leader in fintech, empowering underserved communities worldwide. Importantly, we remain committed to championing the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty, by enabling grassroots entrepreneurs and micro-producers to access fair and sustainable financial solutions.",
    "At the same time, we\u2019re scaling up our software services operations. This channel enables FINAP to deliver custom software solutions across industries, enhancing efficiency and innovation for businesses globally. As part of our growth strategy, we\u2019re planning a targeted expansion into selected European markets, including the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. These countries represent dynamic opportunities for us to showcase Sri Lankan expertise on a global stage while delivering value to international clients.",
    "Through these two operational channels, we aim to continue excelling as a Sri Lankan success story, a company that not only uplifts local and regional communities but also contributes to the prosperity of neighbouring countries in South Asia and beyond. Our mission is to ensure that FINAP\u2019s technology solutions not only address immediate challenges but also lay the foundation for long-term economic empowerment and innovation.",
    "Looking ahead, we envision FINAP as a global brand synonymous with technology-driven empowerment and resilience, leading with purpose and delivering solutions that truly make a difference. This vision is rooted in our belief that technology can be a force for good, and with it, we can create a more inclusive and equitable future.",
    "Q: As FINAP\u2019s founder and CEO, what drives your vision for the company?",
    "A: I\u2019m driven by the belief that technology has the power to transform lives. Seeing how our solutions help individuals and businesses overcome financial barriers inspires me daily. At FINAP, our goal is to make financial systems work for everyone, especially those at the grassroots level. This mission fuels my passion and guides our journey forward.",
    "FINAP\u2019s story is one of resilience, innovation, and purpose. From its humble beginnings to earning global recognition, it stands as a testament to how technology and vision can create meaningful impact.",
    "Q: As someone who has successfully navigated the challenges of entrepreneurship, what advice would you give to new tech entrepreneurs and startups entering this complex and demanding world?",
    "A: Entrepreneurship is a journey that requires resilience, adaptability, and a strong sense of purpose. My first piece of advice is to focus on solving real-world problems. If your solution creates genuine value, it will naturally attract customers and support.",
    "Be prepared for challenges\u2014financial, operational, and even personal. Build a network of mentors and peers who can provide guidance and perspective. In the tech space, staying agile is crucial; listen to market feedback and be willing to pivot when necessary.",
    "I would also emphasise the importance of financial discipline. Many startups falter because they lack a clear understanding of how to manage resources effectively. Whether you\u2019re bootstrapping or raising external capital, every dollar should work towards achieving your vision.",
    "Finally, embrace the long-term mindset. Success in entrepreneurship rarely happens overnight. Stay committed to your goals, and remember that the lessons learned from failures are often the foundation of future success. As Richard Branson once said, \u201cBusiness opportunities are like buses; there\u2019s always another one coming.\u201d Keep moving forward, and don\u2019t let setbacks define your journey."
