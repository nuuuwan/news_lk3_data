    "Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - The way that the present chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) conducted the affairs of the public consultation regarding the electricity tariff revision was not appropriate and unacceptable at all, former PUCSL chairman Janaka Ratnayaka said.",
    "\"The manner in which the current chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) handled the public consultation on the revision of electricity tariffs was inappropriate and entirely unacceptable,\" he said.",
    "The public consultation regarding the electricity tariff revision was conducted on February 15 by the PUCSL at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conferance Hall (BMICH).",
    "Addressing the media, Ratnayake described that the PUCSL was set up to look into the welfare of the public, as its name implies.",
    "He claimed that the current chairman does not have any experience conducting this type of public matter, as he does not know the difference between public consultation and a public hearing. He also claimed that the current chairman used inappropriate language to control the people who made presentations at the consultation, which is also unacceptable.",
    "Therefore, he urged the political hierarchy and the Constitutional Council, which appoints members to this type of important, independent commission, to be mindful when selecting members in the future.",
    "The present composition of the PUCSL is not properly constituted, and there is no qualified businessman member who represents the business community on the board, said Ratnayake and therefore, he urged the political hierarchy and the people who recommend these positions to be mindful when selecting members to the commission in the future."
