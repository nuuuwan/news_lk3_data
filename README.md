We all prefer to better understand the world around us. In some cases, we need to explain what the amendments are really going to do in the Gaza, what is really going to be done to the government to do so,. Or you may want to know a simple point, such as the dating back on the day of the bus.

If the information is looking for or simple, we all have the right to obtain that information through reliable news.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) noted a marginal decline in monthly exports in August 2025, compared to the same period last year.

“In August 2025, total apparel exports stood at US$ 479.14 million, reflecting a 1.33% decrease compared to August 2024,” JAAF said in a statement.

“The month of August reflects the volatility in global markets, with pressure on exports to the EU and UK,” JAAF said.

Exports to the USA recorded a modest gain of 0.92 percent, while shipments to the EU and UK saw declines of 4.83 percent and 2.6 percent.

“Despite the August dip, the sector maintained positive momentum over the January–August 2025 period.”

Total exports grew by 7.48 percent to 3.39 billion dollars, JAAF said, compared with 3.16 billion dollars during the same period in 2024.

“This growth was underpinned by strong demand from the EU (up 14.66%), supported by gains in the USA (2.58%), the UK (4.54%), and other markets (9.45%).”
