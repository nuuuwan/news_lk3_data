  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced on Thursday to 27 years and three months in prison hours after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, dealing a powerful rebuke to one of the world\u2019s most prominent far-right populist leaders.",
    "The conviction ruling by a panel of five justices on Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court, who also agreed on the sentence, made the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in the country\u2019s history to be convicted for attacking democracy, and drew disapproval from the Trump administration.",
    "\u201cThis criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present and its future,\u201d Justice Carmen Lucia said before her vote to convict Bolsonaro, referring to a history checkered with military coups and attempts to overthrow democracy.",
    "There was ample evidence that Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, acted \u201cwith the purpose of eroding democracy and institutions,\u201d she added.",
    "Four of the five judges voted to convict the former president of five crimes: taking part in an armed criminal organization; attempting to violently abolish democracy; organizing a coup; and damaging government property and protected cultural assets.",
    "The conviction of Bolsonaro, a former army captain who never hid his admiration for the military dictatorship that killed hundreds of Brazilians between 1964 and 1985, follows legal condemnations for other far-right leaders this year, including France\u2019s Marine Le Pen and the Philippines\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte.",
    "It may further enrage Bolsonaro\u2019s close ally U.S. President Donald Trump, who had called the case a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and in retaliation hit Brazil with tariff hikes, sanctions against the presiding judge, and the revocation of visas for most of the high court justices.",
    "Asked about the conviction on Thursday, Trump again praised Bolsonaro, calling the verdict \u201ca terrible thing.\u201d",
    "As he watched his father\u2019s conviction from the U.S., Brazilian Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro told Reuters he expected Trump to consider imposing further sanctions on Brazil and its high court justices.",
    "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X the court had \u201cunjustly ruled,\u201d adding: \u201cThe United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt.\u201d",
    "The verdict was not unanimous, with Justice Luiz Fux on Wednesday breaking with his peers by acquitting the former president of all charges and questioning the court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
    "That single vote could open a path to challenges to the ruling, which could push the trial\u2019s conclusion closer to the October 2026 presidential election. Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he will be a candidate in that election despite being barred from running for office.",
    "The conviction of Bolsonaro marks the nadir in his trajectory from the back benches of Congress to his forging of a powerful conservative coalition that tested the limits of the country\u2019s young democratic institutions.",
    "His political journey began in the 1980s on the Rio de Janeiro city council after a brief career as an army paratrooper. He went on to serve nearly three decades as a congressman in Brasilia, where he quickly became known for his defense of authoritarian-era policies.",
    "In one interview, he argued that Brazil would only change \u201con the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn\u2019t do: killing 30,000.\u201d",
    "Long dismissed as a fringe player, he later refined his message to play up anti-corruption and pro-family values themes. He found fertile ground as mass protests erupted across Brazil in 2014 and 2015 amid the sprawling \u201cCar Wash\u201d graft scandal that implicated hundreds of politicians \u2013 including President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose own conviction was later annulled.",
    "Anti-establishment anger opened the path for his successful 2018 presidential run, with dozens of far-right and conservative lawmakers elected on his coattails. They have reshaped Congress into an enduring obstacle to Lula\u2019s progressive agenda.",
    "Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency was marked by intense skepticism of vaccines during the pandemic and an embrace of illegal mining and cattle ranching in the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation climbed.",
    "As he faced a tough reelection campaign against Lula in 2022 - which Lula went on to win - Bolsonaro\u2019s comments took on an increasingly messianic quality, raising concerns about his willingness to accept the results.",
    "\u201cI have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed, or victory,\u201d he said, in remarks to a meeting of evangelical leaders in 2021. \u201cNo man on Earth will threaten me.\u201d",
    "In 2023, Brazil\u2019s electoral court barred him from public office until 2030 for venting unfounded claims about Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system.",
    "Lula\u2019s Institutional Relations Minister, Gleisi Hoffmann, said that Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction \u201censures that no one dares again to attack the rule of law or the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box.\u201d",
    "Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction and its durability will be a powerful test for the strategy that Brazil\u2019s highest-ranking judges have adopted to protect the country\u2019s democracy against what they describe as dangerous attacks by the far-right.",
    "Their targets have included social media platforms they accused of spreading disinformation about the electoral system, as well as politicians and activists who have attacked the court. Sending the former president and his allies to jail for planning a coup reflects a culmination of that polarizing strategy.",
    "The cases have largely been led by the commanding figure of Justice Alexandre de Moraes, appointed to the court by a conservative president in 2017, whose hardball approach to Bolsonaro and his allies has been celebrated by the left and denounced by the right as political persecution.",
    "\u201cThey want to get me out of the political game next year,\u201d Bolsonaro told Reuters in a recent interview, referring to the 2026 election in which Lula is likely to seek a fourth term. \u201cWithout me in the race, Lula could beat anyone.\u201d",
    "The historic significance of the case goes beyond the former president and his movement, said Carlos Fico, a historian who studies Brazil\u2019s military at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
    "The Supreme Court also ruled to convict seven of Bolsonaro\u2019s allies, including five military officers.",
    "The verdict marks the first time since Brazil became a republic almost 140 years ago that military officials have been punished for attempting to overthrow democracy.",
    "\u201cThe trial is a wake-up call for the armed forces,\u201d Fico said. \u201cThey must be realizing that something has changed, given that there was never any punishment before, and now there is.\u201d"
