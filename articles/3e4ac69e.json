    "Sri Lanka aspires to boost ties with Vietnam, especially in areas of great potential, said Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya at a reception held on October 3 for Vietnamese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Trinh Thi Tam.",
    "At the meeting, the Vietnamese Ambassador said that both nations have enjoyed sound relations between their parties, states, and parliaments, setting out hope that the two sides will intensify mutual visits and contacts at a high level.",
    "This is along with accelerating the implementation of bilateral co-operation mechanisms and expanding collaboration across potential areas such as tourism, culture, education and agriculture\u00a0 to encourage people-to-people exchanges.",
    "Other efforts include continuing ties of traditional co-operation and support for each other at multilateral forums, including the UN, as they will celebrate the 55th anniversary of their diplomacy next year.",
    "She also said she wishes that the Sri Lankan Government will keep offering favourable conditions for the Vietnamese people living, working, and studying in the island nation.",
    "Ambassador Tam used the occasion to convey the congratulations from high-ranking Vietnamese leaders to Sri Lanka on its successful organization of the ninth presidential election on September 21, expressing her belief that under the leadership of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka will overcome difficulties and challenges soon. It aims to continue its stable development and become an attractive destination of tourism, trade, and foreign investment.",
    "PM Amarasuriya, for her part, said she admires Vietnam\u2019s achievements in a variety of fields, with Vietnam boasting a development model that Sri Lanka could learn from, given the two nations\u2019 similarities in geography, history, and culture.",
    "Sri Lanka always respects the sentiments that the Vietnamese side has given to it, she said, adding that as the new Government of Sri Lanka wishes to boost ties with Vietnam, she will direct competent ministries and sectors to intensify discussions with the latter about measures to boost collaboration in potential domains, including trade, investment, culture, education and Buddhism.",
    "She acknowledged Ambassador Tam\u2019s recommendations on facilitating the import of Vietnamese goods, encouraging Sri Lankan businesses to make investment in Vietnam, and working hand in hand to launch a broad array of cultural exchange activities to mark the 55th anniversary of diplomatic ties."
