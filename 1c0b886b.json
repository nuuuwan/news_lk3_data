    "There are groups including those from the opposition to grab power as the country had reached some stability, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.",
    "Speaking at the UNP Colombo Central Bala Manadala meeting, Mr Wijewardene said there are those who want to grab power. \u201cThe incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the presidency when the country was bankrupt. Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa offered the premiership to incumbent Leader of Opposing Sajith Premadasa, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and to the JVP leader to accept the premiership. However, they all refused. The UNP leader had to accept the premiership and he brought some kind of stability to the nation. However, there are some groups including the opposition who are trying to grab power through sabotage today,\u201d he said.",
    "UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said racists are trying to grab power when the country had reached stability. \u201cThey grabbed power in 2002 when the country was on the way to stability. They did the same in 2019 when the country was gaining stability once again. We see the same thing happening today. These groups should be got rid of,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
