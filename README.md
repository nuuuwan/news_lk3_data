COLOMBO (News 1st); Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul personally piloted a plane on Tuesday (30) to retrieve life-saving organs from a donor in Loei province, before returning to Parliament for a crucial government policy debate.

The mission was part of Anutin’s long-standing “Wings of the Heart” initiative, which facilitates rapid organ transport for critical transplants.

Responding to an urgent request, Anutin left Parliament and flew two surgeons from Chulalongkorn University to Loei.

The organs—a heart, liver, pancreas, two kidneys, and two eyes—were donated by the family of a 19-year-old man who died following a local brawl.

Anutin met the donor’s parents, calling their decision “a great act of merit-making.”

After the successful retrieval, Anutin immediately flew back to Bangkok.

Defending his brief absence from the debate, he said he had contributed to the morning session and monitored proceedings remotely.

It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material

The tragedy that occurred at internationally famed Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks on the spot and injuring six other Bikkus is another heartrending news that shocked the entire Sri Lanka within the last one month. From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.

Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.
