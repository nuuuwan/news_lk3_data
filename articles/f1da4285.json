    "Before I get to the main topic for my oration today, I would like to briefly touch upon an important topic, which is close to my heart: Empowering Women in Engineering-and-Technology, which I will refer to as, Women in Engineering for brevity from here.",
    "The 2018 Pulimood orator, Professor Mrs Rathnayake, dedicated her oration to this topic. I wish to convey a message, on a particular aspect of the same topic, which I believe is pertinent to this occasion and audience, which consists of many educators who can make an impact, similar to the impact Mrs Pulimood made almost 70 years ago. It is somewhat sad to say, that in this 21st century, engineering remains male-dominated. This is the case both in industry and academia. A significant female under-representation in engineering exists worldwide.",
    "I want to take a moment here to reflect on my journey through engineering. When I chose the physical sciences stream for A/Ls, I did not have any idea of engineering as a profession. I chose Physical Sciences merely for the love of mathematics. I did not want to give up mathematics. That year there was only one physical science class at Visakha, compared to 12 bioscience classes. That is less than 10% of the science cohort chose physical sciences. At that time, it did not occur to me, that I was just starting a lifelong journey in a minority club! It was during my A/L years, thanks to four great teachers, whom I would like to name here, Mrs. Chithra Malalasekera, Mrs Sitha Siriwardena, Mrs. Shyamalee Ariyarathne, Mrs Gunaseeli Wijerathne, that I started appreciating the use of science and mathematics, in real-world applications. This sparked my interest in engineering as a profession.",
    "Upon completing A/Ls, I joined the University of Moratuwa to study engineering. As one of only 23 female students in a cohort of around 230 students, again in the less than 10% minority, I started to wonder if I had made the right choice. Let me give you one simple example of stereotyping in engineering, from my first year at the University. It was often the case, that I ended up being the only female student in the group, when it came to group work, for obvious reasons. However, it was not a coincidence, that my male colleagues assigned me as the note-taker, in every instance, while the male students did the more interesting engineering tasks.",
    "I am not blaming any of my male colleagues here, because most probably they meant well, and thought that the engineering tasks were too hard for females, but this is a stereotype. The expectation of me being the default notetaker, changed in my latter years at the University, after I was able to prove that, I was as good as them in engineering tasks. However, my point here is, that females must always prove themselves in engineering, whereas it is taken for granted that males are good engineers. Now as a mentor to many female engineering students, I remind them that they must not be the default note-taker for their groups \u2013 a practice that continues to date in many places.",
    "Fortunately for me, several female role models in engineering inspired me to keep going. Of them, the major inspiration for me was, Professor Mrs Indra Dayawanse, who was the Head of the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, at the University of Moratuwa, during that time. She was an exceptional engineering educator, who demonstrated that females not only could succeed in engineering but could also lead and excel.",
    "In my 35-year engineering career, that has spanned four continents, Asia, Europe, North America and Australia, both in industry and academia, being in the under 10% minority by gender most of the time, I have had first-hand experience of the challenges women in engineering face. Despite these challenges, my experience is that, the impact you can make on society as an engineer, gives you great intrinsic rewards and satisfaction, that outweigh all the negatives.",
    "I hope you will not disagree with me if I say that engineers are largely responsible for the advancements that have enhanced our quality of life. The contributions of engineering are evident in all facets of life including communication, transport and healthcare. Engineering involves creativity and problem-solving. Engineers make a profound impact by changing lives and shaping the world. These are areas where females excel and exhibit profound passion. However, it\u2019s disheartening that we haven\u2019t achieved anywhere near parity in Women in Engineering. Consequently, society is deprived of the invaluable female perspective in this field.",
    "Throughout my career, I\u2019ve actively pursued opportunities to advocate for increased female participation in engineering. Introduce engineering as a viable, and appealing, career option for young girls, during their early school years and present girls with female role models in engineering from an early age, especially between the ages of 12 and 16, a critical period, when they contemplate their future subject choices and careers. By doing so, we can inspire the next generation of girls to take up engineering and pave the way, for a more inclusive and innovative future. I believe that the teachers can make a huge positive impact here.",
    "Trailblazers like Mrs Pulimood have done an outstanding job, promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) among girls, which has made a difference in the biological sciences. However, more work is still needed in the physical sciences. Let us lead like Mrs Pulimood, to promote engineering and technology to the next generation of girls, to make a real change. In my opinion, that is the best tribute we can pay to Mrs Pulimood.",
    "Let me now get to the main topic for today: Artificial Intelligence: The Dream, The Nightmare and The Reality. Artificial intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is receiving widespread attention, and generating a spectrum of emotions among individuals. While some embrace it with excitement, others approach it with suspicion or even concern. My aim today is to address the diverse range of sentiments, and misconceptions, surrounding AI, and shed light on this transformative technology, to give you a better understanding of its potential implications.",
    "Considering the mixed audience here today, I will keep my presentation mostly non-technical. I hope everyone will be able to follow it. During this talk, I will use the terms Artificial Intelligence and AI interchangeably.",
    "AI has become ubiquitous, seamlessly integrating into our daily lives, whether we are aware of it or not. I will introduce AI with simple examples, which I believe most of you in the audience can relate to. Many of you, I believe, would have gone to YouTube to watch videos. Some others, who are avid movie lovers, nowadays subscribe to services like NetFlix to watch movies. In both these cases, when you access the service using the web, you enter a page, called the Homepage. The Homepage shows videos that the system automatically recommends for you. Have you ever noticed that the videos that are recommended to you, are different to what others get recommended? This is AI helping them. The service has learnt their preferences. This is an example of machine learning the foundation of AI.",
    "Another simple example is AI-based navigation applications, such as Google Navigation application, which many of you may already be using. It can give you directions, to a desired destination from a starting location and also the travel times. These travel times normally are quite accurate. In fact, more accurate than what you could estimate yourself. While these estimates account for typical uncertainties in traffic, Google is also able to update the estimates dynamically, if something major unexpected happens on the road. In this case, not only does Google do this task more accurately than you could do, but it does it way more efficiently. That is another example of AI.",
    "Let me now take you through the journey of AI, starting from the very beginning. At the time, Artificial Intelligence was just a dream! Although the concept of mimicing, or exceeding human intelligence, seems to have fascinated humans for centuries, machine intelligence, which is the basis of current AI, was only envisioned in the 1950s. Here is how it all started. Alan Turing is a British Computer Scientist, who is considered the father of Computer Science. In 1950, he envisioned the possibility of:",
    "\u201cA human, interacting with another human, and a computer, without knowing which one is which, and being unable to differentiate them from their responses\u201d.",
    "This test, then referred to as the Imitation Game, is now called the Turing Test, named after Alan Turing. This is the earliest known definition of machine intelligence, which came about around the same time computers were invented. The Turing Award considered the Nobel Prize in Computer Science, is named after this great scientist.",
    "Another key milestone in this journey of AI, was the American Computer Scientist, John McCathy, coining the term Artificial Intelligence in 1956; John McCarthy is recognized as the father of Artificial Intelligence. He defined AI as: \u201cThe science and engineering of making intelligent machines\u201d.",
    "This seminal definition encapsulates the essence of AI, marking the beginning of the journey of AI. John McCarthy was awarded the Turing Award in 1971 for his work on AI. Since its introduction, the journey of AI has been characterized by, cycles of rapid advancement, referred to as \u201cBooms\u201d, followed by periods of stagnation, often referred to as \u201cAI winters\u201d. AI is currently in its third boom, marked by unprecedented progress, and widespread adoption of AI technologies.",
    "Boom 1, in the very early days of computing, was about the programming and processing power of computers, being able to deliver intelligence. This approach is now referred to as \u201cGood Old Fashioned AI\u201d. Despite this being the early days, during this period there were a few bold predictions such as:",
    "Similar to today there was significant concern about AI and automation being a major risk to the American economy and society; people feared job losses. However, these bold predictions were not delivered during Boom 1, resulting in the first AI Winter! The second boom started in the 1980s. There was a shift in approach to achieving AI.",
    "Scientists began exploring the idea of, encoding all human knowledge into programmable rules in a computer. This approach, known as Expert Systems, may be a term some of you in this audience have encountered. A notable achievement in Boom 2 was, IBM\u2019s Chess Playing Computer, known as Deep Blue, defeating the reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, in a highly publicized competition in 1997. I doubt this is a milestone Kasporov celebrates in his chess career, but this is a significant milestone in AI and machine learning. However, it happened almost 40 years after the initial prediction!",
    "Despite this success, this approach to AI ultimately proved limited in its capabilities and failed to deliver sustained progress. As you can imagine, feeding the universal human knowledge, as rules to a computer proved impractical, leading to a second AI winter.",
    "Let us now transport ourselves to 2016, during the era known as Boom 3. In a monumental event, Google\u2019s computer program, known as AlphaGo, defeated the world champion Lee Sedol, in a complex strategy game, called Go. This is another significant milestone in the history of AI.",
    "You might now be questioning: Is AI merely a champion of games? What is the big deal? But unlike the previous chess victory, this victory marked a pivotal moment that started a new era in AI. Scientists had unveiled a revolutionary AI technology, that could solve real-world challenges beyond games.",
    "As one example, Google repurposed the computer program, that was originally used to win the Go competition, into a program called AlphaFold, to achieve a completely different objective. In 2020, AlphaFold made a breakthrough in a complex problem, that had challenged the scientific community for many decades: the protein-folding problem. Proteins are the building blocks of our body, which are responsible for many bodily functions. Currently, there are over 200 million known proteins, and more are being discovered daily. Understanding the structure of these proteins is vital for disease detection, drug discovery, and a myriad of other medical applications. AlphaFold, the AI-based solution, was able to rapidly and cost-effectively, understand the structure of a protein. Before this breakthrough, understanding the protein structure used to cost millions of dollars and years of research. This a pioneering leap in scientific discovery, a milestone duly recognised with publication in Nature, the premier journal at the forefront of scientific inquiry.",
