    "The last two weeks suggest that the NPP is moving to the centre, most probably in a bid to grapple with the challenges of a slim majority. The new government has announced that it will oppose the upcoming UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka. This indicates that it is moving to embrace the nationalist space that was previously held by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family, but has since bifurcated, if not trifurcated. As Harendra Dassanayake and Rajni Gamage recently observed, the Sinhala Buddhist space in Sri Lanka currently lacks a leader. The NPP appears to have caught the most vocally articulate sections of this milieu.",
    "What do these developments mean for Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy? It is difficult to ascertain which direction this government is headed. Since assuming office, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been greeting and meeting numerous ambassadors and diplomatic officials, from the US to Palestine. These engagements, however, tell us little about what the regime will finally do. The NPP\u2019s anti-establishment rhetoric will likely translate into major changes within the Foreign Service and diplomatic apparatus. Whether that will spill over to changes in foreign policy stricto sensu, however, is debatable.",
    "Ideologically, the NPP is the radical-liberal face of the JVP, just as the JVP is the dominant outfit of the NPP. Since coming to power, it has shifted considerably from what it used to believe in and stand for. On some issues, however, it has indicated that it will commit itself to what it said at election rallies. The most prominent of these is the Adani power plant project. Widely reviled and censured, by environmentalists and civil society as much as by nationalist political interests, the Adani project has run into a legal logjam here, mainly over concerns about the tender and bidding process.",
    "Sri Lanka has a long, infamous history of \u201crevisiting\u201d bilateral, even multilateral, agreements, including foreign investments. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government was no different to previous regimes in this regard, yet the depths to which it sank \u2013 cancelling the LRT deal with Japan \u2013 means that Sri Lanka can\u2019t afford a repetition. The Adani deal is different in that it has organically cultivated a bad press among many Sri Lankans \u2013 even those who think that the country must prioritise its relations with India. The NPP\u2019s rhetoric on the deal resonates with its anti-establishment and anti-corruption discourses. This is different to, say, the IMF agreement, which has its critics, but which is seen as important even if it has led to austerity measures being imposed on vulnerable communities.",
    "It is likely, then, that the NPP\u2019s foreign policy will be articulated strongly in its response to foreign investments. In his first public address, President Dissanayake prioritised stability and recovery. There are different ways of achieving stability and recovery, and one government\u2019s efforts will be different to another\u2019s. The JVP has historically viewed foreign investments with disfavour, reflecting the popular view of FDIs as exploitative and of little to no benefit to the country. It is likely that the NPP will moderate its position on such investments. However, even if it does so, it will have to grapple with the challenge of attracting FDIs in a context where the IMF has put an end to the regime of tax concessions and holidays that the Board of Investment had entrenched for decades, since the 1990s.",
    "This underlies a contradiction between Sri Lanka\u2019s aspirations to become an export-oriented economy and the general trajectory of IMF reforms. The NPP will find it difficult to resolve this, in particular given the burden of expectations it has been saddled with. However, this task, and that burden, is something the government will have to address for the rest of its term. As the backlash against the recent stamp incident suggests, even the most innocuous thing will be held against it, by its critics as much by its supporters. As it begins to commit itself to economic reforms, especially after the November election, it will thus have to meet the high standards that the public is measuring it against.",
    "The NPP\u2019s and JVP\u2019s populist-welfarist rhetoric underlies yet another contradiction, between its commitment to the IMF agreement and the resistance to some of the current economic reforms by the grassroots. Two of the most polarising reforms have been the tax hikes and the overhauling of social security, specifically Samurdhi. The NPP, or rather the JVP, has its strongest pockets in the Sinhala and Buddhist agrarian heartland: in the southwest quadrant, and across the north-west and north-central provinces. In these areas, social security and social safety mechanisms have become firmly embedded in the rural ecosystem. When the Ranil Wickremesinghe government tinkered with them, it opened itself up to the risk of electoral suicide. The NPP benefitted from this. It remains to be seen whether it will reverse the reforms of the previous administration in these areas.",
    "As these developments show clearly, the NPP\u2019s foreign policy will be determined by the current spate and future course of economic reforms. Some of the contradictions underlying these reforms are intrinsic: for instance, between the need to attract FDIs and the removal of tax concessions and exemptions on foreign investments. Others are extrinsic and have to do with the JVP-NPP\u2019s policy postures: for instance, the debate over raising tax thresholds from Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000. Moreover, as I mentioned before, the NPP government is saddled with the burden of expectations. It is responding to this burden in two ways: one, by providing relief for farmers and the middle-class, and two, by claiming the nationalist space that the Rajapaksas had previously occupied.",
    "The NPP has so far prided itself on its radical and liberal character. As the People\u2019s Struggle Alliance\u2019s poor electoral showing shows, virtue-signalling on single issues will not win any party or politician, even those ostensibly led by anti-establishment elements, political space. The NPP is now in power. It is in control of institutions that it previously critiqued as either corrupt or wasteful. What it does with these will have an impact on where it sees itself, and the country, in the world of today. The next two months are hence crucial.",
