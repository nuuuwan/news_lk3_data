    "The Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court, yesterday in its composition for the Situation in the State of Palestine,\u00a0 unanimously issued two decisions rejecting challenges by the State of Israel (\u2018Israel\u2019) brought under articles 18 and 19 of the Rome Statute (the \u2018Statute\u2019). It also issued warrants of arrest for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant.",
    "The Chamber ruled on two requests submitted by the Israel on 26 September. In the first request, Israel challenged the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the situation in the State of Palestine in general, and over Israeli nationals more specifically, on the basis of article 19(2) of the Statute. In the second request, Israel requested that the Chamber order the Prosecution to provide a new notification of the initiation of an investigation to its authorities under article 18(1) of the Statute. Israel also requested the Chamber to halt any proceedings before the Court in the relevant situation, including the consideration of the applications for warrants of arrest for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, submitted by the Prosecution on 20 May 2024.",
    "As to the first challenge, the Chamber noted that the acceptance by Israel of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is not required, as the Court can exercise its jurisdiction on the basis of territorial jurisdiction of Palestine, as determined by Pre-Trial Chamber I in a previous composition. Furthermore, the Chamber considered that pursuant to article 19(1) of the Statute, States are not entitled to challenge the Court\u2019s jurisdiction under article 19(2) prior to the issuance of a warrant of arrest. Thus Israel\u2019s challenge is premature. This is without prejudice to any future possible challenges to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and/or admissibility of any particular case."
