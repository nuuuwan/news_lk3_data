    "World Monuments Fund (WMF), the leading global independent organisation devoted to safeguarding the world\u2019s most treasured places, has officially endorsed the exhibition titled \u201888 Acres: The Watapuluwa Housing Scheme by Minnette De Silva\u2019 by the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Sri Lanka (MMCA Sri Lanka). The exhibition is currently on display at the museum on the ground floor of Crescat Boulevard, Colombo 3, and will be open to the public until 7 July 2024.",
    "Speaking of the recognition that the exhibition has received from WMF, Sharmini Pereira the Chief Curator at the MMCA Sri Lanka noted that, \u201cThe endorsement of WMF is a first for Sri Lankan modern architecture, and provides a much-needed boost to recognising local art and architectural histories of the global south at an international level.",
    "\u201d She added, \u201cMinnette De Silva was the first Asian female architect to be recognised by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1948. Critical recognition of her contribution to architecture did not happen during her lifetime, which makes this endorsement all the more significant. The MMCA Sri Lanka is honoured to work with WMF to further the research and discussion about De Silva\u2019s work.\u201d",
    "The Watapuluwa Housing Scheme in Kandy was completed in 1958, and heralded a new form of social housing in Sri Lanka. Designed by architect Minnette De Silva (1918\u20131998), the Scheme was notably created with the participation of its users. \u201888 Acres\u2019 explores how this sprawling hillside development was ahead of its time in providing affordable accommodation for a diverse ethno-religious community of government public servants in Sri Lanka. Alongside a specially commissioned artists\u2019 film by Irushi Tennekoon (b. 1989), Sumedha Kelegama (b. 1988), and Sumudu Athukorala (b. 1980), \u201888 Acres\u2019 looks back at the Scheme 65 years later to consider De Silva\u2019s influences and the challenges of her design approach.",
    "Addressing this milestone endorsement for both the MMCA Sri Lanka and WMF, John Darlington, the Director of Projects at World Monument Fund noted that, \u201cMinnette De Silva was an extraordinary architect. Brave, creative and years ahead of her time, she deserves recognition within Sri Lanka and globally.",
    "World Monuments Fund is delighted to endorse \u201888 Acres\u2019, which focuses on her Watapuluwa Housing Scheme, uniquely exploring it through the eyes of artists, friends, and those who live there.\u201d He further added, \u201cWe also look forward to working with the MMCA Sri Lanka, and other partners, to place a spotlight on Minnette\u2019s wider legacy, not just of buildings but of approach.\u201d",
    "\u201888 Acres: The Watapuluwa Housing Scheme by Minnette De Silva\u2019 features photographs, publications, historical documents, installations, and architectural drawings and models, alongside an artists\u2019 film titled \u2018is this an architectural documentary? (2023). This animated documentary will be screened throughout the day when \u201888 Acres\u2019 opens to the public from 30 November 2023 to 7 July 2024. The exhibition and the artists\u2019 film are both made possible through the funding of the British Council Sri Lanka.",
    "Expressing his support for the exhibition, Orlando Edwards, Director of British Council Sri Lanka said, \u201cWe are proud to be supporting the MMCA Sri Lanka\u2019s new exhibition titled \u201888 Acres\u2019. The recognition from the World Monuments Fund (WMF) and the emerging partnership with the MMCA Sri Lanka is excellent news for Sri Lankan architecture and heritage, and the importance of raising the profile of one of Sri Lanka\u2019s unsung architects, Minnette De Silva.\u201d He added, \u201cAt the British Council we believe in the value of bringing design to a wider audience, challenging perceptions, and responding to social, political, and environmental contexts, and \u201888 Acres\u2019 does just that.\u2019\u2019",
    "The MMCA Sri Lanka is an education-led initiative that aims to establish a public museum dedicated to the display, research, collection, and conservation of modern and contemporary art for the benefit and enjoyment of the general public, schools, and tourists.",
    "The museum is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm (except on Poya days and public holidays) on the ground floor of Crescat Boulevard, Colombo 3, and the entrance to the museum and all its public programmes are free. Information about the museum and its exhibitions and public programmes can be found via its website www.mmca-srilanka.org, or on Facebook at facebook.com/mmcasrilanka and Instagram at instagram.com/mmcasrilanka/.",
