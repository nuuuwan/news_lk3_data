    "Today, we commemorate the fifth anniversary of my eternally cherished wife Dr Malwattage Josephine Sarojini Perera (nee Peeris) leaving this mortal world. It has been five years of intense desolation and loneliness for all of us in the family, as well as our friends since she left this planet Earth. However, the memories of her life remain vivid; her ever-present spirit is\u00a0so much with us, and her heritage is eternally enduring. She was ever so beautiful in her physical profile as much as from deep within the interior of her human form. She was not merely a remarkable individual, but a dazzling beacon of compassion, an embodiment of love, and an eternal source of inspiration for those fortunate enough to cross paths with her.",
    "Sarojini was a woman of extraordinary grace and kindness, whose ever-so-radiant smile regularly and persistently illuminated the lives of those around her. As it goes in the song Candida, \u201cStars would not come out if she was around as they could not even match the glow of that wonderful smile.\u201d Her inner beauty shone brightly, mirroring the purity of her soul, just through that beaming smile. Shakespeare aptly wrote in Antony and Cleopatra, \u201cAge cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.\u201d Indeed, Sarojini was the epitome of an immeasurable variety of virtues; compassion, empathy, resilience, love, and unwavering dedication to her calling. She was a gift to humanity from the Good Lord above for a fantastic lifetime of 72 years 2 months and 11 days; a phenomenal journey of sparkling splendour.",
    "Throughout her life, she exemplified the essence of service, devoting herself wholeheartedly to all of us in her immediate family, as well as those in her extended family, all her relatives and friends and not least of all, her patients. For all of them, she was the essence of the abiding power of hope. Her chosen path led her to work tirelessly with individuals afflicted and affected by HIV and AIDS; a population marginalised and stigmatised very often, by society. Yet, this lady of ours approached her work with boundless empathy and a profound sense of humane care. She was the personification of a very clear understanding that behind every diagnosis was a person who deserved dignity, respect, and affection.",
    "As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, \u201cTo thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man\u201d, the lady remained true to her principles, steadfast in her commitment to alleviate suffering and foster understanding. Her patients were not just recipients of medical care; they were embraced by her as members of her extended family. Sarojini\u2019s gentle demeanour and compassionate nature endeared her to all who sought solace in her indulgence. She provided not only medical treatment but also emotional support, serving as a beacon of hope in times of utter darkness and despair for those who sought her help. In the words of Shakespeare from Romeo and Juliet, \u201cLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs\u2026\u2026,\u201d and indeed in her case, Sarojini\u2019s love emanated as a healing balm, comforting the souls of those sighing in terrible anguish.",
    "Beyond her professional endeavours, Sarojini was a loving wife, a devoted mother, and a precious friend. Our home was a sanctuary of warmth and affection, where love flourished, and laughter filled the air. She nurtured her family with boundless fondness, instilling in them the precious values of kindness, integrity, and resilience. She would remain calm even through grave adversities and take steps to settle even the disturbed. Her love continues to live on in the hearts of her family, a timeless bond that even transcends the bounds of mortality and impermanence of life.",
    "As we reflect on Sarojini\u2019s remarkable life and the bequest she left behind, we try ever so hard, not to dwell on the sadness of her absence but instead celebrate the beauty of her existence. Of course, we miss her terribly. She may have left this mortal world, but her spirit remains eternally intertwined with ours, guiding us with her wisdom and inspiring us with her grace. Sarojini\u2019s life was a testament to the power of eternal love, compassion, and service; a gift that continues to illuminate our path and enrich our lives.",
    "Real beauty is not only what the eyes can behold but also what the heart can hold. What we see with our eyes will vanish someday, but what we store in our hearts will forever stay. Many people, myself included, have tried ever so hard to use many adjectives and descriptive exaltations to portray this wonderful person that was Sarojini. Yet for all that, we could write reams on her but even through such an endeavour, we will never be able to paint a realistic picture that would describe her even in a million words. As for me, I had the singular privilege of holding the most gorgeous lady in my arms for all those lovely years from courtship to her ultimate demise. Yet for all that, memories are forever and I will always remember her life on earth as a beautiful melody that would never fade and would linger on forever.",
    "We do try our best to honour Sarojini\u2019s memory by embodying the virtues she so wonderfully and effortlessly exemplified; compassion, humane kindness, unbridled love, and steadfast dedication to serving others. That is of crucial significance to all of us as they have thrown away the mould in which she was made and that is what makes her uniqueness to be a vision of intense grandeur. Though she may no longer walk amongst us, her essence remains, alive in the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing her. As the great bard wrote in The Twelfth Night, \u201cIn my stars, I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.\u201d Dr Sarojini Perera had greatness thrust upon her as a result of her selfless deeds and her profound impact on the lives of those she touched.",
    "Darling Sara, your eternal legacy will go far beyond your time with us. Your greatest victory in life was to have been such a wonderful, lovely and caring person. It has been said that every smile, every loving word and every kind action, is a reflection of the beauty of a soul. In your case, that beauty was so unique, it was so much you. You will always be the epitome of that citation as the ripples of your life will continue to be nurtured in the hearts and souls of all who had the superlative fortune and the superlative privilege to come into contact with you.",
    "May your heritage continue to inspire us to live with love, compassion, and integrity while honouring your memory with every act of kindness and every moment of grace. We do believe that you, the Queen of our Hearts, so safe now in the kingdom of your creator, are looking down on us through your eternally benevolent eyes and guiding us through our sojourn on Mother Earth.",
