    "Colombo, April 23 (Daily Mirror) - Some MPs from both Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have reportedly brokered liquor licences from the government for their cronies for hefty commissions involved, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "The matter came to light after the religious leaders of some districts like Kandy inquired about the purported plans to set up liquor shops and those who helped securing licenses.",
    "In one instance, the prospective businessmen have cited the names of a few SJB MPs who helped them in getting licences. Incensed by the move, the matter has been brought to the notice of SJB leader Sajith Premadasa who has reportedly promised to look into it.",
    "Also, the matter is likely to be raised at the parliamentary group meeting this evening.",
    "It is common knowledge that licences for opening liquor shops are issued under political patronage. Also, politicians from different hues own such shops directly or through their proxies.",
    "Meanwhile, the SJB parliamentary group is likely to be tense since party\u2019s General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara is slated to question the MPs who received financial allocations from the government to carry out development work in their respective electorates without approval from the party leadership."
