    "The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) and Germany\u2019s Import Promotion Desk (IPD) will formalise their longstanding collaboration through a Cooperation Agreement, expanding support to Sri Lanka\u2019s digital products and services sector alongside natural ingredients and processed foods.",
    "Since 2019, EDB and IPD have partnered to strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s export competitiveness, particularly in natural ingredients. Their joint initiatives have enabled small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to meet European Union (EU) market requirements, improve compliance, and establish valuable buyer connections.",
    "During the visit to Colombo from 8\u201312 September 2025, IPD Head Dr. Julia Bellinghausen met with EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe and senior officials to review achievements and discuss future priorities. She also held discussions with German Embassy in Sri Lanka Deputy Head of Mission Sarah Hasselbarth, focusing on SME development and strengthening EDB\u2019s advisory role in export promotion.",
    "Accompanying Dr. Bellinghausen was IPD Germany Expert Sourcing and Sector Lead \u2013 Digital Products and Services Stefan Schutze Tobar, who visited Sri Lankan IT service providers to assess their export potential and identify companies suitable for inclusion in IPD\u2019s matchmaking program, which links IT service SMEs with European buyers.",
    "EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe said, \u201cThis partnership has already delivered concrete market linkages and institutional know-how. The expansion into digital products and services will enable Sri Lankan SMEs to access new opportunities in Europe, while building on our success in natural ingredients.\u201d",
    "IPD Head Dr. Julia Bellinghausen said, \u201cSri Lanka has dynamic SMEs and promising export potential. Through this cooperation, we aim to provide long-term, sustainable market access opportunities for Sri Lankan companies in Europe, while also strengthening EDB\u2019s role as a key export promotion agency.\u201d",
    "Over the past five years, the partnership has produced tangible results. Sri Lankan exporters of essential oils, spices, coconut-based products and processed foods have been introduced to leading European buyers through sourcing missions and trade fairs such as Biofach and Anuga. Training workshops and coaching programs have prepared exporters to meet sustainability standards, buyer expectations and regulatory requirements. Special initiatives to support women-led businesses have enabled female entrepreneurs to enter European markets, while train-the-trainer programs have enhanced the capacity of EDB officers to provide advisory services across the country.",
    "The new Cooperation Agreement will provide a structured framework to scale up these efforts by extending IPD\u2019s advisory and matchmaking services to digital products and services sector, while continuing support for natural ingredients and processed foods. It will also strengthen SME capacity through tailored coaching on EU market entry strategies, sustainability and export documentation, and enhance EDB\u2019s institutional expertise with collaborative training aligned to European market regulations. In addition, the agreement will facilitate curated B2B matchmaking sessions, sourcing missions and greater participation in leading international trade fairs.",
    "The partnership underscores the growing role of digital products and services as a driver of export growth for Sri Lanka while reinforcing the country\u2019s traditional strengths in natural ingredients and processed foods."
