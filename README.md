### New Government faces tough questions over IMF U-turn

*2024-12-04 05:41:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-Government-faces-tough-questions-over-IMF-U-turn/4-770049) · `en`

Can the Government implement the IMF’s reforms in a way that minimises their impact on vulnerable populations?

When the NPP party swept into power just a couple of months ago, it did so on a wave of hope and promises of change. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s campaign was built on sharp critiques of past economic mismanagement and vows to steer the country towards a more equitable future. Yet, in a move that has surprised many supporters, the new Government has chosen to accept the IMF bailout terms negotiated by its predecessor—a decision that underscores the scale of the challenges it faces.

### Inland Revenue Dept. should understand plight of contractors

*2024-12-04 05:38:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Inland-Revenue-Dept-should-understand-plight-of-contractors/4-770047) · `en`

VAT payments in the construction industry work in strange and sometimes unfair ways

Some Inland Revenue Department (IRD) officers have misunderstood that contractors’ bills have been settled as per their satisfaction. This is a myth, because although a portion of contractors’ dues have been paid by previous Governments, these bills have been stagnant for two or three years. By that time, bank interests have eaten up all of their profits and have pushed them towards great losses. Further, many bills remain uncertified and these have not been settled for contractors. In such a context, some IRD officers have quoted statements regarding the settlement of these old dues to pursue contractors for tax payments within unreasonable time periods.

### Cabinet approves new bill to recall and reopen nominations for LG polls

The bill aims to nullify the nominations called for the election initially scheduled for 2023 and create provisions for new nominations. A consensus to proceed with this approach was reached at a party leaders’ meeting chaired by the Speaker of Parliament on 25 November.

### Tides, from Colombo to Arugam Bay

*2024-12-04 04:14:46* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Tides-from-Colombo-to-Arugam-Bay/4-770035) · `en`

Arugam Bay is no Gaza, thankfully, but Chabad-Lubavitch members are bringing Gaza into Arugam Bay – just as Maccabi Tel Aviv fans brought Gaza into Amsterdam

They are back, creeping of the woodwork. The gathering outside Colombo’s main railway station was mercifully small, just the mandatory monk and a handful of civilians. Having offered flowers to a statue of the Buddha, they proceeded to violate his teachings by trying to ignite an ethno-religious fire. Their target was the welcome decision by the NPP/JVP Government to release some of the military-occupied land in the north to their original owners.

The monk accused President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of being a diaspora agent trying to rejuvenate the Tigers and start the next Eelam War. Madubhashana Prabath, the secretary of Sinhala Ravaya, called the new president King Elara of Tambuttegama and promised to struggle till the ‘last drop of blood’ to ‘save the nation’.
