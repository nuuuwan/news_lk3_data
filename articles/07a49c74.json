    "Reinforcing its leadership in sports infrastructure development, DIMO has successfully completed the installation of Sri Lanka\u2019s first and second LED floodlighting systems at two of the country\u2019s most iconic cricket stadiums. The first installation was completed at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium (RDICS) in 2023, followed by the second at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium (RPICS) in Colombo in 2025.",
    "This milestone builds on DIMO\u2019s historic achievement in the 1980s, when it made global headlines by installing Sri Lanka\u2019s first and the world\u2019s second floodlighting system at RPICS, cementing its legacy as a pioneer in sports lighting technology.",
    "As stadiums across the world transition to advanced LED lighting technology, Sri Lanka Cricket has also begun upgrading its international cricket venues with LED floodlighting systems. This move replaces the country\u2019s decades-old conventional systems, marking a significant leap forward in modernising Sri Lanka\u2019s sports infrastructure.",
    "The new LED systems meet the International Cricket Council (ICC) standards required for day-night and televised matches, ensuring optimal illumination levels for international gameplay and high-definition broadcasting. Featuring uniform lighting, consistent color temperature, and glare control, the systems support 4K and 8K broadcasts, delivering crystal-clear visuals to both stadium spectators and global TV audiences. Additionally, flicker-free technology enhances slow-motion replays and critical tools like the Decision Review System (DRS), while significantly improving player safety and visibility during fast-paced night-time matches.",
    "Beyond performance, the systems deliver notable operational and environmental benefits. Compared to conventional metal-halide lamps, the LED technology offers a longer lifespan, reduced energy consumption, lower heat emission, and decreased maintenance requirements. With no hazardous substances such as mercury, the systems are also safer to dispose of and more environmentally friendly.",
    "Advanced features include zoned lighting control for partial stadium use during training and maintenance, along with a sophisticated digital dimming system that enables dynamic lighting effects for ceremonies and entertainment events.",
    "DIMO executed a full-scale transformation at RPICS by installing a cutting-edge LED floodlighting system, which included 660 high-performance LED floodlights for the main field and 72 for the practice nets. The project encompassed all electrical, civil, and mechanical works\u2014including the safe removal of existing masts and erection of new 58-meter-high heavy-duty steel towers\u2014completed with zero incidents while maintaining the highest standards of health and safety.",
    "At RDICS, approximately 1,100 meters of cabling were laid around the ground, with a further 52,800 meters inside the towers. At RPICS, the installation involved 1,780 meters of ground-level cabling and 56,100 meters within the towers, ensuring seamless functionality and system reliability.",
    "\u201cThe ICC\u2019s illumination requirements for night-time international cricket have been fully met through DIMO\u2019s turnkey delivery of these advanced LED floodlighting systems, reflecting our commitment to bringing global technologies to local infrastructure. With the proven capability of DIMO\u2019s Lighting Solutions team, specialized in Lighting Projects and their experience in executing several national-scale projects in the country\u2019s infrastructure development sphere, we continue to raise industry standards in design, installation, and performance,\u201d said Mr. Wijith Pushpawela, Executive Director of DIMO.",
