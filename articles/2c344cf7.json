    "As per our view, at the upcoming policy meeting, there is an 80% probability for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to maintain rates at the current levels, allowing further strengthening of key economic indicators, say Dimantha Mathew and Anjali Mathews, analysts at First Capital Research.",
    "In their report titled, \u201cThe Road ahead: Steering Interest rates in an uncertain economy\u2019. They say, \u201cThere is, however, a 20% probability for CBSL to relax the policy rates, with a probability of 15% for a rate cut of 25bps and a lower level of 5% for 50bps rate cut in order to further reduce rates and government security yields to accelerate economic growth.",
    "\u201cFurther, there is an 80% probability to keep SRR unchanged; while considering the improved liquidity levels in the system, we consider a 20% probability for a SRR hike of 100bps.\u201d",
    "\u201cConsidering the reduction of SRR by 200bps to 2.0% on 09th Aug-23, we expect SRR to remain unchanged at the same level. However, there is a 20% probability for CBSL to raise SRR by 100bps.\u201d",
    "\u201cPartly in line with our expectations, CBSL decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25bps to 8.25% and 9.25%, respectively at the monetary policy review held on 23rd Jul-24. The Board reached this conclusion after thoroughly examining the present and anticipated trends in both the domestic and global economy. The objective is to maintain inflation at the targeted level below 5.0% over the medium term, all while supporting the economy in reaching its potential level. The Board acknowledged that inflation is expected to remain well below the target in the coming months due to the adjustments of electricity tariffs, falling domestic food prices, and weak demand conditions. Despite a widening of the trade balance, the external sector has shown improvement with increased foreign currency inflows, tourism-related inflows, and elevated workers\u2019 remittances.",
    "However, the Board emphasized the need to continue to ease monetary conditions to sustain the revival of economic activity towards full potential in the absence of significant inflationary pressures, and will continue to monitor inflation developments\u201d. the report states.",
    "Key Arguments considered by CBSL for its policy stance held on 23rd Jul-24",
    "Inflation is expected to remain well below the targeted level over the medium term The CBSL will continue to monitor inflation and adjust rates as needed",
    "The external sector continued to strengthen amidst a widening trade deficit.",
