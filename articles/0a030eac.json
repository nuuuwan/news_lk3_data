    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka can achieve 10 percent growth in 10 years if it dismantles the walls around its economy and starts building bridges instead, particularly to rapidly growing neighbouring regions like South India, opposition MP Harsha de Silva said, also acknowledging that President Ranil Wickremesinge has made some difficult achievements.",
    "\u201cCan we bring 10 percent growth in 10 years? Yes, we can. How we do it is the question. What would be the programme? Break down the walls surrounding the country and build bridges. That\u2019s number one. Nothing can be done without it,\u201d the MP said at a press conference on Wednesday May 15.",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) legislator said South India is a notable example.",
    "\u201cLook at South India and its growth. The Tamil Nadu economy is projected to grow to 1 trillion US dollars by 2030. Now, because I said this, some man had gone and said \u2018Harsha de Silva said the country should join Tamil Nadu\u2019. What two-bit politicians are these if they can\u2019t understand such a concept?\u201d",
    "The five South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Telengana are collectively the most rapidly developing region in the world, de Silva said.",
    "\u201cThese may not be countries, but they are as big. Cities like Chennai may have a population comparable to ours. These fives states are developing rapidly. We\u2019re above 20 kilometres south of this region. What are supposed to do?\u201d",
    "Growth in South India will accelerate over a period of 10 to 15 years, de Silva, the SJB\u2019s top economic policymaker, said, adding that Sri Lanka must cash in.",
    "\u201cSo what do we do? Do we hate them? Do we laugh at them? Do we criticise them? Or do we work together with them and get something out of it for ourselves? That\u2019s what I propose.",
    "\u201cIf it is our neighbour that is developing the fastest, why on earth should we not benefit from that?\u201d he said.",
    "The MP\u2019s comments come amid growing pushback from leftist parties and nationalist outfits on proposed Indian investments in the Sri Lankan economy, particularly in the energy sector.",
    "Insisting that he is a pragmatic person, de Silva said that achieving 10 percent growth is entirely within the realm of possibility.",
    "Responding to questions from reporters, de Silva that political parties cannot keep making statements with the election in mind.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t keep saying things looking at the election. Difficult things have to be done. For example, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has done a lot of difficult things. We have to accept that,\u201d he said.",
    "Rival opposition party leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has ackowledged that Wickremesinghe has \u201ccrossed half the suspension bridge\u201d and must keep moving with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "\u201cWhat did they say before? They said no country that worked with the IMF succeeded. But what did we say? We said from the get go to go to the IMF,\u201d said de Silva. (Colombo/May17/2024)"
