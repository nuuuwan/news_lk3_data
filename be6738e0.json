    "The Commanding Officer of the Indian Naval submarine, Commander Divakar. S will call on Commander Western Naval Area, Rear Admiral Suresh De Silva. Further, during the submarine\u2019s visit the vessel would be open for visitors and school children.",
    "The High Commission of India in coordination with Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre is scheduled to organise a grand event at Colombo Port to celebrate IDY on 21 June 2023 with participation of senior defence hierarchy and personnel from Indian and Sri Lanka Navies. The Indian Navy is participating in the 9th edition of IDY with the unique initiative of performing Yoga on selected ports across the world forming a \u2018Global Ocean Ring\u2019. Connecting people the world over in a common pursuit of wellness, IDY 2023 resonates with the theme of India\u2019s ongoing presidency of the G20, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or \u2018One Earth, One Family, One Future\u2019.",
    "Further, it may be recalled that Indian Naval Ships Delhi, Sukanya, Kiltan and Savitri had earlier visited Colombo and Trincomalee earlier this year, during which Yoga sessions were organised with Sri Lanka Navy. Recently, in June 2023, Sri Lankan Armed Forces participated in the three-day Yoga workshop across five cities in Sri Lanka, which was organised by Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre. Visits by Indian Navy ships and submarines in Sri Lanka aim to foster brotherhood and togetherness between the two neighbouring navies in keeping with the India\u2019s vision of \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy and \u2018Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR)\u2019."
