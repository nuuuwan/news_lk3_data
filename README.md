### America has two presidents as the world braces for another Trump term

*2024-12-09 16:04:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/america-has-two-presidents-as-the-world-braces-for-another-trump-term/) ¬∑ `en`

The election of Donald Trump as US President for yet another term has sent many world leaders scurrying for cover. Especially in the West. But even China is concerned. In the US itself, the longstanding maxim that there can only be one president at a time is being put to the test every day. Joe Biden, the outgoing president, is scrambling to salvage his legacy after a disastrous last year that has diminished all his achievements over the first three years on the domestic front.

Externally, Biden‚Äôs presidency has been a monumental failure, from the impulsive withdrawal from Afghanistan that kickstarted it, to the hopelessly painful stalemate in Ukraine and the relentless mass devastation in Gaza that are dragging out its end. With the pardoning of his son Hunter Biden, the outgoing president has ceded even the little moral hump that he had over Trump.

Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and External Affairs (July 1960 ‚Äî August 1965)

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Working with S W R D Bandaranaike in the 1956-1959 period had given me the opportunity of appreciating the many-faceted character of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was a devoted mother to her three children, ran her very busy and sometimes even chaotic household with a firm hand and had developed an understanding with her husband which allowed him to engage in his political pursuits with minimum interference.

### The Nehru Letters: Correspondence between Pandit Nehru and JRJ between 1940-1947

One of my treasured possessions has been my correspondence with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister and maker of modern India. These were a collection of letters exchanged between us between 1940 and 1947. In July 1971, in response to an appeal published in the newspapers by Mrs Indira Gandhi, I forwarded photostat copies of the correspondence to her. I also sent her a letter explaining the spirit and framework of the correspondence. The collection of letters is reproduced here, as a token of my treasured recollections of one of the most remarkable leaders I was privileged to know.

Donald Trump will spend the next three months finalising his Cabinet. He will assume office on January 20, and, if we are to believe what he says, will start implementing his America First policy by imposing some of the most extensive tariffs ever enforced by the United States. He has promised to impose them not just on China, but also Mexico and Canada ‚Äì unless the latter two do something about illegal immigration to America.

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



"Excise licenses granted under rules. Gov't earns 3.1Bn in 9 months. Fees increased & new amendments implemented Feb 2024. Annual permit fee: 1Mn. Liquor licenses auctioned, 25% fund for relaxation measures. Court case on license issuance due to public complaints."

üü©

In a statement issued by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's office, all the licenses are granted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Department of Excise.

The announcement also stated that the total income earned by the government in the nine months through the prosecuting Uri Mangal will be over 3.1 billion rupees.

After independence, the government did not charge money to grant the excise license until 2022. By then, the tendency to lose direct taxes in the country was shown. At the time, the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Ways told the government to take appropriate action to get rid of the country's rigorous economic bankruptcy. Accordingly, as an alternative to the immediate direct tax loss, it was decided to increase the government's revenue, collect money and grant the excise license.

### Tonga‚Äôs prime minister quits moments ahead of no-confidence motion in parliament

Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.

His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between Tonga‚Äôs monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010.

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-09 13:18:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) ¬∑ `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.

### Remittance inflows face twin declines: month-on-month and year-on-year

Workers‚Äô remittances amounted to US dollars 530.1 mn in November 2024, compared to US dollars 587.7 mn in October 2024, and US dollars 537.3 mn in November 2023, according to the Weekly Economic Indicators of the Central Bank.

This means that remittance inflows have declined by US$ 57 million month-on-month, and by US$ 7 million year-on-year in spite of the fact that more migrant workers are supposedly remitting their money to Sri Lanka.

However, there is an encouraging ray of hope for the domestic economy as earnings from tourism have amounted to US dollars 272.9 mn in November 2024, compared to US dollars 185.6 mn in October 2024 and US dollars 205.3 mn in November 2023.

Another metric that adds to this optimism is during the year up to 06th December 2024, the Sri Lanka rupee has appreciated against the US dollar by 11.5 per cent.
