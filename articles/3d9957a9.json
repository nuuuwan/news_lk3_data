    "There are numerous stories told around the life and times of the Buddha some of which, unfortunately, belittle His great achievements. Perhaps, some are due to the enthusiasm of the chroniclers who were keen to elevate the Buddha, greatest human being ever lived, to that of a superhuman. Some others appear to be purposeful gross distortions driven by self-interest and the need for self-preservation, even at the expense of the Buddha. Perhaps, the biggest distortion of all is the story regarding the establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sasana and it is timely to discuss this as, according to tradition, Bhikkhuni Sasana commenced on Binara Poya day, which was celebrated this year on 07 Sept.",
    "It is said that Maha Prajapathi Gothami, with 500 other women who had already renounced lay life, made representation to the Buddha requesting the establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sasana and he refused to comply with their request thrice. Undaunted, they followed the Buddha to the next stop and were waiting outside where Buddha resided, tired and with bleeding feet due to walking, till Venerable Ananda took up their cause. Even then the Buddha was reluctant, but Venerable Ananda was able to persuade, with great difficulty, after reminding the Buddha that it was Maha Prajapathi Gothami, who suckled! Can you believe that the Buddha, who is supposed to have gazed, for a week, at the Bodhi Tree under which He attained enlightenment as an act of gratitude, forgot that his aunt had brought him up after the death of his mother?",
    "It is also said that the Buddha imposed eight conditions, one of which is that a Bhikkhuni with even hundred years of higher ordination should bow to a Bhikkhu who just got higher ordination. Can you believe the Buddha, who denounced the hierarchical caste system by stating that one becomes a Brahmin not by birth but by action to be so discriminatory towards women? He may have stipulated conditions for the protection of women, who were even more vulnerable than today. There is historical evidence to suggest that many young men from Brahmin families entered Bhikkhu hood, after the Parinibbana of the Buddha, as it was lucrative and it is quite possible that one of them may well be the author of the story!",
    "The biggest flaw in the story is what the Buddha is supposed to have told Venerable Ananda after agreeing to the establishment of Bhikkhuni Sasana. He is supposed to have said \u201cAnanda, by this action of yours, you have shortened the lifespan of my Sasana from a thousand to five hundred years\u201d How did the Buddha get it so wrong? The Sasana has already lasted over two thousand five hundred years!",
    "It is not only these contradictory statements that makes one not believe in this story but also the other evidence as to how the Buddha referred to women in his teachings, stressing equality. I am very thankful to my good friend, Dr Upali Abeysiri, who pointed out these facts.",
    "When Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha, \u201cIf a woman were to go forth from the household to homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Enlightened One, would it be possible for her to realize the fruit of stream entry, the fruit of once returner, the fruit of non-returner and the fruit of Arahantship?\u201d the Buddha\u2019s reply was \u201cIt would be, Ananda\u201d",
    ", in the Majjima Nikaya, highlights the Buddha\u2019s praise of Venerable Dhammadinna. Her former husband asked her many questions, and mentioned her answers to the Buddha, who said his explanations would be identical, praising her knowledge.",
    "According to the Sabrahma Sutta in Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha stated, \u201cBrahmathi Matha Pithero\u201d meaning that both mother and father are equal to Brahma. Note Matha comes first.",
    "The Buddha walked behind the cortege of his stepmother Maha Prajapathi Gothami, the only time he did so ever. No religious leader has done that in ancient India. How can we believe that the Buddha disregarded her request?",
    "Considering all these facts, it is pretty obvious that the long-perpetuated story about the establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sasana is a misrepresentation, done most likely for self-interest! Interestingly, the difficulties the Bhikkhuni Sasana faced did not end there.",
    "In view of the tremendous success of the Bhikkhu Sasana he established in Lanka, Arahant Mahinda requested his father, Emperor Ashoka to send his sister Sanghamitta to establish Bhikkhuni Sasana.",
    "Not only did she do that, starting with Queen Anula, she brought a sapling of the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment, which still stands as the oldest verified angiosperm. However, Bhikkhuni Sasana went into decline following the Polonnaruwa period. This was not in isolation as Bhikkhuni Sasana disappeared from most of the Theravada countries. Fortunately, it survived in some East Asian countries.",
    "Women had to fight a long and hard battle and ultimately in 1996, through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, the Theravada Bhikkhuni order was revived. Eleven Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a ceremony held by Ven. Dodangoda Revata Mahathera and Ven. Mapalagama Vipulasara Mahathera of the Mahabodhi Society in India, with assistance from monks and nuns of the Korean Chogye order. This happened in spite of objections by the Buddhist hierarchy.",
    "The situation in Thailand was worse. A law enacted in 1928 banning the ordination of women was reversed only recently and the first Thai Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka in 2003. Ajahn Brahm, a frequent visitor to Sri Lanka, was instrumental in the establishment of Bhikkhuni order, with Bhante Sujato, in the Forest Lineage of Ajahn Chah but the ordination ceremony led to Ajahn Brahm\u2019s expulsion from that Thai Forest Lineage! However, he now has a flourishing Bhikkhuni monastery in Western Australia.",
    "In spite of objections from Maha Nayakas of various Nikayas, Bhikkhuni Sasana has prospered in Sri Lanka mostly due to the efforts of Ven. Inamaluwe Sri Sumangala Thero, Maha Nayaka of Rangiri Dambulla Chapter of Siyam Maha Nikaya. A recent monumental decision by the Supreme Court has confirmed the re-establishment of Bhikkhuni Sasana in 1998 as explained in my piece \u201cBuddhism, Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis\u201d (The Island, 10 July).",
    "Most Buddhists, I believe, strongly feel that a vibrant Bhikkhuni Sasana would contribute towards the preservation of Buddha Sasana and the propagation of the message of the Buddha.",
