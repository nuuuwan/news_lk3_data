සාමාන්‍ය කට වහරේ කියවෙන කතාවක් තමයි ''අඳුරේදී ඔබගේ සෙවණැල්ල වුව ඔබව හැරදා යයි'' නම් කියමන.

ඒත් අද (07) හිරු එළිය පතිතව තිබියදීම එළිමහනේ සිටින අයගේ සෙවණැල්ලත් කෙටි වේලාවකට අතුරුදන්වුණි.

පෘථිවිය සූර්යයා වටා පරිභ්‍රමණයේදී ඇතැම් අවස්ථාවල පෘථිවියේ ඇතැම් ස්ථානවලට හිරු මුදුන්වීම සිදුවෙයි.

එවන් අවස්ථාවල පෘථිවියේ ඇතැම් ස්ථානවලට හිරු කිරණ සිරස්ව එල්ලවීම නිසා එම ස්ථානවල පවතින වස්තූන්ගේ සෙවණැල්ල තාවකාලිකව අතුරුදන්වීම සිදුවෙයි.

මේ වසරේ අප්‍රේල් මස 05 වනදා සිට අප්‍රේල් 15 දින දක්වා දින 10ක කාලයක් සූර්යයා ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට මුදුන්ව ගමන් ගනී.

ඒ අතරින් අද (07) මධ්‍යහන 12.12ට හිරු මුදුන්ව පැවතීමේ ප්‍රතිඵලයක් ලෙස යම් වස්තුවක සෙවනැල්ල නොපෙනී යන අතර එළිමහනේ සිටින අයගේ සෙවණැල්ල එක් මොහොතකට අතුරුදන් වන ආකාරය දැකගත හැකිවුණි.

මෙම අවස්ථාව නිරීක්ෂණය සඳහා විශ්ලේෂණ මධ්‍යස්ථානයක් තාරකා විද්‍යාඥයන් අද දින ගංගාරාම සීමා මාලකයේ සූදානම් කර තිබුණි.

අඩියක් පමණ වන කම්බි කූරක් වැනි යමක් මධ්‍යහ්නට පෙර එළිමහනේ සෘජුව සිටවා එහි සෙවණැල්ල අධීක්ෂණය මගින් මේ තත්ත්වය නිරීක්ෂණය කෙරුණි.

### Peter Pellegrini: Russia-friendly populist elected Slovak president

Populist Peter Pellegrini has been elected president of Slovakia, succeeding the liberal Zuzana Caputova.

Mr Pellegrini, 48, defeated the pro-Western Ivan Korcok, a former diplomat, with 53% of the vote.

A former prime minister, he is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and shares the PM’s dovish attitude towards Russia.

Mr Fico and his allies now control Slovakia’s parliament, government and soon the president’s office.

Slovakia had been one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies before Mr Fico came to power in October on a pledge to halt supplies of Slovak Army military stocks to Kyiv. With Mr Pellegrini replacing Mrs Caputova, Ukraine has now definitively lost a voice of support in an EU and Nato capital.

Mr Fico has called for an end to Western military support for Ukraine, an immediate ceasefire and peace talks with Moscow. Mr Fico said recently President Vladimir Putin had been "unfairly demonised" and argued admitting Ukraine to Nato would mark the beginning of a third world war.
