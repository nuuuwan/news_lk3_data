These perspectives have emboldened Indian fishermen to violate maritime boundaries and destroy marine resources by resorting to bottom trawling

The opportunity presented by the forthcoming visit of President Dissanayake to India should not be missed by the new Government because all previous Governments and their advisors have failed to address this all-important issue, either because of their timidity or ignorance of relevant international laws. If Dissanayake fails to inform India that Sri Lanka has no option but to seek the assistance of the ICJ to resolve the issue of maritime boundaries, Sri Lanka will have to accept the bitter prospect of the plunder of its resources and the sovereign rights of the people and the nation forever

### Heavenly duties or hellish efforts?

*2024-12-14 00:04:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Heavenly-duties-or-hellish-efforts/4-770511) · `en`

The country, once hopeful, stagnates; never achieving a growth rate that promises a break through

“The world is what it is, men who are nothing, who allow themselves to be nothing, have no place in it”   – V.S. Naipaul

I have a distant memory of reading a light-hearted description of heaven and hell, in common belief an inevitable destination for all earthlings; those who lead unsullied lives are directed to the former; botch your book, the man is hightailed to hell.

These two places are obviously ‘constructs’ of the human imagination, by human standards and outlook, the ecstasies promised and the tortures threatened are not only of human concept but are also distinctly period defined (are there personal computers in either place?). There cannot be two more dissimilar destinations in the after-life, heaven is a joyous place of endless pleasures and creature comforts, while hell is all agony, suffering and torture.

While the domestically disgruntled political elements are looking for opportunities to make life difficult for President AKD and his NPP Government those very elements could become tools at the hands of foreign elements with their own strategic agenda

On 21 August 2024 ‘Colombo Telegraph’ published an article titled, “Will the old order accept AKD victory?” The reason for raising that question then was because, of all the 39 contestants in the race for Presidency, including the two front runners Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) and Sajith Premadasa (SP), only AKD stood for something radically different. While all the others had exhibited no understanding of the root cause of the poly-crises that plagued the nation and promising blindly to tackle them rather spasmodically with the help of foreign agencies and advisors, only AKD was advocating something entirely different.

We were told that the Prevention of Terrorism Act would be completely abolished. However, at present, they have eliminated freedom of speech, media freedom, and civil liberties by utilising the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Is it fair to conduct media raids using the Prevention of Terrorism Act? During the election, the current Government received a significant support from the social media sector. Yet now, they are using the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which they promised to remove, to hunt down social media activists. We propose that if they mean what they say, they should stop this repression

### Macron names François Bayrou as French PM after government collapse

French President Emmanuel Macron named key ally Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday, but the scale of the challenge facing the veteran centrist was immediately clear as the Socialist Party refused to join his coalition government.

Bayrou, 73, gave a sober assessment of whether he could tame a hung parliament that ousted his predecessor, Michel Barnier, just last week.

“It is a long road, everyone knows that,” he told reporters. “I am not the first to take a long road.”

France’s festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term until 2027.

It has also lifted French borrowing costs and left a power vacuum in the heart of Europe, just as Donald Trump heads to the White House and Germany braces for new elections following the collapse of its governing coalition.

### Sri Lanka says Adani Port Project to continue despite US charges

Indian conglomerate Adani Group’s port project in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite US charges against its founder and sudden changes to its financing, the island nation said Friday.

A bombshell indictment in New York last month accused billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani and several colleagues of deliberately misleading international investors as part of a bribery scheme.

The charges sent Adani stocks into freefall and again raised questions over corporate governance at the family firm, whose founder is considered a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But Sri Lankan ports minister Bimal Ratnayake said the allegations against Adani had no bearing on the deep-sea container terminal project in the capital Colombo.

“The problem between Adani and the US... is not our concern,” he told reporters during a tour of the port on Thursday night.

“It is of high importance for us that western container terminal development by Adani goes ahead.”
