He gave some much-needed impetus in both innings, scoring 44 off 68 in the first and an unbeaten 66 in the second that took the game away from India.",

    "His all-round showing fetched him the Player of the Series. Despite the stellar showing, Ashwin did not find a place in India\u2019s XI for the WTC23 Final against the same opponent but made a mark on his comeback into the Test team with 12 wickets (5/60 and 7/71) in the first game against West Indies followed by fifty and three wickets in the next game.",
    "Adding left-arm variety to the pace attack of the Team of the Year is Mitchell Starc, who secured an impressive 38 wickets in nine matches during 2023.",

    "After a five-for against Ireland, Broad showcased his prowess against Australia yet again and was the highest-wicket taker for England (22 wickets)",
    "The conclusion of Broad\u2019s career was nothing short of a fairytale, as he played a pivotal role in England\u2019s thrilling series draw against Australia.",
    "He capped off by picking up the final wicket, securing the win for England in a closely contested match and providing a fitting end to his remarkable cricketing career."
