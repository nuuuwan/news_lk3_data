  "original_body_lines": [
    "Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Russians that peace with Ukraine will only take place \u201cwhen we achieve our objectives\u201d.",
    "He is holding his first major news conference since he launched his first full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
    "Mr Putin has combined his annual \u201cdirect line\u201d phone-in with Russians with an audience of journalists.",
    "Much of the first part of this marathon event has been focused on what Mr Putin calls the \u201cspecial military operation in Ukraine\u201d.",
    "His initial thoughts addressed the importance of Russian sovereignty. \u201cThe existence of our country without sovereignty is impossible. It will simply not exist,\u201d he told state-controlled Channel One host Yekaterina Berezovskaya.",
    "Mr Putin said Russia\u2019s economy was strong for a time of war and the topic of conversation quickly moved to Ukraine.",
    "Mr Putin said that \u201cthere will be peace [in Ukraine] when we achieve our objectives\u201d. Those \u201cobjectives do not change\u201d, he said, listing \u201cdenazification, demilitarisation and its neutral status\u201d. These are themes he has highlighted from the start of the war.",
    "At one point he revealed that Russia currently has a total of 617,000 troops fighting in Ukraine. He also claimed that on top of 300,000 people called up for service last year, another 486,000 have signed up voluntarily as contract soldiers.",
    "\u201cThe stream of our men who are ready to defend the interests of the homeland with weapons in their hands is not diminishing,\u201d he said. \u201cAltogether there will be just under half a million men by the end of this year. Why do we need a mobilisation?\u201d",
    "He gave no number of military losses, but disclosed that children of people within his \u201cclose\u201d circle have fought for so-called private military companies, and a number of people \u201cclose to me\u201d have died.",
    "A classified US intelligence report estimated this week that 315,000 Russian soldiers had been either killed or wounded since the war began - which it said was almost 90% of Russia\u2019s military personnel at the start of the invasion.",
    "A war reporter for Russian daily Izvestia based in occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine then asked Mr Putin about Ukraine\u2019s recent foothold on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro river.",
    "Describing Ukraine\u2019s military success in a \u201csmall area\u201d as a last-ditch attempt by Ukraine to break through to Crimea, President Putin explained that Russian forces decided to withdraw several metres into wooded areas \u201cto save our lads\u201d. He went on to suggest Kyiv\u2019s main motive is to show the West that it needs more military funding.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know why they are doing it, they are pushing their people to get killed, it\u2019s a one-way trip for Ukrainian forces. The reasons for this are political, because Ukrainian leaders are begging foreign countries for aid.\u201d",
    "While the Russian leader was speaking, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave a press conference at alliance headquarters in Brussels where he warned: \u201cIf Putin wins in Ukraine, there is a real risk that his aggression will not end there.\u201d",
    "Mr Putin went on to claim that Russian forces have the upper hand across the front line in Ukraine.",
    "\u201cPractically along the entire line of contact our armed forces are improving their situation, to put it modestly,\u201d he said at his marathon news conference.",
    "There has been very little movement on the front line in recent months, but Russia is targeting two eastern towns in the Donetsk region, Mariinka and Avdiivka.",
    "Mr Putin insisted that Russia could \u201cmove forward\u201d despite Western economic sanctions and political isolation stemming from its Ukraine invasion.",
    "Mr Putin also covered Russian relations with the United States and EU.",
    "He described the US as an important country but accused it of imperialism. He urged the US to \u201crespect other people and countries\u201d and said Russia was ready to restore relations once this happened.",
    "New York Times correspondent Valerie Hopkins asked the Russian leader what it would take for Russia to release two American citizens held in Russian jails - the Wall Street Journal\u2019s widely respected correspondent Evan Gershkovich and former marine Paul Whelan.",
    "The US sees both men as wrongfully detained and Mr Gershkovich\u2019s detention was extended on Thursday until 30 January. He was arrested while he was reporting for the newspaper in the city of Yekaterinburg and accused of espionage, which he and his colleagues firmly deny.",
    "\u201cAs regards a possible exchange\u2026 we want to reach an agreement, and that agreement must be mutually acceptable and suit both sides,\u201d Mr Putin responded, pointing out the men were subject to a court order.",
    "\u201cA dialogue on the subject is under way. It\u2019s a difficult dialogue and I won\u2019t go into the details now, but I think on the whole we\u2019re speaking in a language which we both understand. I hope we find a solution.\u201d",
    "Aside from the spontaneous questions put to Mr Putin by Russian and international journalists, a reported two million questions were submitted for the event by ordinary Russians and carefully vetted beforehand."
