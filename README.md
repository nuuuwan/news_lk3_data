யாழ்ப்பாணம் வர்த்தக கைத்தொழில்துறை மன்றத்தின் வெள்ளிவிழாக் கொண்டாட்டம் யாழ்ப்பாணத்தில் உள்ள தனியார் மண்டபத்தில்  சனிக்கிழமை (27) நடைபெற்றது.

இலங்கையின் மொத்த தேசிய உற்பத்திக்கு எமது மாகாணம் 4 சதவீதத்தையே பங்களிப்புச் செய்கின்றது. இதை 10 அல்லது அதைவிடக் கூடியளவு உயர்த்துவதற்குத் தேவையான வளம் எமது மாகாணத்தில் இருக்கின்றது. நாங்கள் எங்கள் வளங்களை முழுமையாகப் பயன்படுத்தவில்லை.

பெறுமதி சேர் உற்பத்திப் பொருட்களாக மாற்றுவது மற்றும் ஏற்றுமதியை மேற்கொள்வது என்ற இரண்டு முறைமைகளின் ஊடாகவும் தேசிய உற்பத்திக்கான எங்களின் பங்களிப்பை பெருமளவு அதிகரித்துக் கொள்ள முடியும்.

Officials warn there is a heightened risk of transmission to humans in areas surrounding the sacred city, where large groups of monkeys and toque macaques roam freely.

Therefore, wildlife authorities have urged the general public to be vigilant and take necessary precautions.

While the disease is believed to be potentially zoonotic—capable of being transmitted from animals to humans—public awareness about the threat remains low, increasing the potential for undetected spread, officials have stated.

The overpopulation of monkeys and toque macaques has long been a persistent and unresolved issue in both Polonnaruwa and Giritale, exacerbating the current situation.

Singapore has called on the United Nations to rein in the rising use of veto powers by the five permanent members of the Security Council and pressed for reforms to make the organisation more inclusive.

Delivering the country’s national statement at the UN General Assembly in New York on Sunday (Sep 28), Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said the veto is being deployed with growing frequency at a time of widening conflicts.

“The increasing, and if I may add, cynical use of vetoes by the P5 must be constrained,” said Dr Balakrishnan, adding that the wider UN membership must reach an agreement on how this veto is exercised in the future.

“Just as the world has changed dramatically in the last 80 years, it is also clear that the UN needs to reform to be fit for purpose for the next stretch,” he said. “We need a more representative and a more inclusive UN that reflects current realities.”

### Harry suggests people trying to sabotage reconciliation with King

The Duke of Sussex has suggested people are trying to sabotage his reconciliation with King Charles, as he described media reports about their recent meeting as “categorically false”.

Prince Harry met his father at Clarence House in London on 10 September, in their first face to face meeting since February 2024.

However, a report in the Sun on Saturday suggested the reunion had been more formal than expected, with the duke reportedly left feeling like he was being treated as an official visitor, rather than family.

In a statement, Prince Harry’s spokesperson said the claims were “pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son”.

The Sun newspaper said Prince Harry had confirmed aspects of its reporting. It said the duke’s office “was given full right of reply yesterday in advance of publication and opted not to give a response to the Sun’s carefully sourced account of the meeting”.
