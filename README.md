### It is difficult to reduce the model

Despite global lubricant price drops, immediate fuel price reductions in Sri Lanka are challenging due to the country's reliance on imported and refined fuel, influenced by international market prices, particularly from Singapore. About 35% of Sri Lanka's fuel demand is met through imports. While the cost of lubricant oil has decreased significantly since last September, affecting overall fuel prices, the situation remains complex.

🟩

The Ministry of Power and Energy has said that despite the decline in lubricant prices in the world market, it is difficult to reduce the prices of fuels in the country immediately.

According to the government -approved purchases, fuel prices should be carried out in Sri Lanka.

The refined fuel is imported according to the Singapore Business Index. Accordingly, the secretary also stated that fuel supply should be supplied in Sri Lanka in accordance with the prices that are determined there.

Sulakshana Jayawardena also said that about 35 per cent of the country's total demand is imported and refined, and that the prices of refined fuel in accordance with world market prices cannot be corrected.

However, Professor Vasantha Attukorala of the Economics University of Peradeniya University said that the price of lubricant oil fell by 27 per cent compared to last September.

He said this during a media briefing held at his party headquarters in Jaffna on Sunday (16).. In this regard, he said ..

In fact, I see this as an attempt to keep the problems of the Tamil people as long -standing problems.

Although they are all tied together in a potato bundle, they are scattered like a rolling in every direction, as Prabhakaran is not in the absence of today.

In this case, where is unity among them. What did you get for many years. Is it possible to control the destruction?Is there any improvement?In the absence of the election, they are talking about that again.

### Sri Lanka to end patrician tax free car permits under IMF deal?

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s car import relaxation will be linked to ending the practice of giving permits to special interest groups like civil servants, according to an International Monetary Fund program.

Sri Lanka has provided an initial plan to remove vehicle imports by May 21 and has pledged to give a detailed one by June 15.

“This finalized plan is tied to removing tax exemptions on imports of motor vehicles granted to specific groups including civil servants to curb any revenue leakages from the lifting of the restrictions,” the IMF program said.

“In order to support the recovery, we will relax restrictions on vehicles used for commercial purposes by June 2024.”

Sri Lanka gives tax slashed vehicles to state workers and completely tax-free vehicles to the elected ruling class.

Wickremesinghe’s track record suggests a pattern of governance that prioritises personal and political survival over genuine public service

In the complex and turbulent political landscape of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe has emerged as a figure of significant controversy. Despite holding the office of Prime Minister six times and now serving as President, his tenure has been marked by a series of strategic manoeuvres that have often sidelined democratic principles and prioritised political expediency over national interest.

Wickremesinghe’s political career is a study in resilience and opportunism, akin to a chameleon that changes its colours to blend with its surroundings. The leader of the United National Party (UNP), the oldest political party in Sri Lanka, he has managed to stay relevant through numerous political storms. However, his methods and motivations raise serious concerns.

The IMF issued a Press Release No. 24/214 on 12 June completing the second review under the Extended Fund Facility for Sri Lanka.

The economy is a system. The way we understand any system might be different. We understand the economy as a system having a cause-and-effect relationship. In such a system, as Buddhism preaches, nothing will happen without necessary conditions. When we look at the IMF second review, economic vulnerabilities just arise not knowing proper causes.

It is widely believed and hoped that AKD will be elected to be our next President. I personally hope he will. Not so much know their agenda and policies but there is no other option.

But like thousands more, I am confused why Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not revealed his platform. Sri Lankans are screaming for a wholesale system change. They expect AKD and his team to deliver.

People are not expecting a change of face, but a change of the political structure that will create proper checks and balances, ensure independence of our criminal justice system, restore the rule of law and more.  With this in mind, here are my questions for AKD and his team
