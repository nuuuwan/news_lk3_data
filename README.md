### Sri Lanka’s financial revival: Creating markets that attract, engage, and prosper

Sri Lanka, emerging from economic upheaval, the nation’s capital markets hold unprecedented promise, not only for financial gains but as a catalyst for national growth, resilience, and global integration. While this potential is clear, challenges like limited liquidity, shallow market structures, and a need for investor trust remain key barriers. To transform Sri Lanka’s capital markets into a vibrant, trusted engine of prosperity, actionable reforms, strategic collaborations, and an investor-focused framework are essential. By looking to the success of regional markets and leveraging trends in sustainable finance and digital transformation, Sri Lanka can lay the groundwork for a financial revival.

### US election outcomes and trade policy changes: What it means for Sri Lanka

Now that the United States (US) election has concluded, what direction will the US’s trade policy be headed? This is one of the burning questions that many of its trading partners are asking in the aftermath of the Presidential election. A costly trade war was the outcome of the tariff hikes in 2018 – under the first term of President Trump – which was followed by retaliatory tariffs from the US’s trade partners. Elected for a second term, he is once again proposing significant tariff increases as trade policy measures.

These potential changes in US tariff policies will have a direct impact on Sri Lanka’s export industries. The US is the top individual export destination of Sri Lanka, accounting for 23.6% of its total exports (Figure 1).

### UN arms embargo on Israel: Dead on arrival

In Khan Younis, thousands of people are fleeing for their lives again – Credit: UNRWA

UNITED NATIONS (IPS): When the United Nations imposes sanctions or penalises a member state – be it the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council – the resolutions are “non-binding” and often remain unimplemented.

But the Security Council resolutions are “binding” – and still openly violated by countries such as North Korea—because all these UN bodies have no means of implementing these resolutions, nor a standing army to forcibly enforce them. But they only carry moral weight.

The Council can also impose its own sanctions, mostly in economic, financial and trade sectors, against violators of its decisions.

And last week there was a move to impose arms sanctions against Israel – and rightly so, judging by the 43,000 plus, mostly Palestinian civilians, killed in Gaza largely with US-supplied weapons since October last year.

### Republicans win majority of US House seats, giving Donald Trump and party control of Govt.

Republicans have won enough seats to control the US House, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on US Government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.

A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.

With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the Federal Government and swiftly implement Trump’s vision for the country.

The incoming President has promised to carry out the country’s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the Federal Government’s most powerful tools and reshape the US economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.
