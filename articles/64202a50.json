    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara has been officially appointed as a National List MP for the party. The announcement confirming his appointment was published in an Extraordinary Gazette issued yesterday.",
    "Madduma Bandara, a seasoned politician, previously entered Parliament via the National List in 2020. He has a long-standing Parliamentary career, having represented the Monaragala district from 1989 to 2020 as a member of the United National Party (UNP) before joining the SJB. The SJB secured five National List seats in the 2024 Parliamentary Election, leaving four more appointments to be finalised. Discussions are currently ongoing to determine the candidates for these seats.",
    "One of the key demands comes from the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), an SJB alliance partner. The TPA has urged the SJB leadership to allocate one of the remaining National List seats to its leader, Mano Ganesan, who failed to secure a seat in the election."
