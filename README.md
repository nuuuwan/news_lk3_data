### Sri Lanka electricity utility seeks 6.8-pct tariff increase

*2025-09-10 11:48:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-electricity-utility-seeks-6-8-pct-tariff-increase-239973/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has sought a 6.8 percent tariff hike, spread uniformly across consumer groups, according to a public consultation document published by the regulator.

The increase is sought mostly on account of higher demand forecast being met by thermal energy, the regulator said.

There were also some work-in-progress and finance costs, including capital repayments and some penalty interest due to renewable energy suppliers.

The CEB has proposed spreading the increase evenly across consumer groups.

Sri Lanka has highly discriminatory pricing, with the regulator and utility picking winners and losers with wide gaps.

Among the worst hit are houses with higher usage (domestic demand does go up in the night peak) and general purpose customers. However, hotels also use power in the night.

Under the current pricing system, cross subsidizing consumers are permitted. (Colombo/Sept10/2025)

President Emmanuel Macron has named close ally Sébastien Lecornu as the new French prime minister, 24 hours after a vote of confidence ousted François Bayrou as head of government.

Lecornu, 39, was among the favourites to take over, and he has spent the past three years as armed forces minister focusing on France’s response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

In a statement the Elysée Palace said Lecornu - the seventh PM in the Macron presidency - had been given the task of consulting political parties with the aim of adopting France’s next budget.

Pushing through a budget as head of a minority government was what brought down Bayrou, with left and far-right opponents condemning Lecornu’s appointment.

Bayrou had visited the president hours earlier to hand in his resignation, paving the way for Sébastien Lecornu to become the fifth prime minister of Macron’s second term as president.
