    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s new anti-corruption legislation was introduced in bad faith just to appease the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an opposition legislator said claiming that the bill lacks provisions on asset recovery and retroactive penalising.",
    "Main opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Tissa Attanayake speaking at an event on Wednesday June 21 said the bill was brought in merely to show the IMF that the government has adhered to their condition on addressing corruption vulnerabilities.",
    "\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t an asset recovery law included in this? Why no retroactive punishment? said Attanayake.",
    "\u201cThis was done just to say \u2018look, we have introduced something against corruption too\u2019,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP proposed that the provisions be included on asset recovery and retroactive penalising of people convicted of corruption.",
    "\u201cWhat I see from this is that both the government and President Ranil Wickremesinghe are protecting the Rajapaksa family,\u201d he added.",
    "The second reading of the draft anti-corruption bill was taken up in parliament on Wednesday. Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said last week that robust anti-corruption legislation will help Sri Lanka rank higher in global transparency and ease-of-doing business indices. He invited all parties to cooperate in passing the proposed anti-corruption bill.",

    "Former SJB parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra who also spoke at the event said there was no point bringing in anti-corruption legislation, which she said lacks teeth, while also establishing a broadcast regulatory commission.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the media that reveals corruption the most. What is the point in passing an anti-corruption act when a broadcast authority act is being brought in parallel to it?\u201d she said.",
    "The SJB and other opposition parties have been strongly critical of Sri Lanka\u2019s proposed broadcast regulatory commission act, which they claim could lead to media suppression. The government, however, defends the proposed \u201cconcept paper\u201d, as they call it, claiming that it in fact revokes the media minister\u2019s authority to arbitrarily pull a license from a broadcaster while also subjecting broadcast media to much-needed regulation.",
