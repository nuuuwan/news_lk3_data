    "Helps entrepreneurs with disabilities to get the exposure they deserve",
    "Cargills launched its Village to Home programme in 2020 to provide vital support to the country\u2019s small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) who were severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and left without market access.",
    "Even though the pandemic is behind us, Cargills has continued the Village to Home programme to empower local entrepreneurs. The 19th Village to Home programme took place on 24th and 25th of June at the Cargills Food City Torrington Square with the participation of 24 SMEs.",
    "Since its inception, the programme has provided over 800 SMEs with a platform to showcase their products to the extensive customer base of Cargills. To address the hardships faced by SMEs, Cargills provides a platform to these entrepreneurs to generate additional income and also extends technical assistance to help them bring their products to market. Furthermore, the Cargills Bank extends crucial financial support to these entrepreneurs, enabling them to expand their production capacity.",
    "Cargills provides these monthly trade stalls free of charge, bearing all expenses associated with the programme. Importantly, the entrepreneurs retain all the income earned through the programme, ensuring a direct benefit to their business.",
    "As an extension of the programme, selected SMEs are also provided with dedicated gondolas or base inside Cargills retail outlets for their products. This opportunity allows them to reach and even wider customer base and drive further growth for their business. A notable feature at the Cargills Village to home programme was the exposure it had provided to several entrepreneurs with special needs who are courageous enough to look at the bright side of life and support their own lives through self-employment.",
    "The stalls by Cocoon Foundation for social reintegration of handicapped, marginalized individuals and E.A.S.E Foundation dedicated to educating and supporting both people with disabilities, their families and society, were visited by many kind-hearted clientele of Cargills. Apparently, they didn\u2019t want these disabled entrepreneurs to be isolated and left with little hope. They purchased products at these stalls and encouraged the disabled SME community to face their future with renewed hope.",
    "Dinen Oshitha from E.A.S.E Foundation, a 33-year-old immobile entrepreneur in Hokandara had been brought to the event by his parents. Despite his immobility he had great hopes for his selling cactus arrangements to hotels, wedding receptions, meeting venues and to compassionate buyers. He said that he started with a small capital investment with the support of his parents. He had learned about the business on the internet during the pandemic period and chosen it as a viable means of livelihood.",
    "\u201cWhen my parents are no more there to help me through the challenges of my life, I want to be able to take care of myself and my financial obligations. I love my small business as it keeps me passionately engaged in a worthwhile pursuit, and more so, it\u2019s my journey of being self-reliant when my parents are no more there.",
    "My only dream is to be able to live my life without being a discomfort to anyone. I must prepare myself for that unpredictable future. At present, I earn about Rs. 30,000-35,000 in a good month for business, but it depends on the orders I get. I am intent on expanding my cactus d\u00e9cor products and improving my business,\u201d Dinen said.",
    "Interested individuals can contact Dinen\u2019s mother on 0766619061 to place an order for his products. Other disabled and autistic young adults also showcased their products at the event which included food products, handicraft, soap, greeting cards, decorative sewing etc.",
    "Alongside that, Cargills Village to Home 19th programme witnessed a diverse range of products, offering a vibrant shopping experience to customers. It was encouraging to see them exploring and supporting local entrepreneurs while appreciating the fine-quality of goods.",
