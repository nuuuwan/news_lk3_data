### Forward March By NPP For Social Transformation (Parivarthanaya) – Part II

The parliamentary election on 14th November 2024 was to be like no other in Sri Lanka’s post independent history. Like the Presidential election held on September 21st, it was another ground-breaking expression of people’s will to change the government at a peaceful election. In particular, the result will empower the disempowered and marginalised people from lower socio-economic classes and those from rural and urban fringes who have been misled by previous rulers either by offering temporary inducements while enjoying the aura of power or spreading fear about the different other-generally ethnic minorities- and expensive media campaigns.

Activist and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka’s (BASL) Former President Saliya Pieris PC yesterday hailed the historic victory of National People’s Power (NPP) at Thursday’s Parliamentary Election and stressed the importance of living up to the trust of people.

In a post on Facebook, Pieris said this is the first time one party got two-thirds majority in the Parliament under the proportional representation system if the National People’s Force gets two-thirds majority. Common Front in 2010 and Sri Lanka Podujana Front in 2020 were slightly reduced to two-thirds and had to seek support from some Opposition Ministers to get a two-thirds majority.

The only parallel to this victory is the Presidential Election where the 1994 Prime Minister Chandrika Kumarathunga was appointed as the president.

“The National People’s Force has achieved significant achievements in the North and Eastern regions so that the President can become a leader who can unite various communities in Sri Lanka.

Will Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the top leadership grasp the true significance of their achievement?

Considering the recent past alone, the Parliamentary results clearly build on a process of politicisation that was catalysed by the crisis and the Aragalaya. People are talking everywhere, and they are enthusiastic despite the enduring pressures of crisis and austerity on their households. But we need to remind ourselves that this moment represents a movement with a long genealogy, and not only a charismatic individual. It is now up to a wide set of progressive forces extending beyond the immediate NPP coalition to capitalise on the energy of the electoral victory and channel it in the appropriate direction

For the first time since the enactment of the 1978 Constitution and the advent of the system of proportional representation, the Sri Lankan people have united to confer a two-third majority of its legislative power to a single party, Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s National People’s Power. It also marks the first time that Sri Lankans of all ethnicities across the country all spoke with a single voice, and placed their faith in a single leader.

In one fell swoop, Sri Lanka made clear that it has had enough of race baiting, nepotism, class warfare, corruption, cronyism, political vendettas and rank incompetence.

They saw in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake a leader who they could trust, who sincerely cared for them, who would work hard for them, has no interest in political theatrics and amassing power for himself.

The people could be no clearer – their patience for drama and pettiness has clearly run out.

The mandate is clear: Sri Lankans want to see a Government that works for them, not against them —a Government that acts in the national interest and upholds the rights and dignity of every citizen. A truly systemic change to fulfil the promise of a “Change and Corruption-Free” Sri Lanka.

The illusion of civility and humanity in celebrating independence faded as local elites implemented the colonial project of nation-building on the island, primarily through distorting religion, history, archaeology, and national symbols. This approach solidified racist communalism as a means to deny and suppress demands for equal rights and freedom for all. Beneath this façade lies a subtler exclusion: the romanticisation of the nation as ‘mother’ or ‘motherland,’ idealising gendered traits like care, sacrifice, nurturance, and emotional support
