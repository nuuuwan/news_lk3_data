### Bangladesh crimes tribunal issues arrest warrant for exiled former prime minister

Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, citing her alleged involvement in mass killings during violent protests that erupted earlier this year.

The protests, which began as a student-led movement against public sector job quotas, escalated into some of the deadliest unrest since the country’s independence in 1971, resulting in over 700 deaths and numerous injuries.

The violence ultimately forced Hasina to flee to India on Aug. 5 and an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge.

The tribunal’s proceedings, presided over by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar, saw prosecutors request arrest warrants for 50 individuals, including Hasina.

“I appealed to the court that if the accused, who are extremely influential, are not arrested, it will be impossible to conduct the investigation,” chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said.

### Controversy erupts over Sri Lanka’s CEB move to continue fuel purchases sans tender

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s new government has come under fire over a reported move state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to continue to purchase fuel without competitive bidding, and with a deal struck with Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror newspaper reported that CEB has decided not to go ahead with competitive procurement of fuel but to strike a deal with Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, reversing decision by the earlier administration to move for open tendering.

The report said the CEB had decided not to go for competitive bidding since there was no substantial price variation among different suppliers, the report said.

The last government towards the end of its term had decided to call for bids from different fuel suppliers such as the CPC, LIOC and Sinopec for fuel supply, after multiple fuel distributors were established.

A senior CEB official said the state-run utility provider will issue a clarification on Friday without elaborating.

### CEB criticized for ‘delaying’ electricity tariff revision

The Petroleum Trade Unions have criticized the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for failing to implement the revision of electricity tariffs, which was supposed to take place on October 01, allegedly due to the irresponsible actions of the CEB.

During a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (16), the convener of the union, Ananda Palitha, expressed concerns over the issue.

“The Electricity Board has not yet provided the necessary data to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for the revision of the electricity tariffs. Currently, the CEB’s net profit exceeds Rs. 155 billion. Why is there room for further exploitation?” he questioned.

Further, he urged the President to intervene, stating, “If you are committed to the welfare of the people, you should question the CEB on what it has been doing all this time. Immediate action can be taken to revise the electricity bill, potentially reducing it by at least 45 percent.”

### Italy makes it illegal to seek surrogacy abroad

Italy’s parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime Minister’s Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners.

Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents.

The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year.

The legislation extends a surrogacy ban already in place in Italy since 2004 to those who go to countries such as the United States or Canada, where it is legal, imposing jail terms of up to two years and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.09 million).
