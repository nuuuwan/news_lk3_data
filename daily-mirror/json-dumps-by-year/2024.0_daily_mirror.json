Gaza The Red Sea crisis which is having a great impact on international trade is unlikely to end anytime soon despite the USled naval and air forces hitting Houthi targets in Yemen Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza And that appears to be a far cry Neither the Israelis nor Hamas is willing to give in Israel will not stop its brutal offensive until Hamas releases the 100 hostages it still holds and Hamas will not release them so long as there is no ceasefire in Gaza President Ranil Wickremesinghe has talked of finding alternatives to the Suez CanalRed Sea route for international trade Indeed for reasons unrelated to the GazaRed Sea conflict China has been exploring the prospect of a land route to Europe via Central Asia through its Belt and Road Initiative BRI India is also exploring a MumbaiIranCentral Asia searoadrail link Compared to the land link seaway is the least expensive Land routes may also have to negotiate disturbed areas pointed out Rohan Maskarola CEO of the Shippers Academy in Colombo Sea transport is cheaper than land transport for a number of reasons The main reason for this is that shipping routes need no infrastructure to be maintained as in the case of roads and railway Then there is the economy of scale Container ships can handle large quantities of cargo The largest container ship today can carry around 18000 TEUs in total which means it has space for up to 18000 20foot containers Sea transport is safer because ships are much bigger than trucks or trains and are built for safety The large size of ships also means that they are less likely to tip over There is more room for manoeuvring in the open sea than on roads or tracks Statistically major accidents at sea are much rarer than accidents involving land vehicles If freight cost is a major factor and sea routes are available sea transport will often be the best choice However given that ships are now avoiding the Suez Canal and the Red Sea and going round the Cape of Good Hope South Africa shipping costs have shot up and there are delays hampering world trade Consumers are hit Cost of Rerouting Container News quoting Niels Rasmussen Chief Shipping Analyst at Baltic and International Maritime Council BIMCO one of the largest international shipping associations representing ship owners says that in the first seven weeks of 2024 cargo volumes to and from ports in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea declined 21 percent year on year The number of ships arriving in these ports significantly declined as merchant shipping increasingly avoided transiting through the region Rasmussen said Since November 2023 Houthi forces have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden In February the number of ships transiting through the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal was 50 percent and 37 percent lower than last year Container ship transits were down by 70 percent through the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal Prior to the attacks shipments through the Suez Canal accounted for roughly 10 percent of global trade and in normal times at any given point of time about 400 ships would be passing this waterway Even where alternative export routes exist these often come at a higher cost longer duration and with constraints to capacity Rasmussen added According to EconomyNext freight rates to some European ports from Colombo port have increased by as much as 2000 to 3000 US Dollars per 20foot container which has resulted in doubling of freight costs in some cases As ships are strung along around Africa it will take longer for them to turn around and return to East Asia reducing ship calls and also containers which will remain at sea for longer Going around Africa has increased the time to three weeks when the return journey is counted Both the supply of containers and availability of ships have reduced affecting Eastern routes as well Masakorala said Timothy George who is involved in freight forwarding wrote in his Linked in post that Sri Lanka relies heavily on the Red Sea route for the import of essential goods raw materials and energy resources as well as the export of its products to the European markets Any disturbance in these routes can lead to delays increased shipping costs and supply chain uncertainties for Sri Lanka Disruptions in the Red Sea could result in increased costs for oil imports potentially leading to higher energy prices domestically and impacting various sectors of the economy George added The answer lies not in searching for a land route but in making sincere and collective efforts to end the Gaza war and the Red Sea conflict But efforts in this direction have been disappointing to say the least American Secretary of State Antony Blinkens incessant shuttle diplomacy has neither led to the release of the Israeli hostages nor to the end of Israeli ground and air operations Meanwhile food and essentials for the trapped civilians in Gaza are blocked President Joe Biden having failed to restrain his ally Benjamin Netanyahu or make him stop the carnage in Gaza could only airdrop some food and other relief material on Gaza But as the New York Times pointed out airdropping supplies will not serve the purpose as there is no organisation on the ground to collect and distribute the parachuted supplies There will be chaos Limitations of US operations A USled coalition launched military operations against the Houthis But according to Rasmussen it is going to be a long haul for the USled forces as they are ranged against the Houthis whose armoury of missiles seems to be huge thanks to Iranian backing The official aim of the US antiHouthi operation is to secure safe passage for the commercial ships But experts consider this to be too vague according to Al Jazeera Admirals want politicians to give them precise tasks and clear mandates to achieve the desired results the news website added The Americans have shot down many Houthi missiles and have hit their bases in Yemen but still the Houthi threat remains high as their arsenal is substantial In theory attacks against Houthi missile infrastructure in Yemen could be based on satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV reconnaissance and carried out by missiles launched from the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and armed drones from distant land bases But attacks against targets in Yemen would also carry a clear political risk Al Jazeera points out The US would alienate the Arab and Islamic world as the Houthis have linked their war to the struggle of the people of Gaza who have widespread global support including in the US and Europe"

democratic rule faces a significant test with an estimated 4 billion people in over 60 nations heading to the polling booths to elect their leaders The outcomes of many of these elections are expected to have a global impact as almost half of the worlds population participate in national elections Bangladesh kicked off the year with Sheikh Hasina securing a fourth consecutive term followed by Pakistan The results of these elections are likely to shape global politics for years or even decades to come In 2024 Indonesia is poised to elect a new President in one of the worlds largest

Narendra Modi leading in the polls Mexico is set to hold its Presidential election on June 2 potentially marking a historic moment as there is a possibility that Claudia Sheinbaum a former mayor of Mexico City could become the first woman to govern Mexico according to Mexican pollster Patricio Morelos The European Union representing a population of over 500 million people is scheduled to conduct Parliamentary elections in June Current polls indicate resurgence in support for rightwing populist parties in several member countries including France Germany and Italy In Britain elections are set to take place before the end of the year and polling suggests that Keir Starmer the leader of the opposition Labour Party is on track to potentially conclude a tumultuous 14 years of Conservative rule On November 5 the United States is poised to conduct a highly anticipated Presidential election providing Americans with the choice of either granting Democrat Joe Biden a second term as US President or electing a Republican alternative with Donald Trump appearing as the most likely opponent However the potential Republican challenger faces numerous legal hurdles leading up to the vote Insecurity is anticipated to play a significant role in these elections In the West there is a heightened sense of insecurity encompassing both economic concerns and security issues The ongoing war in Ukraine and uncertainties surrounding the Taiwanese election later this month contribute to the overall unease Executive Presidency and the 50 Fallacy The opportunity to discard the Executive Presidency is not merely a chance for change but a responsibility to safeguard the democratic values that form the foundation of our society It is an investment in a future where governance is characterized by accountability inclusivity and the continuous pursuit of the common good To neglect this momentous opportunity is to accept the perpetuation of a system that may impede progress hinder democratic ideals and saddle future generations with avoidable challenges In the upcoming Presidential Elections or alternatively a preceding Parliamentary Election which is another possibility a notable departure from previous patterns is evident There is a potential scenario where no candidate may secure 50 of the total votes cast a deviation attributed to the presence of more than two major parties competing in 2024 Various politicians across different political spectrums have voiced concerns about the potential outcome foreseeing a situation where no candidate reaches the required fifty percent threshold However this apprehension is a halftruth While a threecornered contest is a distinct possibility the notion that no candidate can be elected is a fallacy The prevailing myth suggests that a candidate must secure 50 of the total votes plus one to be declared the winner A senior politician delved into the process suggesting that if each of the three main parties fielded a candidate none would be able to meet the minimum requirement resulting in a stalemate and rendering the country unable to elect a President Examining the relevant legal framework the Presidential Elections Act No 15 of 1981 and its amendment the Presidential Elections Amendment Act No 16 of 1988 it becomes clear that the Act does not specifically address the counting and declaration of a winner However Part IV of the Act titled The Count encompasses Sections 56 57 58 59 and 60 which when considered together provide essential provisions for the counting process of Presidential elections In essence these sections outline the procedures and criteria for determining the victor at the election They lay out a clear process for determining the winner when no candidate receives an absolute majority more than 50 of valid votes In the case of three candidates the Commissioner of Elections follows a specific procedure The opportunity to discard the Executive Presidency is a chance for change To neglect this momentous opportunity is to accept the perpetuation of the prevailing system that may saddle future generations with avoidable challenges The Commissioner checks if any candidate has received more than 50 of valid votes If so that candidate is declared elected If no candidate achieves an absolute majority the process continues The last candidate is eliminated and the secondthird preferences of the eliminated candidate are counted as votes in favour of the remaining two candidates In cases with more than three candidates the remaining two candidates proceed after eliminating the rest The second preferences of the eliminated candidates are then counted in favour of the remaining two Preference Counting If the second preference is not counted the third preference for one of the remaining two candidates is counted as a vote in favour of the chosen candidate The returning officer prepares a fresh statement indicating the number of second preferences and third preferences specified in favour of the remaining two candidates This process ensures a systematic and fair determination of the winner in the event of a threecornered contest without any candidate obtaining an absolute majority Section 61 of the Presidential Elections Act No 15 of 1981 details the process for determining the winner in a Presidential Election with more than two candidates After eliminating candidates and counting preferences the Commissioner receives statements indicating the number of preferences in favour of the remaining two candidates The Commissioner then ascertains which of the remaining two candidates has received the majority of the votes so counted The candidate who has obtained the majority of the counted votes is forthwith declared elected to the office of President This section emphasizes determining the winner based on the majority of the counted votes without specifying a required percentage Therefore a candidate can be elected as President with a percentage lower than 50 as long as they receive the majority of the counted votes in the described preference counting process In a hypothetical scenario with numerous candidates who share popularity almost equally a candidate could potentially become the Executive President of Sri Lanka with as little as 2 to 3 percent of the valid votes There is no specified minimum cutoff point or required percentage for a candidate to secure victory in the Presidential Election The determining factor lies in receiving the majority of the counted votes through the preference counting process outlined in Section 61 of the Presidential Elections Act No 15 of 1981 kksperera1gmailcom"

headlines for highest number of jumbo deaths As of February 2024 Sri Lanka lost another 38 elephants as a result of the HumanElephant Conflict HEC elephanttrain collisions gunshot injuries and other natural causes In 2023 Sri Lanka made headlines as the country with the highest number of elephant deaths as 473 elephants succumbed to natural and largely unnatural causes For years Sri Lankas wildlife has been at the receiving end of poor infrastructure development encroachment of lands and lack of collaboration among stakeholder institutions to minimize humanwildlife conflicts It is in this backdrop that the Ministry of Transport and Highways with the Sri Lanka Railways Department and the Protect Sri Lanka Organisation tied up to initiate the construction of Sri Lankas first wildlife underpass in Kasikote Galgamuwa on March 1 A historic moment The project bore fruition as a result of a collaborative effort led by Convener of Protect Sri Lanka Movement Ven Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera To mark the occasion a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Galgamuwa recently Minister of Transport Highways and Mass Media Dr Bandula Gunawardena and several other dignitaries graced the occasion This is a historic moment for everyone Wildlife and humans are interlinked and when one group dominates another it gives rise to conflicts This is quite a progressive decision made by the transport minister and his officials Most villagers questioned what would happen after the tunnel is built Nobody can stop elephants using this route They will travel along this route ignoring the hurdles The wildlife underpass is a meritorious deed as it would help save many elephants Already around five elephants met their fate at this location due to elephanttrain collisions When the concern was raised with the Transport Ministry Secretary and the Minister himself they responded promptly The Getadiwula forest reserve Every week either one or two humans are killed due to HEC But is there an elephant crisis in this country Villagers have a concern as to whether these elephants would be a threat to them But elephants dominated land ever since the prehistoric era much before humans came to this planet This is their homeland People have constructed houses along elephant corridors and as a result HEC occurred Humans and elephants need to coexist Over 50 percent of travellers to Sri Lanka love watching elephants It is these dollars that bring the much needed foreign exchange and keep the economy going If elephants become extinct tourism figures will drop Elephants are a treasure So if area residents have an issue lets try to sort it out together If around 100150 elephants use this migratory route it means that every person in this village can become a tour guide In countries such as India villagers provide a tree hut experience for tourists to allow them to observe elephant behaviours This is how they earn dollars The land opposite the railway track is a forest patch spanning around 950 acres But the teak trees have been replaced by a plant called Kaaya If this forest patch can be made elephantfriendly with an abundance of food and water while surrounding it with an elephant fence this area can be promoted as a hotspot for wildlife tourism This is one way in which humans and elephants can coexist he added A note of appreciation R M J Bandara a resident from Galgamuwa had been at the forefront championing efforts to minimize the HEC in the village and surrounding areas He utilizes social media as an effective mode of communication updating users on events related to elephants daily Speaking at the event Bandara said that the Getadiwula forest reserve located opposite the railway track is maintained by the Forest Department Around 100150 elephants move via this forest reserve every day They begin their journey from Yakdessawa and move towards Kasikote during the day and return to their habitats later in the evening There are some of us who stop vehicles to allow elephants to cross the road But there is no way that a train could stop to allow the elephants to pass Some residents fear that this route would eventually become an elephant corridor But this effort is to minimize elephanttrain collisions in the location I suggest that a mechanism should be in place to protect residents living in close proximity to the railway line and paddy lands of farmers that these elephants often frequent There are other migratory routes for these elephants all the way up to Thabbowa and Wilpattu Elephants in the KahallaPallekele Forest Reserve and even in Kala Wewa also use this route Due to commercialization in surrounding areas the density of elephants in Galgamuwa has increased by manifold As resident of the area I appreciate this effort added SLRs conservation efforts Addressing the gathering Sri Lanka Railways General Manager Eng H M K W Bandara said that renovations along the MahoAnuradhapura railway track are currently underway Similarly to this project we plan to identify other locations where elephants frequent in order to construct culverts and underpasses We also plan to identify locations to construct culverts and tunnels The speed at which trains would move via the Maho to Anuradhapura route is 100kmph but we plan to identify elephant migratory routes along this railway line and reduce speed limits to 20kmph at these specific locations The railway track will be constructed in such a way that it would be easier for elephants to pass via these migratory routes Plans are underway to install high capacity engine lights to make it easier for the drivers to see elephants during evening hours Luminous signboards will be set up in places where elephants frequent In addition studies are underway to implement an elephant detection system to minimize elephanttrain collisions Different kinds of elephant fences put up to keep elephants away Looming jumbo threats Despite a heat advisory issued by the Meteorological Department Manjula Udayakumara was busy at work at his paddy land We were in Yakdessawa an area frequented by elephants in the heart of Galgamuwa Udayakumara is one paddy farmer who has gone the extra mile to protect his harvest from elephants He recalled how an elephant had once broken into his paddy storage throwing him off his bed and since then elephants have become a burden to his family I have stored paddy to suffice an entire year I have to feed my family But it is an added burden to keep the elephants away Therefore I have protected the windows with a mesh of nails and sometimes I have passed the current so that elephants wont dare to come near my house He showed us around his house where he stores firecrackers and other equipment to chase elephants away When asked about the new wildlife underpass to be built in Galgamuwa Udayakumara said that it is not practical to construct underpasses assuming that the elephants would utilize that route How can these people be sure that elephants would move along this particular route he questioned As a result more elephants will now move into villages aggravating the conflict I invite these decisionmakers to spend one day at our houses and see what we are going through H M Cyril Seneviratne President Yakdessawa Farmer Organisation echoed similar sentiments In another two weeks time elephants will roam around this area even during the day It is not practical to have oneoff solutions for this conflict which has been aggravating for years But I feel that there needs to be a mechanism to protect elephants People need to understand that they have encroached into habitats dominated by wildlife Farmers in Kasikote complained that many have abandoned their paddy lands and houses as a result of the HEC Despite elephant fences and other mechanisms people are afraid to coexist with elephants given their brutal nature A mesh of nails added to protect windows at Udayakumaras house It is difficult to reap harvests as they destroy paddy plants The authorities should look at isolating these giants in one particular area so that they wont harm humans But this is easier said than done We cant think of any solution at this point said M Rajapaksa As dusk set in it was time for us to head back to Colombo But for residents in Galgamuwa it is an indication for them to return to their tree houses and watch over their precious paddy lands as the jumbos start returning to their habitats"

restrictions which had hampered economic growth The new governments first budget was a calculated bid to break away from a cycle of economic stagnation and mounting internal and external debts This massive operation was a great challenge to the governments political skills The budget marked a fundamental shift in Sri Lankas monetary and fiscal perspectives through liberalized economic policies which emphasized greater reliance on the market mechanism a liberalization of trade and payments and a large increase in external finance Most direct controls on prices imports and external payments were dismantled government operations in processing and distribution of basic commodities were reduced if not removed and attractive incentives were provided to producers There was also the

oriented exchange market This policy package was supported by standby arrangements with the International Monetary Fund There were two interesting aspects about Ronnie de Mel the path breaking finance minister who introduced a free or capitalist economy for Sri Lanka Firstly he had been a socialist with left leaning views since his university days Secondly he had never studied economics for his degree Ironic Contradiction Years after he had retired from politics Ronnie de Mel was to speak about this ironic contradiction of a socialist presenting a capitalist budget to a Lake House newspaper It had become fashionable to follow a strictly socialist path back then I believed in the idea that a country could be developed under socialism till I visited the socialist countries back then Thats when I realised we need global support if we are to develop as a country Ronnie de Mel further stated that it was after being personally converted from a socialist perspective to a free economy outlook that he formulated his first budget After many discussions with the then Prime Minister JR Jayewardene Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel came up with a modified concept of an open economy combined with progressive features to support the under privileged I was careful not to touch free education free health concessions for agriculture fisheries and various other sectors he said In another interview given years before the current economic crisis Ronnie De Mel looked back with pride at the change he had accomplished then If not for the free market economy we would still be having scarcities queues and we would be struggling like North Korea today It was because of this change that everything in this country blossomed and developed Ronnie de Mel said He went on to say Today every country including Russia and China is fast embracing the open economy system Education Ronnie de Mel was the son of Rodget and Gladys de Mel nee Mendis He obtained his primary and secondary education at SThomas College Mt Lavinia Young Ronnie passed the London Matriculation exam topping all students in the country then He received a scholarship to one of the OxBridge universities in the UK but his mother forbade it as World War II was raging then If one were to go to England one had to be a passenger on board a British naval vessel Ronnies mother was afraid of the ship being attacked by the German or Japanese forces So Ronnie de Mel entered the newly born University of Ceylon with Sir Ivor Jennings as ViceChancellor in 1942 De Mel studied English Latin Greek and History obtained the best results in campus and graduated with a BA hons degree Ronnie was also president of the university students union Civil Service Ronnie sat for the Ceylon Civil Service CCS exam and joined the CCS in 1948 He served in different capacities at the Puttalam Vavuniya and Matara Kachcheris He also had stints at the Dept of Social Services and the Ministries of Labour and Agriculture and Lands at different times It was as a civil servant that Ronnie de Mel married Mallika Lakshmi Fernando the second daughter of Sir Leo and Lady Irene Fernando Sir Leo Fernando a transport tycoon and landed proprietor was one of the richest men in Sri Lanka known as Ceylon then He also represented the Buttala electorate as a UNP parliamentarian from 1947 to 54 The Kurunduwatte gossip then was that the eligible civil servant had bagged an ample dowry Though a rising star in the Lankan bureaucracy Ronnie was at heart a political animal and yearned to be in active politics After 16 years of being a civil servant Ronnie de Mel quit the administrative service in 1964 and threw his hat in the ring for the 1965 parliamentary hustings Bibile Ronnies first attempt in electoral politics was in the historic Wellassa region of the Uva province He contested the Bibile seat in Moneragala district in March 1965 Though Bibile was a predominantly Kandyan Sinhala seat it is surmised that Ronnie opted for it due to the commercial interests of his late fatherinlaw there It is said that the then UNP Leader Dudley Senanayake had stated so publicly during the election campaign Initially De Mel had tried for UNP nomination but the UNP opted for Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Dharmadasa Banda RM Dharmadasa Banda who was the younger brother of former Bibile MP Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Gunasekera RM Gunasekera RM Gunasekera had been shot dead by an unknown assassin in 1964 The UNP felt it had to give the candidacy to a family member This had resulted in younger brother Dharmadasa Banda stepping in as UNP candidate at the young age of 27 The sympathy wave over the elder brothers murder enabled the younger brother to defeat ex CCS candidate Ronnie de Mel by 1657 votes Banda got 8644 to de Mels 6907 Dharmadasa Banda later became a minister in UNP and SLFP Govts Incidentally Moneragala district MP and SJB Gen Secy Ranjith Madduma Bandara is RM Gunasekaras son Devinuwara The SLFP led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike was in the Opposition from 1965 to 1970 The UNP Govt of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was in power In July 1960 PP Wickremasuriya had won the Devinuwara seat on the SLFP ticket Subsequently he crossed over in Dec 1964 with CP de Silva In the 1965 elections Wickremasuriya contested as the candidate of the Sri Lanka Freedom Socialist Party SLFSP led by CP de Silva which had an electoral alliance with the UNP Veteran leftist politico PH William de Silva contested on the SLFP ticket and won Devinuwara in 1965 However he was unseated on an election petition A by election was scheduled PP Wickremasuriya was going to be the UNP candidate Mrs Bandaranaike regarded Wickremasuriya as a renegade and traitor She wanted him defeated and looked out for a winning candidate DM Rajapaksas son and Mulkirigala MP George Rajapaksa recommended Ronnie de Mel Mrs Bandaranaike agreed somewhat reluctantly Ronnie De Mel had absolutely no links to the Devinuwara electorate and was a rank outsider The UNP campaign harped on the fact that Ronnie was a parachutist The SLFP campaign was spearheaded by George Rajapaksa He was assisted by the then Mirigama MP Siva Obeyesekere The by election was held on 15 March 1967It was a straight fight between De Mel and Wickremasuriya De Mel polled 18483 votes while PP Wickremasuriya polled 16015 votes De Mel won with a 2438 majority Speeches The new Devinuwara MP with his leftist ideology and classical oratory was an instant hit His parliamentary speeches were very popular So too were his public speeches This writer first heard Ronnie speak when he was 15 years old The Colombo University students were on strike then and organized a parallel varsity outside the campus One of my cousins an undergrad took me along for a lecture by Ronnie de Mel who spoke on how to evolve a social economy in Sri Lanka then Ceylon It was well received and impacted me greatly Years later as a journalist on the Virakesari I mentioned this to Ronnie in conversation He grinned and replied that he had come a long way since then Incidentally Ronnie De Mel was well disposed towards the Virakesari This was due to the Virakesari providing much publicity to him when in the Opposition Though Tamil votes were unnecessary for his politics Ronnie appreciated the papers coverage Besides the then Virakesari Editor and Managing Director interacted closely with Ronnie in those days No Cabinet Post The 1970 elections saw the United Front comprising the SLFP 91 LSSP 16 and CP 06 win 116 seats in a landslide The SLFPs Ronnie De Mel beat the UNPs PP Wickremasuriya with a majority of 6051 Ronnie got 20798 to PPWs 14747 Everyone expected the Devinuwara whiz kid to get a plum cabinet post But shockingly Ronnie was overlooked or ignored Not even a junior minister post Several reasons were attributed for the shabby treatment meted out to De Mel One was that in a Govigama dominated Govt the Karawe quota had been filled by the LSSPs Leslie Goonewardene Another reason given by a family friend of George Rajapaksa was that Mrs Bandaranaike and her loyalists were worried about Ronnies affinity with George Rajapaksa The Bandaranaikes were allegedly paranoid about a potential political threat from the Rajapaksas and therefore Ronnie suspected of being in the Rajapaksa camp was put in his place in a preemptive strike According to some SLFP old timers there was another possible vindictive reason for Ronnie being sidelined Apparently when Ronnie was working at the Puttalam Kachcheri he had penalised a close relative of the Balangoda Ratwattes for alleged corruption This allegedly angered Sirimavo who nursed a grudge against De Mel and had taken revenge after many years This writer contacted a respected senior journalist very knowledgeable in political matters about De Mels exclusion from the 1970 cabinet The response was as follows My guess is that Ronnie did not get a ministry in 1970 due to the presence of superior talentseniorityreputation in the left constituents of the UF as well as the need to accommodate senior SLFPers Ronnie wouldnt have been satisfied with a deputy ministry I know Ronnie made a pitch for the fisheries ministry on account of caste He probably judged JRJ as the coming colour in 1977 and made the strategic shift Independent MP Whatever the reason the reality was that of De Mel being given the cold shoulder in 1970 A disappointed and disgruntled De Mel quit the Govt in 1973 and went across to the Opposition Instead of joining the UNP Ronnie functioned as an Independent MP When JR Jayewardene resigned his seat and contested the Colombo South by election Ronnie supported JR who won with a 25801 majority After a while JR invited De Mel to join the UNP and Ronnie accepted Ronnie contested Devinuwara again in July 1977 but this time on the UNP ticket In a reversal of roles his rival was now from the SLFP Ronnie polling 23776 got a 9439 majority The SLFP candidate Dickson Silva obtained 14 337 The UNP won 141 out of 168 seats in Parliament Ronnie was appointed Finance Minister and went on to serve as FM for 11 years This was his tryst with destiny As stated earlier the JRRonnie duo transformed the Sri Lankan economy Duel with Upali An article about Ronnie de Mel would not be complete without mentioning his duel with Upali Wijewardene Being a reporter at The Island during the eighties of the last century provided an amusing insight into that tussle Apparently relations between Ronnie and Upali were amicable until the latter evinced interest in entering politics Ronnie felt Upali was eying the finance ministry portfolio as a stepping stone to the executive presidency Soon there was no love lost between both When JR appointed Upali as Director General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission GCEC with the responsibility of setting up free trade zones FTZ Ronnie did not like it The finance minister created an alternative structure the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee FIAC and provided incentives like tax holidays to potential investors outside the FTZs Both the GCEC and FIAC competed for foreign investment separately Another bone of contention was the envisaged Ruhuna University Upali wanted it located in Kamburupitiya electorate which he was nursing as his future constituency Ronnie wanted it in Matara De Mel had his way Upali utilised his publications to irritate Ronnie The cartoon paper Chitra Mithra featured a canine character named Ronnie When Kundasale MP RP Wijesiri took up cudgels on behalf of Ronnie and flayed Upali ace cartoonist Wijesoma drew a cartoon showing Wijesiri washing dirty linen in public Events took a serious turn when The Island edited then by Vijitha Yapa scooped details of the Budget on Budget day morning JR was furious The Finance Minister had to alter some of his proposals in a hurry and was seen reading from Xerox copies in Parliament Later Ronnie allegedly motivated the CID into launching a prosecution of Vijitha Yapa under the official secrets act Resigned in 1988 After presenting 11 consecutive budgets de Mel resigned as finance minister in 1988 He did not contest the 1989 elections Ronnie went abroad after Ranasinghe Premadasa became President He returned to Sri Lanka after Premadasas death in 1993 Matara Ronnie de Mel contested the Matara district on the UNP ticket in 1994 and won Later he joined the SLFP and contested Matara on the Peoples Alliance ticket He was reelected as Matara MP In 2001 Ronnie reentered Parliament as a national list MP His wife Mallika de Mel contested Matara on the PA ticket and was elected as MP In their married life spanning over five decades Ronnie and Mallika de Mel have three daughters Sunalini Tara and Renuka Mallika de Mel passed away on 12 October 2009 After leading a quiet life for nearly 15 years after his spouses demise Ronnie de Mel breathed his last on 27 Feb His remains were lying at the de Mel residence in Charles Drive Col 3 till 29 Feb for people to pay their respects The funeral was held on for March 1st at the Ruhuna University grounds in Matara

        "headline": "Has Insensitivity Become The Norm",
        "body": "Ceylon Electricity Board CEB Media spokesman Noel Priyantha resigned from his position after criticisms over his insensitive remarks during an interview with a private TV channel towards the hapless electricity consumers who are struggling to pay their electricity bills When he was told at the interview that a father who had attempted to get electricity from a nearby house to support his childs studies had died by electrocution and was asked why the CEB could not be more considerate of the sufferings of the consumers the Spokesman said that the children can use oil lamps for their studies without depending on electricity In responding to another question about the estate workers he attempted to attribute the poverty of the plantation community to overaddiction to liquor consumption irking the upcountry political party leaders Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman stated in a post on X formerly Twitter that the entire statement by the CEB spokesman lacks empathy and is unacceptable Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara replied I agree with the sentiments of Jeevan Thondaman and many more that had raised the lack of empathy and professionalism in the statement made by the CEB spokesman Despite the CEB having to take no direct responsibility for the electrocution incident they have to accept the moral responsibility for the remote link between the incident and the recent huge surge in electricity tariff which deprived the deceased mans family of electricity And it was the point that the journalist was trying to drive home during the interview that landed the CEB Spokesman in hot water The prevailing economic crisis has resulted in a drastic drop in the revenue of a majority of lowincome families compelling them to struggle to make ends meet as the prices of essential items have gone threefold or sometimes fourfold up since 2022 It was in that context that the CEB had increased electricity tariff twice by what they say 70 percent However the practical effect of these increases on the individual households has been fivefold or more This has compelled over a million households to default the payment of bills resulting in their power supply being disconnected according to a speech by the subject minister Kanchana Wijesekara In a country where there are about 51 households the depriving of one million households of electricity due to unaffordability is a serious matter Asking them why their children cannot study using oil lamps is no doubt a cruel insult In fact many of those households of which the electricity supply has been disconnected would have turned to the traditional oil lamp in a practical sense The irony and the absurdity of the CEB Spokesmans statement is the promotion of oil lamps by a representative of the institution that is tasked to supply power to the people Nevertheless Priyantha must be commended for his outspokenness in this issue Many officials of the Power and Energy Ministry and the CEB too might have shared his sentiments when people agitated against the unprecedented electricity tariff surge But none of them spoke from their heart like Priyantha did or else they did not come across a situation that prompted them to speak on the matter Hence singling out Priyantha seems to be unfair Insensitivity towards fellow human beings is not a monopoly of an individual sector or institution The recent sudden vegetable price hike by sixfold or more cannot be attributed to any increase in production cost obviously it is the result of the heartlessness of middlemen However even those middlemen would have laughed at Priyanthas oil lamp solution Insensitivity among the officials and employees of institutions which are well known to pay relatively higher salaries such as the CEB Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is felt more by the lowincome groups of the society Apart from the recent two drastic tariff hikes the CEB earned a huge profit due to the incessant rainfall in the catchment areas during the last six months of the last year Hence the Power and Energy Ministry and the CEB announced a possible tariff reduction with the advent of the new year However manifesting their insensitivity towards the hapless masses who are hit by the economic crisis they initially suggested only a 3 percent price reduction The absurdity of this suggestion would be vivid when it is applied to an electricity bill of an average family which uses just below 90 units of electricity Such a family paid less than Rs 1000 in 2022 and the cost has increased now up to around Rs 5000 The reduction that was initially proposed was only Rs 150 What an insult Subsequent to agitations by consumer societies and the Opposition political parties now the reduction has been suggested to be 18 percent It is against this backdrop Central Bank has been taken to task by the Opposition parties for the recent 70 percent salary increment to its employees Some higher officials of the bank have been given an increment of over half a million rupees The Central Bank authorities cite the necessity to face the recent trend of brain drain and the fact that the bank is an independent institution as the reasons for the move However parity in salaries with the World Bank and its affiliate institutions the Bank of England the Commonwealth Secretariat and similar institutions which the authorities cite as impacted by the recent brain drain is something Sri Lanka cannot achieve and the threat would continue to remain as it has been in the past Those officers who had left the country recently would have been prompted to do so due to the recent surge in taxes uncertainty of the future and the galloping cost of living which are the effects of the current economic crisis The Central Bank as well as the politicians cannot absolve themselves from the responsibility of ruining the economy The Supreme Court in its recent judgement on the economic crisis had ruled that two former Governors of the Central Bank Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Professor W D Luxman and the former Monetary Board of the Bank were responsible for the crisis along with connected politicians Yet one has to admit that the Bank is faced with a dilemma now Brain drain is a fact and it is threatening the very existence of the Bank whilst as it is also responsible for the economic downturn it has to be accountable to the people when it increases the salaries of its staff Those are issues that have to be taken into consideration by the people as well Two more incidents where the insensitivity towards the people is highly evident were the one where former Health Minister Keheliya Rambuwella commented on the funeral parlours near hospitals and the remarks made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the abolition of Executive Presidency When allegations were levelled against the Health Ministry over people dying and losing eye sight due to substandard medicine and the shortage of medicines Rambukwella told Parliament on July 18 last year that not all patients admitted to hospitals make it out alive and that is why funeral parlours are located near hospitals Literally he was correct but at a time when some patients were believed to have died due to substandard medicines the man who is responsible for health sector justifying that situation is no doubt outrageous Similarly it is outrageous for the man who came to power twice in 2005 and 2010 mainly on the promise to abolish the Executive Presidency to say I enjoyed the Executive Presidency it doesnt matter if they abolish it now Rajapaksa expressed this view on February 15 while addressing the media At the same time the insensitivity evident in the sudden strikes launched by the doctors and other employees of the health sector without prior notice or with short notice leaving the patients to die and suffer more is no less than what was evident in Rambuwellas remarks"

        "body": "Environmental groups warn that the proposed wind power project will destroy Mannars pristine ecosystems Image courtesy Dr Rishani Gunasinghe In February 2023 Adani Green Energy Sri Lanka Ltd was given provisional approval for two wind power projects of 250 MW in Mannar and 234 MW in Pooneryn The proposed project site in Mannar spans across 250 acres of an environmentally sensitive location and environmental groups have expressed their concerns regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment EIA which is open for public comments till March 6 If the project in Mannar gets approved around 50 turbines will be setup along one of the most important migratory bird corridors in the world causing an irreversible ecological damage Destroying a birding paradise It is a known fact that Mannar attracts millions of migratory birds during the year including flamingos For birders the Central Asian Flyway one of the eight global migratory highways is of particular importance as millions of birds fly via this route every year from north to south and vice versa Shedding light on why Mannar shouldnt be used the way it is going to be used for this project Sampath Seneviratne Professor of Zoology at the University of Colombo explained the behaviours of migratory bird species The migratory species breed in the Northern hemisphere migrate to the south remain for six months during winter and fly back The Central Asia Flyway covers Eastern Europe all the way to far Eastern Russia Mannar is in fact one of the main entry points and around a million birds remain there Data from the ebird citizen science platform shows that theres a high density of birds in Mannar The Asian Water Bird Survey shows that from 1937 to now there has been a stable presence of birds in Sri Lanka The data shown have been obtained from one of the most technologically advanced studies conducted by the Colombo University Chinese Academy of Sciences and several other institutions Some bird species tagged from Mannar traverse the Himalayas some 24000 ft in the skies all the way to Tibet lay eggs there and return to Sri Lanka This shows how Sri Lanka connects to the rest of the world and this evidence is based on futuristic sciences Some birds spend 6 months in Pesalai Urumalai Vedithalathive Resident bird species found in Mannar Talaimannar Vankalai and Mannar Town sometimes feeding off fish on fishing vessels Birds from Mannar fly through India Gujarat Pakistan Karachi Afghanistan Uzbekistan to Europe and Arctic breed there and come back via Iran over the Arabic Sea to Mannar They travel some 25000km One of the birds have travelled 70000km over the past 3 years When they go they tell us the humidity temperature places where they stop and we connect with global birders around the world Prof Seneviratne further said that another important area of concern is the Palk Bay which is a large wetland One part is in India and the other end is Sri Lanka and most migratory species spend a lot of time here This is not just another place but a special place on the global map We have been able to generate migratory maps of 22 individual species and Mannar has million more birds A data point is being generated every half an hour indicating the flight of a bird Some of these are globally endangered species while some are in fact the last remaining species on this planet The project site of the proposed wind power project falls through the Adams Bridge Marine National Park Every half an hour theres a data point generates and wherever they go we know day and night globally endangered species some of the last remaining species come here rectangle represent the project site of Adani Green Energy connectivity of wetlands in Mannar Adams Bridge National Park PuthukudirippuErukkalampiddy wetland Vankalai Ramsar Sanctuary and Vedithalathive Nature Reserve he underscored A flawed EIA The Environment Impact Assessment EIA is now open for public comments But legal experts have pointed out several grey areas in this document Senior environmental lawyer Dr Jagath Gunawardene said that usually an EIA is done under three broad laws the National Environment Act NEA Coast conservation and coastal resource management Act and the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance FFPO But in this case the EIA is done under the NEA and the project approving body is the CEA The best way is to have two concurrent authorities the project approving agency and the CEA but like in many other instances the CEA is the sole project approving body We have time till March 6 to express comments in writing and in addition we have asked for an oral submission for the comments we give in writing Written comments have to be given by persons who wish to be heard on the hearing We suggest that people in Mannar and in other parts of the country too are given a chance to submit oral submissions People have the right to protect the environment as per the Constitution and it is applied equally to all citizens He further said that Section 33 of the NEA states that an EIA is necessary for any project and it should have a detailed description of the project environmental impacts of the project and suggestions to reduce the impacts It should also include the prevailing environmental conditions at the project site as well Thirdly and most importantly an EIA should mention other environmentallyless damaging alternatives and those drafting the EIA should indicate why they have discarded the environmentallyless damaging options and have opted for this alternative he added Dr Gunawardana warned that the ultimate decision would be affected if they go by the existing EIA In this report these sections havent been included and therefore it is an incomplete Megha a Heuglin Gull report The project approving authority evaluates the report but they dont do the research Their decisions depend on the quality and quantity of materials in the report But if the report doesnt include the truth havent addressed issues carefully then the ultimate decision will be flawed Some key factors havent been addressed There is no analysis done on palm groves There are three species of critically endangered bats in this area But only one species is mentioned There are over 200 bird species in Mannar but only a few are mentioned in the report Then there are residential species in Mannar and theres no indication of how their habitats would be impacted by the project Then what about the evaluation of alternatives They have mentioned Ambewela as an alternative location but theres no justification as to why they chose Mannar and why other places were not taken into account Theres no logical reasoning This is called Error in the face of reporting because the document itself is poorly documented We expect a better environmentallyfriendly alternative or proposals to minimize the impacts through an EIA But if these arent included theres no point in going forward He further stressed on the suggestion to protect the birds by setting up a corridor We cant advice where the birds can fly So how can we be sure that these birds would fly from this proposed corridor If the birds die they will say that the birds didnt fly via the suggested corridor Therefore a corridor is not a valid solution Dr Gunawardana further said that all migratory species are protected by the law We are part of the Biological Diversity Convention and therefore we are obliged to protect our biological diversity including migrant species Irrespective of whether they are on land or sea we are obliged to protect these species The Central Asian Flyway includes Mannar as well and there are international conventions to protect all migratory animals including the Convention on Migratory Species which has listed many species The crab plover is one such species and they have a migratory route along the Central Asian Flyway Migratory animals are not only birds It includes butterflies and dragonflies as well The report doesnt mention about dragonflies or butterflies at all These are some of the issues in this report The EIA report should be adequate enough for the decision maker to take an informed decision but a report of this nature would lead to a flawed decision From a legal point of view this report has disregarded many key points We are under obligation to abide by international conventions and we cannot recommend a report or project that would undermine the obligations Blindfolding in broad daylight In his analysis on the proposed generation of power narrated by the project owner internationally acclaimed biodiversity scientist Dr Rohan Pethiyagoda said that the proposed wind farm will generate 250 megawatts of power The EIA states that this is a low cost alternative when compared to other traditional power plants in the country But over the years it has been observed that wind prices are at all time lows when compared to gas and solar What we are going to pay Adani is 200 to 300 times more than global wind power prices While global prices come down we are obliged to pay this fixed rate for the next 25 years According to the agreement the Adani Wind Power project will take away an estimated USD 1250 million as foreign revenue from Sri Lanka which in other words mean that we will have to purchase wind power at USD rates when in fact it is a natural resource that we already have"

20242025 WHY is Sri Lanka playing hide and seek WHY would the Department of Probation and Child Care Servicesobject The Children and Young Persons Ordinance Original Act Original CYPO Because CYPO identified the age of a child as 16 years children between the ages of 1618 years who committed offenses are placed in adult prisons lacking appropriate rehabilitation and care These special units are infamously known as kolu waattu where young boys are compelled to offer sexual favours to adult prisoners and are used as drug peddlers Children transport drugs to adult prisoners hidden in their orifices that they receive from external sources who pretend to be their relatives These special units function with the full knowledge of the authorities and are a living hell The care and protection of these children are the responsibility of the Prison Service under the Ministry of Justice The care and protection of children under the age of 16 is the responsibility of the Probation and Child Care Service under the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs When the Amendments to the Act were tabled in Parliament on 17 November 2022 by Minister of Justice Wijayadasa Rajapakse it was done so without the date of implementation amidst objections of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services which insisted they could not take responsibility of children between 1618 years Upon further investigations Stop Child Cruelty Trust SCCT and Sri Lankas first Child Protection Alliance CPA found out there were about 30 children between 1618 years housed in various adult prisons and about 2025 of them could be released these children were languishing in prison because of the lack of legal guardianship lack of money to pay fines or lack of legal representation SCCT and CPA in their letter to the President in June 2023 whilst highlighting the inefficiency in passing the Amendment Act urged the President to ensure that the necessary training and resources are provided to house these children separately under the care and protection of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services SCCT and CPA welcome the amendments which signify a paradigm shift in the treatment of children in conflict of the law The amendments provide the opportunity for children to receive appropriate rehabilitation and care under the supervision of the Provincial Department of Probation and Child Care emphasizing a rehabilitative rather than a punitive approach promoting the global principles of restorative justice a modern holistic method to end violence against children WILL the authorities comply Implementing the Law is Key Sri Lanka does not recognize the child as a rights holder As a result the protection of 25 of its population nearly 52 million children under the age of 18 is a national crisis The needs of the most vulnerable community are firmly ignored by the lethargy of both the law makers and implementers UNICEF in its Press Release of 7 February 2024 reiterates The UNCRC notes that detention of a child should only be a last resort and for the shortest period as evidence shows that institutionalization can hinder a childs development and reintegration perpetuating a cycle of violence and poverty For juvenile offenders UNICEF calls upon stakeholders in the justice probation and child care sectors to prioritize the application of noncustodial measures such as familybased rehabilitation as they are more effective and protective of children The amendment to the CYPO represents a key step towards building a justice system that prioritizes the best interest of the child The implementation of long awaited amendments to CYPO is a huge victory that should have been broadcast on every news channel as a New Year message of hope a dawn of a new era free of violence against children The National Child Protection Authority and Department of Probation and Child Care Services should have embraced the amendments with a firm commitment to protect and promote the rights of all children breaking the institutionalized lethargy The Members of Parliament and representatives of all citizens should have applauded the amendments ensuring that child protection is embedded in the heart of the national security agenda The failure of every authority to recognize the CYPO Amendment Act that came into effect on 1 January 2024 strongly suggests the lack of responsibility and accountability to implement yet another progressive law WILL Sri Lanka ever become a developed country Dr Tush Wickramanayaka is the Chairperson Stop Child Cruelty Trust Coconvener Child Protection Alliance"

        "body": "Displaced Palestinian children gather for food in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip AFP The October 7 2023 attacks the Palestinian resistance group Hama launched on Israel did not happen in a vacuum In October last year weeks after the Hamas attack the United Nations SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres told the UN Security Council that it is important to recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum Intellectuals avoid jumping to conclusions They investigate all sides of an issue including its history context and surrounding narratives to form an opinion grounded in justice The SecretaryGeneral was not taking sides in the IsraelPalestinian question His speech conformed to what was expected of an intellectual and a UN official committed to standing up for justice Yet the SecretaryGenerals intellectually sound remarks calling for an understanding of the context irked Israel which accused him of supporting terrorism The UN chief indeed condemned the Hamas attack as an act of terrorism He said the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas In deference to the feelings of the Israeli people recovering from the October 7 incident in which 1130 Israelis were killed the SecretaryGeneral was sensitive enough not to stress the international law principle that people under occupation have the right to bear arms against the occupation force He was indeed more generous towards Israel as he chose not to elaborate on more than 75 years of ethnic cleansing dispossession and war crimes suffered by Palestinians at the hands of Israel Yet the Zionist state slammed him and cancelled meetings with him Since the SecretaryGenerals audacious remarks on October 24 2023 much blood has flown across the Gaza Strip Israel has killed more than 30000 Palestinians including more than 13000 children A catastrophic famine is gripping the territory Whatever is sent as international aid is barely enough to feed the population With no infant milk to feed their babies some barely a couple of months old mothers soak dates in notsoclean water wrap them in a cloth and squeeze the juice into their babies mouths In one hospital in northern Gaza doctors could give formula milk to motherless babies in incubators only twice a day instead of the minimum requirement of four times a day People are forced to eat leaves and animal food while animals eat human flesh scattered across bombarded sites Against the backdrop of this worsening humanitarian crisis that has eluded a ceasefire due to Washingtons shameless descent into moral turpitude to protect genocidecommitting Israel the context the UN SecretaryGeneral emphasised was extensively highlighted at the International Court of Justice from February 19 to 26 Fortynine countries and three international organisations presented oral submissions before the 15 judges in a case the United Nations General Assembly filed to obtain an advisory opinion on the legality of Israels occupation of Palestine The submissions presented by learned international lawyers mostly outlining the illegality of the occupation provided a clear picture of the context of the conflict Three nationsthe US Fiji and Zambiagave priority to Israels security over the Palestinians right to selfdetermination These submissions were useful not only to international law and international relations experts and students but also to government leaders and people trying to understand why Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 2023 and why Israel is committing war crimes in occupied Palestine These submissions available on the ICJs website assume the utmost significance given the Western medias attempts in their news coverage to warp or suppress the historical aspects of the Palestinian freedom struggle Noteworthy is the submission of the Arab League although the grouping is being criticised by the Arab people for its diplomatic impotency in bringing about a ceasefire to protect the Palestinian people from Israels genocidal actions Dr Ralph Wilde Senior Counsel retained by the Arab League addressed the legal questions before the court by explaining the more than centurylong denial of selfdetermination of and war against the Palestinian people on the basis of racism He pointed out the illegality of the manipulation of the League of Nations process by Britain and others to set up a Jewish state in Mandatory Palestine Here are excerpts When this began after the First World War the Jewish population of that land was 11 percent Forcibly implementing Zionism in this demographic context has necessarily involved the extermination or forced displacement of some of the nonJewish Palestinian population the exercise of domination over and subjugation dispossession and immiseration of remaining nonJewish Palestinians the emigration to that land of Jewish people regardless of any direct personal link and the denial of Palestinian refugees the right to return All operating through a racist distinction privileging Jewish people over nonJewish Palestinian people This has necessitated serious violations of all the fundamental jus cogens and erga omnes norms of international lawthe right of selfdetermination the prohibitions on aggression genocide crimes against humanity racial discrimination apartheid and tortureand the core protections of international humanitarian law The legal right of selfdetermination of the Palestinian people originates in the sacred trust obligations of Article 22 of the League Covenant part of the Versailles Treaty Palestinean A class Mandate under British colonial rulewas after the First World War supposed to have its existence as an independent State provisionally recognised a sui generis right of selfdetermination The United Kingdom and other members of the League Council attempted to bypass this incorporating the 1917 Balfour Declaration commitment to establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine into the instrument stipulating how the Mandate would operate However the Council had no legal power to bypass the Covenant in this way It acted ultra vires and the relevant provisions were legally void There was and is no legal basis in that Mandate instrument for either a specifically Jewish State in Palestine or the United Kingdoms failure to discharge the sacred trust obligation to implement Palestinian selfdetermination After the Second World War a selfdetermination right applicable to colonial peoples generally crystallised in international law For the Palestinian people this essentially corresponded to and supplemented the preexisting Covenant right regarding the same single territory The 1947 proposal to partition Palestine was contrary to this the Arab rejection was an affirmation of the legal status quo In 1948 then Palestine was legally a single territory with a single population enjoying a right of selfdetermination on a unitary basis Despite this a State of Israel specifically for Jewish people was proclaimed in 1948 by those controlling 78 percentmore than three quartersof Palestine accompanied by the forced displacement of a significant number of the nonJewish Palestinian populationthe Nakba catastrophe This illegal secession was an egregious violation of Palestinian selfdetermination Israels statehood was recognised and Israel was admitted as a United Nations member despite this illegality Israel is not the legal continuation or successor of the Mandate If as the UN chief says the context is important to understand the Palestinian question that context is the illegal existence of Israel in Palestine as has been argued before the ICJ Sadly due to Western media colonialism and the continuous diplomatic manipulations by the US Britain and likeminded Western nations the Palestinians are vilified and punished as though they are the illegal occupiers of Israel"

        "body": "With the prospect of elections this year political parties are gearing up their rhetoric and policy promises to an electorate worn out by two years of economic crisis on top of the hardship imposed by two years of a global pandemic Reckless policies in 202021 forced Sri Lanka to declare a debt default drove inflation to a peak of over 70 percent in September 2022 and contracted the GDP by over a cumulative 11 percent in 202223 The CBSL has since succeeded in stabilizing inflation at low single digits and building up international reserves while embarking on a programme to strengthen a banking system battered by the preceding economic shocks Output is showing signs of recovery with growth turning slightly positive in the third quarter of 2023 and tourism picking up Sri Lanka has reached a debt restructuring agreement in principle with official bilateral creditors and good faith discussions with international bond holders are proceeding With these signs of a longawaited turnaround it may be tempting to believe that the reforms are largely done and policies can be relaxed Declaring a premature victory has been Sri Lankas playbook and must not be repeated especially in this election year and its aftermath During previous economic difficulties we did not implement difficult structural and governance reforms once some degree of macroeconomic stabilization was achieved This stopandgo policymaking and fiscal indiscipline resulted in a high government debt ratio even before the pandemic 7090 percent of the GDP in most years during 19802019 But this time really is different because our starting point with a debt default and a public debt ratio of 126 percent of the GDP is so much worse What Will Sri Lankas Debt Restructuring Deliver The basis for all international debt restructuring including Sri Lankas is the IMFs Debt Sustainability Analysis DSA Based on the IMFs macroeconomic assumptions and policies agreed under the governments IMFsupported programme the DSA projects the countrys debt and debt service over the coming decade and beyond After taking into account the maximum fiscal adjustment that the IMF judges the country can realistically sustain it shows the amount of debt relief that creditors must provide to make the countrys debt sustainable In Sri Lankas case the government is required to run a surplus of 23 percent of GDP on its primary fiscal balance ie the fiscal balance excluding interest payments every year from 2025 until at least 2035 The DSA sets out the following criteria that a debt restructuring plan must meet Public debt to decline from 126 percent of the GDP at end2022 to below 95 percent of the GDP by end2032 The governments gross financing needs ie the financing needed to cover the primary fiscal deficit and debt service obligations to decline from 35 percent of the GDP in 2022 to an average below 13 percent of the GDP during 20272032 Foreign currency debt service to decline from 9 percent of the GDP in 2022 to below an annual ceiling of 45 percent of the GDP during 20272032 Debt relief should be sufficient to close Sri Lankas external financing gap projected at some US 17 billion during 202227 Even with a successful debt restructuring plan there is no margin for policy errors or delays The DSA shows that even after debt restructuring Sri Lanka will be vulnerable to debt distress and face a tight fiscal situation over the next decade Consider Public debt would decline only gradually staying above 100 percent of the GDP even in 202728 and reaching the still very high level of 95 percent of the GDP by 2032 above the prepandemic debt ratio of 89 percent of the GDP as at end2019 To put this debt level in perspective the general government debt to GDP ratio for emerging markets and developing countries comparators for Sri Lanka averaged 64 percent of GDP worldwide and 73 percent of GDP in Asia as at end 2022 Sri Lanka has to undertake further fiscal adjustment to increase its primary fiscal balance from a estimated deficit of 07 percent of the GDP in 2023 to a surplus of 23 percent of the GDP by 2025 and then maintain that surplus over at least the next decade As Table 1 shows we have to do much fiscal adjustments over the next two years as we did in 2023 What is more we cannot relax after that this primary surplus has to be maintained for the foreseeable future Tax revenue which increased by 2 percentage points of the GDP in 2023 must rise by an additional 3 percentage points of the GDP in 2024 and by a further 2 percentage points of the GDP in 2025 That is from the current 92 percent of the GDP to at least 14 percent of the GDP by 2025 This tax effort must also be maintained over at least the next decade And if anyone wonders why this is necessary it is worth noting that even with such a significant tax effort interest payments would take up an average of 45 percent of the tax revenue by 202728 the end of the IMFsupported programme still likely one of the highest interest payments to tax revenue ratios in the world With interest payments taking up so much of government revenue there would be very little room to increase noninterest spending The fiscal projections underlying the DSA show noninterest spending rising from the current tight 11 percent of the GDP to only 13 percent of the GDP by 202728 If we dont succeed in raising tax revenue to 14 percent of the GDP a correspondingly larger share of tax revenue would be gobbled up by interest payments leaving a smaller share for noninterest spending such as on healthcare education and poverty alleviation These considerations are not a matter of ideology They are a matter of arithmetic Sri Lankas tight fiscal situation and vulnerability to another bout of debt distress will remain whatever political ideology one espouses and whether or not we have an IMFsupported programme It would be considerably worse without the IMF Policy reversals like lowering taxes or delays in implementing structural reforms will only make matters worse If political parties want a better outcome they need to adopt policies that will deliver it Part II of this article will offer some suggestions Dr Sharmini Coorey is a former Department Director of the International Monetary Fund IMF and currently a member of the Presidential Advisory Group on Multilateral Engagement and Debt Sustainability advising the Government of Sri Lanka Her experience at the IMF includes surveillance and programme work in Africa Asia Europe and the Western Hemisphere as well as fund policy work She holds a PhD and bachelors degrees in Economics from Harvard University"

urging the authorities to streamline the legal framework so that the tourism sector would help locals and local businesses to thrive Many tour guides warn of possible consequences of neglecting the

that have been reported in recent weeks have indeed kept locals in doubt From exposs of tourists engaging in illegal businesses attempts to organise parties with face controls the darker side of allowing tourists into the country have already been revealed It is a fact that Sri Lanka needs more revenue to recover from its economic failures but critics point out that at the same time its resources and sovereignty of citizens cannot be infringed at the expense of tourists Haven for foreign investors In recent days the Daily Mirror reported that many Russian tourists stationed here longterm had resorted to running tourism related businesses in the south especially Weligama and Arugambay these enterprises severely hampering local businesses Some of these businesses owned by Russian tourists include running restaurants bars cafes and even renting out gear for water sports as well as renting tuk tuks and scootys for tourists to travel around In fact Tourism Minister Harin Fernando told Daily Mirror over the weekend that most of these foreign run businesses werent registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and they were not paying taxes In raids conducted by the authorities in recent months many Russians were deported for running businesses under tourist visas but as the issue still exists it has caused serious concerns for locals in the area However Russian owned businesses are not the only alarming concern for the local tourism industry The Daily Mirror learns that many Israeli nationals have also started local businesses in areas such as Ahangama and Weligama A local source told this newspaper that around 50 of lands in Ahangama have already been purchased by Israelis A perch of land costs around Rs 5 million given the demand As you go towards the interiors you can see that many Israeli nationals have purchased lands Some have obtained these lands on a 99year lease Many foreigners are interested in setting up hospitality

proper way These are sensitive ecosystems We need to protect the environment if we want to continue with our profession Oscar Weerasinghe Tour Guide On a visit to the area the Daily Mirror team witnessed some businesses which were owned by Israeli nationals but these businesses had a local partner All businesses were tourism related According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority website the laws relating to business organizations do not permit nonnationals to run sole proprietorship businesses However foreign investors can incorporate a resident company in Sri Lanka to operate the business Under the Companies Act of Sri Lanka a foreign company can register a private limited liability company incorporated with a minimum of two shareholders who can own the entire share capital of the company Following incorporation the company must comply with all statutory requirements imposed on domestic companies Ukrainian nationals operating businesses in the South In addition to the Israeli and Russian nationals entering the local tourism market Ukrainian tourists have also set up excursions surfing lessons threewheeler and bike rental operations and boutique hotels where the money is circulated among themselves They have their own ways of exchanging money such as undial an underground banking system hence local businesses cannot thrive due to the tourism sector anymore said Sampath Perera President Professional Tour Guide Alliance It is illegal for tourists to carry out excursions because they are not licensed tour guides Some claim that their tourist visas have expired but continue to remain in the country This is a major challenge for us because it not only creates a competition among locals and foreigners but it may also lead to clashes Thereafter bilateral ties among countries too will be severed We therefore urge the authorities to streamline the legal framework so that the tourism sector would help locals and local businesses to thrive The Department of Immigration and Emigration has already issued a notice for Russian and Ukrainian tourists to leave the country within 14 days I feel that theres a political hand involved in this issue Otherwise how can these foreigners act according to their own whims and fancies questioned Perera They have their own ways of exchanging money such as undial an underground banking system hence local businesses cannot thrive due to the tourism sector anymore Sampath Perera President Professional Tour Guide Alliance A mix of tourists There was a time when Sri Lanka promoted budget accommodation and budget travel packages for tourists Today many backpackers who visit Sri Lanka are inclined to stay at hostels that rent out rooms for as low as 5 per night as opposed to semi luxury accommodation where rooms are rented out at 20 or more per night They share costs among their groups and one may in fact wonder whether theres any benefit for the country in promoting tourism when they hardly spend any money But theres another side to the story The Daily Mirror learned that when the season begins in Down South tourists purchase rooms irrespective of whether they cost 400 or 1000 per night Sharing his views on the seasonal influx of tourists one local told the Daily Mirror that even a price of a king coconut soars to Rs 1500 during that time of the year For me it is an eyesore to see garbage dumps on either side of the roads and drains clogged with plastics etc Were leaving a negative impression on tourists Its not only about promoting beautiful videos of the island It should be a pleasant experience for them W D Lakshman Proprietor Peacock Collection Is the country clean for tourists Echoing similar sentiments W D Lakshman proprietor at Peacock Collection a souvenir shop in Ahangama said that there is always a mix of tourists Some spend thumping amounts of money while others are reserved when it comes to expenses Many tourists purchase local teas spices and other handicraft said Lakshman While acknowledging the governments efforts to attract tourists to the country Lakshman said that the Municipal Council for example should carry out more robust operations to keep the city clean For me it is an eyesore to see garbage dumps on either side of the roads and drains clogged with plastics etc Were leaving a negative impression on tourists Its not

destinations in Matara Many locals and foreigners visit this beach stretch to witness breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean But today many tour guides warn of possible consequences of neglecting the

reef is dying because most tourists dont know to do snorkeling the proper way These are sensitive ecosystems We need to protect the environment if we want to continue with our profession I carry out beach cleanups and bear the expenses But these are initiatives that the government should undertake added Weerasinghe Many tourists visit the Southern and Eastern beach stretches to learn surfing Surfing lessons are conducted at beginner intermediate and advanced levels starting from 30 onwards Weerasinghe said He added that whale watching has been temporarily halted due to oil leaks from boats The boats go at top speed and such activities disturb these animals I havent done any whale watching tours this year Its one thing to have fun but it shouldnt be done at the expense of our resources said Weerasinghe He further said that the government should have appropriate garbage disposal systems for example to ensure that the cities are clean at all times irrespective of whether they are frequented by tourists or not These are initiatives that the government can take and perform well We wonder what is being done to all the funds that they receive for tourism promotion programmes Its high time that they get their together he added No response from Harsha Several attempts made to contact Harsha Ilukpitiya Controller General at the Department of Immigration and Emigration to inquire about the visa status of foreign nationals who are carrying out businesses locally proved futile In addition to the Israeli and Russian nationals entering the local tourism market Ukrainian tourists have also set up excursions surfing lessons threewheeler and bike rental operations"

        "body": "The order by the Controller of Immigration and Emigration revealed the FROG IN THE WELL mindset of the bureaucrats who rule the roost This singular stupidity however has economic and potential geopolitical consequences that Sri Lanka cannot afford The government should rescind the order and mitigate the negative publicity What would commonsensical authorities do when tourists are found to run businesses illegally Never mind that is not a hassle unique to Sri Lanka Raid illegal ventures Set up a mechanism to bring them into the tax net Require them to comply with local regulations Reform restrictive local laws considering that businesses operate illegally in the first place due to a labyrinth of red tape that fosters graft and corruption No The best that the warped minds of the Department of Immigration and Emigration could come up was to order the Russian and Ukrainian tourists who stay in the country on extended visas to leave within 14 days According to official data around 288000 Russians and nearly 20000 Ukrainians have travelled to Sri Lanka in the last two years since the RussiaUkraine war began The directive came in the backdrop of two separate incidents One was a whiteonly party organized by a Russian DJ in Unawatuna the event was abandoned after a social media frenzy The second is what appears to be exaggerated reports of the tourists running unregistered businesses and some engaging in prostitution The order by the Controller of Immigration and Emigration was neither proportionate nor took into account the wider consequences of its decision If anything it revealed the frog in the well mindset of the bureaucrats who rule the roost This singular stupidity however has economic and potential geopolitical consequences that Sri Lanka cannot afford The government should rescind the order do so publicly and mitigate the negative publicity that it had already generated Consequences of the Folly Consider some consequences The Russians are the second largest source of tourists to the country only after India In the backdrop of the decrease in Chinese tourists which accounted for the largest share until the pandemic owning to economic conditions in the mainland it would be a monumental mistake to risk the Russian market simply because one bureaucratic fool could not see the big picture Now do a simple Google search on the Sri Lankan Immigration Controller ordering the Russians and Ukrainians to leave and see how the story is splashed around the world from the Moscow Times to the Independent UK Bad news flies This kind of bureaucratic stupidity overwhelms the millions of dollars and hard work of the Ministry of Tourism in promoting Sri Lanka as a welcoming destination Secondly consider grassroots economics Russians and Ukrainians who stay on extended visas support the local economy especially in the Down South where they are concentrated They rent houses and patronize local shops eateries restaurants and tuktuks Most of them are digital nomads whose earnings contribute to the local economy By their long stay and local knowledge they serve as a nexus for their compatriots in their home countries who might want to travel or shift places Having folks already rooted here would be more likely to encourage them to travel here than go to Turkey or Thailand An industrious Ministry of Tourism should have used these groups as grassroots ambassadors Geopolitics Thirdly consider the geopolitics The Russian Embassy might suspect a hidden hand of the rival foreign powers because an average foreigner might find it hard to believe that local bureaucrats are capable of this amount of selfharming stupidity The last time Sri Lanka banned Russian asbestos Moscow one of the largest markets for Sri Lankan tea retaliated and required Sri Lankan tea exports to undergo stringent tests The government of Maithripala Sirisena wasted no time lifting the ban on asbestos Then in 2022 the Colombo Commercial Court issued an order to seize a Russianowned Airbus A330 acting on a commercial dispute filed by an Irish firm in the backdrop of Western sanctions on Russia But commonsense prevailed and the plane was released after intervention by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs The Russian Embassy is awaiting the report of an investigation launched by the Presidents Office into the directive issued by the Controller of Immigration After the Presidents office raised concerns the directive was removed from the website of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Board However the government has not officially rescinded the directive This sends conflicting messages It does not take much for the President to revoke the order and provide clarity Fourthly it is about commonsense decency and civility The vast majority of Russians and Ukrainians are here on extended visas because of the war in their countries Some may be dogging the draft others fear for their lives It is inconsiderate to ask them to leave A country lacking that basic empathy is a miserable place Next ask why tourists would run an unregistered business Investment laws in this country are a labyrinth of red tape leaving the wouldbe investor at the mercy of a corrupt and incompetent bureaucracy The government should reform the arcane laws and consider bringing in touristrun businesses such as restaurants and travel agencies within the tax net and employment regulations Anyone who runs a business that discriminates based on colour race or gender should be held accountable under the appropriate local law that applies both to foreigners and locals some locally owned ventures in Mirissa made headlines refusing to serve locals Curbing such discriminatory practices should be the job of the Police In the meantime the President should revoke the directive by the Controller of Immigration The Head of State should make it clear that Sri Lanka is a welcoming destination for visitors Follow RangaJayasuriya

        "body": "MP Sritharan has clearly stated his vision is NOT for the setting up of a separate state Ever since Mr S Sritharan was elected leader of the Federal Party or the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ITAK numerous articles with a racist bent have begun appearing in a number of national news outlets in Colombo The articles have a common thread running through them Sritharans visit to the LTTE war heroes cemetery in Killinochchi and their nationalist writers interpretation of the symbolism of that visit One of these Prophets of Doom even went to the extent of giving a timeline when the next round of bombings would hit the country In their myopic vision Sritharans visit exposed him as an apologist of the LTTE and an unmitigated separatist He is now being paraded via the media as an enemy Most of these writers knowledge and interaction with the new ITAK leader is superficial What they refuse to see is that Sritharan has lived through the 30 years of war He has lived with the Tamil people be it in the north or the east and lived through the suffering and terror the various Sinhalese dominated governments in Colombo unleashed on ordinary Tamil civilians in a thinly veiled guise of fighting terrorism Their simplistic categorisation does not take into consideration the insults and indignities ordinary Tamils had to put up with at the hands of Sinhalese leaders and diverse governments which ruled the country We Lankans received independence from our colonial masters seventysix years ago Since then we have overseen a series of racist attacks against minority communities and a near threedecadelong ethnic war followed by attacks on two minority religious communities ITAK Leader S Sritharan Ordinary Tamils see in the LTTE and the Tamil militants who took up arms to defend their culture language and race as heroes It was only then governments irrespective of political party affiliation showed a willingness to even discuss Tamil grievances seriously Not unnaturally the militants were looked on as heroes by ordinary civilian Tamils Sadly none of our writers turned security experts bother to identify the culprits behind the racial attacks or learn the lessons of how such situations could be avoided Their aim appears to let minorities understand their place in Lankan society Prior to independence the Tamil political leadership had expressed fears the unitary nature of the constitution did not provide adequate protection to minority communities against Sinhala majoritarianism Tamil leaders had called for constitutional protections to allay these fears One of the recommendations being the reservation of 50 per cent of Parliamentary seats and Cabinet posts for minorities Their suggestions were sadly thrown out of the window sotosay The passing of the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1947 the first Act passed by the first independent government of our country justified these fears The legislation effectively disfranchised the Upcountry Tamils It renewed fears among Tamils that the Sinhalese majority was using its numerical superiority to bulldoze through legislation adversely affecting minority communities in the island The disfranchisement of the Upcountry Tamils in the end led to the formation of the Federal Party FP which called for a federal system of government with greater internal autonomy for the different districts Unfortunately opportunistic leaders seeking cheap popularity among Sinhala voters roused communalism by misinterpreting the call for greater autonomy as that of a division of the country The first seeds of SinhalaTamil communalism had begun to sprout By 1956 the economy was in a downward spiral The language of administration was English Yet the Universities continued churning out thousands of Sinhala educated graduates who were unable to find employment in either the government or mercantile sector due to their lack of knowledge of the English language Opportunistic elements exploited the situation claiming members of the Tamil community dominated the administrative services of the country to the detriment of the Sinhalese It was in this atmosphere the 1956 General Elections were held and brought into power a coalition of forces led by SWRD Bandaranaike who had campaigned on a ticket of Sinhala Only and won the election by a landslide The new government passed the Official Language Act commonly known as the Sinhala Only Act making Sinhala the sole official language of the country The Act triggered discontent among the Tamils who perceived their language culture and economic position as being subject to increasing threats As relations between the two communities worsened Premier Bandaranaike attempted to assuage Tamil fears by entering into an agreement with the leader of the Federal Party Chelvanayakam The Pact known as the BandaChelva Pact contained provisions for the recognition of Tamil as the language of administration for the Northern and Eastern provinces However opportunistic and racial forces railed against the concessions given to the Tamil people The premier ultimately abrogated the pact unilaterally Shortly thereafter the first major communal riots broke out in 1958 Since 1956 periodic violence against Tamils broke out in different parts of the country for example in 1958 1961 1977 1981 and in 1983 According to the late PLOTE leader Uma Maheswaran a complete breakdown between Sinhalese and Tamil people occurred when the Communist Party of Sri Lanka CPSL and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party LSSP that were staunchly secular led racist demonstrations against the Dudley SenanayakeChelvanayakam Pact of 1965 During those demonstrations the CPSL and the LSSP leaders also participated mouthing racist slogans such as Dudleyge bade masala vadai etc All trust Tamils had in the Sinhalese he said broke down during this period The 1971 Standardisation of Education policy which curtailed the number of Tamil students entering universities proved to be the proverbial straw that broke the camels back It led to a complete change in the demands of the Tamil community and led to the demand for the setting up of a separate state The governments attack on the World Tamil Conference in 1974 in which seven Tamil civilians died when police attacked a cultural festival exacerbated an already deteriorating illfeeling between the communities These are but some instances of oppression unleashed on the Tamil community The Muslim community too has experienced similar discrimination A majority of the Burgher community felt it was impossible to stave off the majoritarian attitudes of the Sinhalese To our eternal shame the Burghers left this land and are now domiciled in Australia where they have been given the space to weave themselves into the fabric of that nation The new ITAK leaders actions have to be viewed in this backdrop He was honouring those who died fighting against state oppression of his community MP Sritharan has clearly stated his vision is NOT for the setting up of a separate state Rather it is for greater autonomy and selfgovernment within a federal setup The problem here is the ill will some people harbour against minority communities and their aspirations within our country Numerous public demonstrations are held honouring the late JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera who led two bloody uprisings against the state That is acceptable because he was a Sinhalese However honouring members of a minority community who also revolted for their cause is forbidden O tempora o mores Cant we ever stop thinking along narrow parochial lines of Sinhala Tamil Muslim and Burgher We do not even give the original people of this land the indigenous Veddah community preferential treatment amidst the neglect they continue to suffer despite 76 years of independence We have not even accepted the theory of reserving lands exclusively for them to preserve their traditions and culture Getting back to the subject of honouring memories of fallen heroes Sinhalese nationalists and psuedopatriots cannot stomach such ideas So they denounce and hurl abuse and insults Honouring those who fought to set up a separate state does not make one a separatist or a traitor In the United States for instance the US Confederate Memorial Day is observed as a holiday in several Southern US states since the end of the American Civil War The holiday is to commemorate the estimated 258000 Confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War Until we are able to look at each other as equal citizens of this country we will remain a divided country open to intrigues of diverse forces seeking to use us for their benefit"

        "body": "Deceased Russian Opposition Leader Aleksei Navalny The sudden mysterious death of Aleksei Navalny the charismatic Russian Opposition Leader imprisoned on trumped up charges came as a shock to many Its not totally surprising however given the long list of Russians killed by gunmen or by poisoning over the past decade They all have one thing in common running afoul of the Kremlin which is Vladimir Putin for one reason or another The shadowy Yevgeny Prigozhin Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group with close ties to Putin who led an armed rebellion against Putin from Ukraine in June 2023 died in a plane crash with top associates in August 2023 Little noticed was the murder of Maksim Kuzminov a Russian helicopter pilot who defected from the fighting in Ukraine He was shot dead in February this year near Alicante in Spain Spanish intelligence services accused the Kremlin of orchestrating the killing Its interesting to compare this defection and the unforgiving reaction to it with that of Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko who defected in 1976 to Japan with the Soviets latest MiG 25 interceptor when Nikolai Podgorny was President of the former USSR Though the Kremlin vehemently protested Belenko was allowed to settle down in the US and live peacefully as an aeronautical engineer The interesting thing is that while repressing critics and opponents was official policy from Stalin to Brezhnev Putins new Russia does not resort to mass arrests exiles and large scale show trials to maintain its grip on power Just by targeting a few individuals it is able to silence the population with fear of what might happen if they speak out In 2003 veteran politician and leader of the antiKremlin party Liberal Russia Sergei Yushenkov was shot in front of his Moscow home He led efforts by liberal lawmakers to investigate the possible involvement of the Russian Federal Security Service FSB in a series of deadly apartment bombings in 1999 which killed some 300 people Moscow put the blame on Chechen militants and used it as a pretext to launch the Second Chechen War In October 2006 Anna Politkovskaya one of Russias most prominent journalists and a persistent chronicler of rights abuses in Chechnya was shot dead in her apartment building in an executionstyle killing The following month former Russian security agent Aleksander Litvinenko died in London after being poisoned with radioactive polonium210 Litvinenko had fled to Britain in 2000 after accusing the FSB of plotting to kill oligarch Boris Berezovsky He later coauthored a book blaming the agency for the 1999 apartmentbuilding bombings In July 2009 Natalya Estemirova the renowned human rights activist was abducted and killed in Grozny the capital of Chechnya She had been investigating hundreds of suspected rights abuses in Chechnya including kidnapping and murder The rights group she worked for Memorial said initial investigations pointed to the possible involvement of local law enforcement officers Four months later the whistleblowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who had implicated Russian officials in an alleged 230 million tax fraud died one year after being jailed on similar charges He suffered from pancreatitis and was denied medical care in pretrial detention conditions rights activists said were tantamount to torture According to the Kremlins own human rights council he was badly beaten before his death In February 2015 Boris Nemtsov the reformist former regional governor and deputy Prime Minister was shot dead in a ganglandstyle killing on a bridge near the Kremlin at age 55 He was a rising political star in the 1990s but became one of Putins most vocal opponents He staunchly opposed Russias aggression against Ukraine in 2014 calling it despicable impudent and harmful for Russia The interesting thing is that while repressing critics and opponents was official policy from Stalin to Brezhnev Putins new Russia does not resort to mass arrests exiles and large scale show trials to maintain its grip on power Just by targeting a few individuals it is able to silence the population with fear of what might happen if they speak out It isnt clear yet how Navalny aged 47 died He survived poisoning with nerve gas in 2020 and chose to return to Russia He was immediately arrested and sent to a harsh Siberian prison He didnt get the medical care he needed There is no official cause of death given yet but it looks very much like the same old story Vlad Vexler a Russian philosopher now living in Britain says while speaking on the death of Navalny that the Russian population is now largely depoliticized This is precisely what strongmen rulers or dictators want consumers rather than critics It isnt clear yet how Navalny aged 47 died He survived poisoning with nerve gas in 2020 and chose to return to Russia He was immediately arrested and sent to a harsh Siberian prison He didnt get the medical care he needed There is no official cause of death given yet but it looks very much like the same old story Navalny was a political dissident in the historical Russian tradition of Belinksy and Bakunin Putin loathed him so much he refused to mention Navalnys name in public Vexler calls Navalny an ambitious politician who was trying to politicise the Russians a radically depoliticised people He says Navalny had two weaknesses one minor and one major An unwillingness to build coalitions was the minor weakness The lack of a political alternative necessary to go along with a politicisation programme was the major weakness He was staunchly anticorruption but that didnt amount to an alternative political programme According to Vexler Navalny wasnt a visionary politician like Mikhail Gorbachev But he was the only Russian opposition politician who had the means of politicizing todays Russians Putin saw that the new generation was not with him Vexler says they were not with the older generation either and not necessary liberal and believing in Navalny But Putin would have spotted the danger If there was anyone there who could convert the new generation Russians to a cause it was Navalny And now hes gone and there is no one who can fill that void Vexler says Navalny died battling something which the Ukranians are battling every day and its not just a problem of the exSoviet space Rather it is a problem that will engulf all of Russia if people dont rise up to the challenge and face it"

        "body": "The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes is the sheer disregard by the government for the two main principles of taxation namely fairness and consistency These days tax has become the talk of the town the laughingstock and the attractive subject matter for cartoonists The general public perceives it as a legalized robbery executed by the state using rules and regulations backed by the threat of legal consequences for noncompliances The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes is the sheer disregard by the government of the two main principles of taxation namely the fairness ability to pay and consistency The Publics Revulsion This perception of legalized robbery is gaining momentum among the general public especially in the backdrop of the unparalleled financial crisis and skyrocketing cost of living while the income of the public has been drastically slashed The collection of taxes is likened to the collecting of nectar from flowers by bees with mutual benefits in friendly atmospheres I still remember when I said the above analogy one of the taxpayers at a tax seminar where I participated as the resource person quipped that the collection of tax nowadays was like a cheetah hunting a deer echoing the deeprooted mutual misunderstanding prevailing among the taxpayers and tax officials Taxpayers Antipathy More than 95 of the tax revenue comes from the selfassessment basis namely from the voluntary payment of taxes by taxpayers and the balance of 5 of the additional tax which is called the back duty is collected through tax auditing In order to get this 5 additional tax the existing tax base is squeezed or rather subject to further tax auditing and the issuance of an estimated assessment by rejecting the selfassessment tax returns furnished by taxpayers which leads to several adverse consequences including harassment and malpractice The reason for the fundamental difference in issuing amended assessments in terms of the provisions of the new Act and the old Acts is the different legal interpretation on tax evasion The new Act views it as a criminal offense sections 186 189 of the Act while the same tax evasion was considered a civil offense by the previous tax acts Necessary Evil of Tax Auditing We have the selfassessment system which taxpayers themselves compute and pay their taxes It is needless to emphasize that auditing or rather the fear of being audited by tax officials is instrumental in ensuring taxpayers substantial compliance with the tax laws The discretionary power given by the tax statutes to tax officials plays a considerable role in it Discretionary power is the authority that allows an administrative agency or official to choose the most reasonable decision among several options following public and private interests It is not a secret that such discretionary power given to tax officials works as a doubleedged sword while it has made taxpayers comply with the tax laws it has also made them hate and run away from the tax system Discretionary Power is not a WildAss Freedom It is to be highlighted here that such discretionary powers are not absolute but restricted and conditional so that tax officials cannot misuse it The difference between absolute and restricted discretionary power was clearly explained by Justice Fernando in the famous case of De Silva vs Athukorale 1993 1 SLR 283 at pp 296297 An ordinary person may dispose of his property as he may wish at any price since he has the absolute power to sell it However a public officer cannot dispose of a public property as his power is restricted He has to act reasonably and in good faith and upon the lawful and relevant grounds of public interest The act of the ordinary person cannot be challenged in a court of law as he has the unfettered and unrestricted power and freedom to act as he wants However the act of the public officer can be challenged in a court of law as his power and freedom to act are restricted The Imposition of Tax on a Taxpayer and the Power of a Tax Official Since taxation is a delicate and sensitive matter the Parliament has retained the absolute right to impose a tax on a person Article 148 of the Constitution is very particular on this subject Parliament shall have full control over public finance No tax rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law No tax could be imposed on a person except by a clear law passed by Parliament So the imposition of a tax or an additional tax back duty on a taxpayer through an amended assessment must be referred to a section of the tax law passed by Parliament Giving Reason for an Amended Assessment is a Mandatory Requirement The imposition of an amended tax by a tax official through rejection of a tax return be it income tax or VAT of taxpayer without giving a reason and without referring to a section of the tax law is invalid Generally it is observed that notices of tax assessments are issued citing the conclusions of the tax officials such as those mentioned below as the reasons for the rejections without referring to any section of the tax statute The declared gross profit margin was insufficient or Declared turnover is unacceptable insufficient Tax assessments based on such reasons are legally not valid due to two reasons The given reason is the conclusion which is subjective while the reason is objective and the other is the failure of the tax officials to link the reason with a section of the law passed by Parliament Unique Section of 1351 of the Act The principal section for issuing an amended assessment is 1351 of the Inland Revenue Act No 24 of 2017 On looking at this section it becomes clear that the rejection is linked to two fundamental conditions They are the availability of the evidence and the best judgement based on it Subject to this section the Assistant Commissioner may amend a tax assessment referred to in this section as the original assessment by making such alterations or additions based on such evidence as may be available and to the best of his judgement to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a tax period to ensure that in any other case the taxpayer is liable for the correct amount of tax payable including a nil amount in respect of the tax period to which the original assessment relates There was no such section in the previous tax statutes imposing similar restrictions and conditions evidence best judgement and ensuring the correct amount of tax liability on a tax official for the issuing of an amended assessment The reason for this fundamental difference in issuing amended assessments in terms of the provisions of the new Act and the old Acts is the different legal view on tax evasion The new Act views it as a criminal offense sections 186 189 of the Act while the same tax evasion was considered a civil offense by the previous tax acts Hence it is evident that an imposition of additional tax by a tax official on a taxpayer without clear evidence that is based on the best of his judgement is legally invalid and its validity could be successfully challenged through the process of appeal Benefit of a Doubt to be given to Taxpayers When looking at the Act with a helicopter view it is patently clear that the Act looks at taxpayers as genuine and honest unless and until they are proved otherwise Further it is well settled law that tax matters should be handled with clear and plain language without any ambiguity and the benefit of a doubt if any in the interpretation of the law should be decided in favour of the taxpayers The Supreme Court observed in Vallibel Lanka Pvt Ltd verses Director General of Customs SC Appeal No 262008 that In cases of doubt the provisions are construed most strongly against the state and in favour of citizens It is a matter of regret that the perception of the general public is that the benefit of a doubt in case of interpretation of a tax law is taken by tax officials to themselves and it is denied to taxpayers

regard are highly appreciated First two documents have been uploaded to the IRD web portal while the next two documents are yet to be published despite the fact that the note beneath the respective two documents says that in order to ensure transparency and fair play this circular is published in the official IRD website It is not a secret that the two documents are already in the hands of the general public In this backdrop it is better for the present administration of the IRD to take a prompt step to upload those two important documents to the IRD website for the purpose of ensuring transparency and accountability and for the protection of rights and obligations of the general public and taxpayers Features of the two documents that are yet to be uploaded to IRD website The said two documents were issued for multiple reasons including as part of the Extended Fund Facility of the IMF Several longedfor features and guidelines have been incorporated in the Instruction to issue an Additional or Amended Assessment A few of them were Auditing is not a rule but an exception No audit of the tax return is to be initiated without any prima facie or material factsWritten prior approval should be obtained from the Commissioner of the Unit on the submission of a report consisting of such material factsAny audit should be initiated at least ten months before the assessment gets timebarredAn amended assessment if any should be finalized at least two months before the assessment gets time barredIf a tax official cannot comply with the instructions specified in the document special approval is to be obtained from the CGIR to proceed with the assessment The Scope of the Administrative Review has been limited especially to verification of whether the instructions specified by the CGIR in the circular Instruction to issue an Additional or Amended Assessment were followed among a few other facts Tax matters should be handled with clear and plain language without any ambiguity and the benefit of a doubt if any in the interpretation of the law should be decided in favour of the taxpayers It is a matter of regret that the perception of the general public is that the benefit of a doubt in case of interpretation of a tax law is taken by tax officials to themselves and it is denied to taxpayers As a result the taxpayers have to seek assistance from the superior courts incurring heavy losses of finances time and energy Changing the Legalized Robbery as the Social Responsibility The tax statutes and the CGIR have given inter alia the following guarantees and assurances to the taxpayers and the general public for the purpose of ensuring the rights of the taxpayers and the taxing rights of the state in a taxpayerfriendly environment Taxpayers are honest and genuine until and unless proved otherwise A tax audit is not a rule but an exception Discretionary powers given to tax officials are not absolute but restricted and fettered The benefit of a doubt in the interpretation of the law should be given to taxpayers The imposition of additional tax should be accompanied by a reference to a section of the tax law and with strong evidence to the best of the judgement of the tax official A clear valid reason should be communicated to the taxpayer for the rejection of his tax return Had the guarantees given by the Act and the IRD for the protection of the rights of the taxpayers as well as the taxing rights of the state been truly and honestly upheld by the tax officials the perspective of the public on taxation as legalized robbery would be changed to social responsibility As a result tax evasion could be considerably minimized It is important that the general public and the taxpayers educate themselves of their rights and obligations without resorting to shortcuts Being equipped with the knowledge of any subject is the powerful tool to combat the misuse of that subject Hence taxation is not a monster but our ignorance and the attitude of certain tax officials are the monster The writer is Retired Deputy Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue Department He can be contacted at mifly1234gmailcom"

        "body": "The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ITAK known in English as the Federal Party FP is in the eye of a legal storm The premier political party representing the Sri Lankan Tamils of the Northern and Eastern provinces is currently undergoing an internal crisis mainly due to recently held innerparty elections Issues relating to the intraparty elections have brought about a clearly visible divide within the ITAK This in turn has led to an unprecedented situation where two members of the ITAK have sought legal recourse against allegedly illegal action by party authorities Enjoining orders were obtained Party Leaders were restrained from conducting its postponed National Convention on 19 February ITAK leaders were also restrained from implementing decisions made by the Partys General Council on 21 and 27 January 2024 The General Council known as Podhuchabhai comprises members of the Central Working Committee and representatives elected by the partys district branches The stay order was issued on 15 February for 2 weeks until 29 February As a result of the court orders the ITAK National Convention did not take place as planned on 19 February Furthermore courts have also restrained ITAK Party Leaders from implementing decisions reached at the party General Council meetings on Jan 21 and 27 The decisions reached on the two days were the election of a new party President on January 21 and the election of other office bearers on 27 January Hence all the new party office bearers including the new President Sivagnanam Shritharan are debarred temporarily from functioning in their posts As is the case with most democratic political parties the ITAK too has several internal divisions The fault lines within the ITAK came to the fore when the partys General Council elected a new President Secretary and other key office bearers in Trincomalee on 21 and 27 January 2024 These elections and their implications have been discussed by this writer in two articles published in our sister newspaper Daily FT on 24 January and 9 February 2024 respectively The new office bearers for the years 202426 were to be ceremonially announced at the party convention earlier scheduled for January 28 However the old ITAK President Maavai Senathirajah in a controversial move unilaterally announced that the convention was being postponed indefinitely due to differences of opinion within the party This had the tacit support of the new ITAK president Sivagnanam Shritharan After some days it was announced that the party convention would be held in Trincomalee on February 19 What happened next was that some party members sought legal intervention on 15 February to prevent the party convention from being held on February 19 on the basis that the number which voted at the elections was in excess of the numbers allocated to the General Council in terms of the ITAK party constitution They also challenged the legality of the elections of office bearers on the basis that procedures set out in the party constitution were not followed Consequentially the District Courts of Trincomalee and Jaffna issued Enjoining Orders staying the ITAK from holding its party convention or General Council meeting on February 19 This resulted in the party convention not being held on February 19 The Trincomalee Courts have also effectively stayed the functioning of the newly elected office bearers Trincomalee Trincomalee was the venue of the ITAK General Council conclaves The National Convention was also to be held there In Trincomalee the complaint was filed by lawyer Aishwarya Sivakumar on behalf of Para Chandrasekaram the owner of Para Hotel and a resident of Konesapuri in Saambaltheevu He is a member of the ITAK in the Trincomalee District When the case was heard by Trincomalee District Judge Manickavasagam Ganesharajah on 15 February Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC along with AttorneyatLaw Purantharan appeared for the petitioner Seven ITAK leaders were named as respondents They were Somasundaram Senathirajah Sivagnanam Shritharan MA Sumanthiran Shanmugam Kugathasan Pathmanathan Sathialingam Seenithamby Yogeswaran and Xavier Kulanayagam Of these Senathirajah known as Maavai was the ITAK President from 2014 to 2024 He remained as President officially on 21 January when 321 members of the ITAK General Council voted to elect a new President Shritharan was elected as the new ITAK President with a 47 majority on January 21 Sumanthiran was a candidate at the party Presidential poll He obtained 137 votes The winner Shritharan got 184 Both Shritharan and Sumanthiran are Jaffna district MPs Maavai is a former Jaffna MP Shanmugam Kugathasan is the ITAK Trincomalee District Chairman He was elected as the new General Secretary of the ITAK on 27 January Pathmanathan Sathialingam a medical doctor was functioning as the Acting General Secretary of the ITAK until a new secretary was elected on the 27th He is a former Northern Provincial Council Minister Seenithamby Yogeswaran is a former Batticaloa District MP He was also a candidate for the ITAK Presidency but withdrew in favour of Shritharan Xavier Kulanayagam was elected as the ITAKs new Deputy General Secretary on January 27 He was earlier the partys Administrative Secretary Enjoining Orders After hearing submissions praying for an Interim Injunction on behalf of Petitioner Para Chandrasekaram Trincomalee District Judge Manickavasagar Ganesharajah issued two Enjoining Orders valid for 14 days until 29 February when the next hearing is scheduled One enjoining order restrained the seven defendants namely Messrs Senathirajah Shritharan Sumanthiran Kugathasan Sathialingam Yogeswaran and Kulanayagam from holdingconducting the purported National Convention on 19 February 2024 until the hearing and determination of the application for an injunction The other Enjoining Order restrained the seven defendants Senathirajah Shritharan Sumanthiran Kugathasan Sathialingam Yogeswaran and Kulanayagam from implementing any of the purported decisions taken at the purported General Council meetings held on 21 and 27 January 2024 until the hearing and determination of the application for an injunction The Trincomalee Courts Enjoining Order has restrained the party from implementing decisions taken by the General Council on January 21 and 27 What this meant was that the party Presidential election on January 21 and the election of other office bearers on January 27 cannot be followed through None of those elected can function in their posts until the Courts make their final decision The stay order is likely to be extended further unless an amicable agreement is reached The new office bearers elected are as follows President Sivagnanam Shritharan Senior Vice President CVK Sivagnanam Vice Presidents Charles Nirmalanathan T Kalaiarasan P Ariyanendran P Sathialingam and KV Thavarasa General Secretary Shanmugam Kugathasan Deputy General Secretary Xavier Kulanayagam Assistant Secretaries Shanthi Sriskandarajah Ranjani Kanagarajah Krishnapillai Seyon T Krukularajah E Saravanabavan and C Sivamohan Joint Treasurers P Kanagasabapathy and Gnanamuthu Sreenesan Currently none of these persons can function in the posts they were elected to Jaffna The ITAK party headquarters is located at Martin Road in Jaffna Peter Ilanchezhiyan a member of the ITAK Central Working Committee petitioned the Jaffna District Court seeking an injunction against the postponed ITAK National Convention being held in Trincomalee on 19 February Ilanchezhiyan is the son of former Northern Provincial Council Deputy Chairman Anton Jeyanathan and the nephew of ITAK Deputy General Secretary Xavier Kulanayagam When the ITAK General Council meeting was in progress on January 27 Ilanchezhiyan had openly declared that he would go to Courts if the party constitution was not adhered to Ilanchezhiyans application was heard by Jaffna District Judge Sinnathurai Sathiswaran Lawyer Kumaravadivel Guruparan appeared on behalf of Peter Ilanchezhiyan Five Persons were named as respondents They were Somasundaram Senathirajah Sivagnanam Shritharan Shanmugam Kugathasan Pathmanathan Sathialingam and Xavier Kulanayagam Senathirajah and Shritharan are the old and new party Presidents respectively Kugathasan and Kulanayagam are the new General Secretary and Deputy General Secretary Sathiyalingam is the former Deputy General Secretary cum Acting General Secretary In his submissions Guruparan stated that the party constitution had been violated in constituting the General Council Persons far in excess of the numbers eligible had attended the General Council meeting and voted at the election Procedures set out in the party constitution were not followed Some of the posts had been filled unlawfully Counsel Guruparan further stated that the holding of the party convention was improper because the party constitution stipulated that 21 days notice should be given in the media before the convention was held This had not been done An injunction against the National Convention being held on February 19 was sought After hearing the submissions the Courts issued an Enjoining Order The convention was not held on the February 19 Maavai Senathirajah Several acts of commission and omission by ITAK leaders over the years have culminated in the current crisis The main share of the blame should be borne by Maavai Senathirajah who functioned as party President for 10 years from 2014 to 2024 Senathirajah was the immediate cause for the present problem too It was he who arbitrarily postponed the ITAK convention indefinitely Otherwise it would have been held without any hitch on January 28 Senathirajah postponed the convention unilaterally and illegitimately on the pretext that a group of persons from Batticaloa were objecting to the election of Shanmugam Kugathasan of Trincomalee as the new ITAK General Secretary They were demanding that the post should be given to Gnanamuthu Srinesan a former Batticaloa district MP Though ExPresident Senathirajah was not empowered to do so he announced a postponement of the party convention until the issue was solved by electing a new General Secretary Shritharan and Sumanthiran met Senathirajah In that meeting Sumanthiran emphasised that the election of Kugathasan as General Secretary was valid in fact and law The Central Working Committee had endorsed it unanimously The General Council had accepted it unanimously Thereafter it had been put to the vote also and carried forward with 112 voting in favour and 104 against Therefore it was not correct for Senathirajah to have postponed the convention on the basis that a new Secretary had to be elected Senathirajah disagreed He said that he was going to Singapore for his sons wedding and would be back in Sri Lanka on 10 February He would reconvene a General Council meeting after his return and resolve the issue Shritharan was amenable to Maavais suggestion Srinesan and the Batticaloa group were Shritharans supporters Kugathasan was perceived as being in the Sumanthiran camp Sumanthiran then said that Senathirajahs suggestion was contrary to the ITAK party constitution Senathirajah then retorted We dont have to always work according to the party constitution Sumanthiran responded that violating the party constitution was unacceptable and could have legal consequences Senathirajah with tacit support from Shritharan disregarded Sumanthirans legal advice and went off to Singapore Gentlemans Agreement After Senathirajah returned an unofficial meeting was held in which an arrangement was arrived at A gentlemans agreement was reached where Kugathasan would function as General Secretary for one year Thereafter he would resign and Srinesan would function as General Secretary for a year Thus the two year term of office was to be divided as one year each This was followed by another announcement that the party convention would be held on 19 February 2024 Subsequently it was announced that the ITAK General Council too would be reconvened and a mini election held It was said that in terms of the ITAK constitution it was the Deputy General Secretary who would automatically become General Secretary if the latter resigned As such it would be Deputy General Secretary Kulanayagam who would become General Secretary if Kugathasan resigned Srinesan who had been elected joint Treasurer could not replace Kugathasan Hence it was said that the General Council would be convened to hold two elections Srinesan would become Deputy General Secretary and Kulanayagam Joint Treasurer This was followed by a meeting between veteran ITAK Trincomalee MP Rajavarothayam Sampanthan and Shritharan who was accompanied by ITAK Wanni MP Charles Nirmalanathan Tamil newspapers reported that Sampanthan had declared at the meeting that conspiracies should be thwarted and fresh elections to all posts in the ITAK should be held This caused a major upset in the ITAK circles The party grapevine began humming that the idea of convening the General Council was not to have a minielection but to have a major poll in which fresh elections were to be held for all the office bearers elected on January 27 It was strongly believed that people suspected of being Sumanthiran loyalists were going to be replaced by Shritharan supporters Financial incentives provided by Tamil Diaspora elements were going to play a role as in the case of the party Presidential election of January 21 Rules norms and procedures laid out in the ITAK Constitution were going to be brazenly flouted Constitutionalism Fought Back It was then that the ITAK constitution or Constitutionalism fought back The legal action initiated in Trincomalee and Jaffna was on the basis that the party constitution was not being adhered to An Interim Injunction was sought After ex parte proceedings the courts have issued enjoining orders The crucial question that arises is what the ITAK leaders propose to do It is blatantly obvious that the ITAK constitution has been flagrantly violated Protracted legal proceedings may tie up the party in knots There is also the danger of potential intervention by the Elections Commission The party runs the risk of losing its registration and popular House symbol Crux of the Matter This writer consulted some members of the legal fraternity over the ITAK legal wrangle According to these legal eagles the crux of the matter is the composition of the ITAK General Council and the decisions taken by this body on the 21st and 27th of January 2024 The problem arose when Shritharans supporters disputed the decisions taken on the 27th of January and made attempts to change them The legal challenges seem to be a defensive response to those perceived attempts If Shritharan and his supporters provide an assurance that no changes will be made to those decisions and that the newly elected office bearers including the General Secretary and Deputy General Secretary will be allowed to function in their posts there are chances of persuading the two plaintiffs to withdraw the cases If this is not done the cases will drag on and even the position of Shritharan who was elected President on January 21st could be challenged Saner Counsel As stated earlier the ITAK is in the eye of a legal storm Unless and until saner counsel prevails within the upper echelons of the ITAK the party seems headed for protracted legal proceedings DBS Jeyaraj can be

        "body": "US Ambassador Linda ThomasGreenfield casting the veto vote against the UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza AFP Burying the values the United States presidents often speak highly of during their policy speeches Washington once again inhumanely used its veto power at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to kill Algerias resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip It is revolting to see Washingtons UN envoy Linda ThomasGreenfield a political science lecturer diplomat and private sector executive not known for human rights or humanitarian activism raise her hand at the UNSC to veto the resolution This was the third time her hand went up in support of genocide ethnic cleansing and Israels war crimes in the Gaza Strip As a paid servant of the US administration she does whatever she is commanded to do by President Joe Biden who is being flayed on social media as Genocide Joe Thickskinned and stonehearted she will not resign her post in frustration at her governments continuous refusal to back a ceasefire in Gaza though resignation is what is expected of an official with conscience and compassion in the heart if the command of the government is to do the wrong thing It is only in horror movies that we see agents of vampires work to fulfil their masters insatiable hunger for human bloodnot in the key policymaking body of the august international organisation set up to save successive generations from the scourge of war On Tuesday in justification of the US vote against the ceasefire call ThomasGreenfield said it was an inopportune time to demand that Israel end its massacre of Palestinians This raises the question of when the auspicious time will dawn for the US to support a ceasefire call Is the Biden administration arguably the most Zionistservile US administration waiting till the total annihilation of the Gaza population to support a ceasefire call The longer a ceasefire is delayed due to coldhearted US action the more Palestinian children women and civilians are killed not only in Israeli bombardment but also due to Israels use of starvation as a weapon of war and nonavailability of medicine Linda ThomasGreenfield said the ceasefire resolution proposed by Algeria would negatively impact ongoing negotiations for a truce Such inane excuses make little sense Instead they add credence to claims that the socalled American values that US presidents and diplomats boast about are only a deception to cover foreign policy immorality The immorality of Washingtons diehard support for Israel no matter how serious the Israeli war crimes are was also highlighted at the ongoing submissions at the International Court of Justice where its 15 judges are hearing a petition referred by the United Nations General Assembly seeking the courts advisory opinion on Israels occupation of Palestine On Monday appearing for Palestine at the World Court the wellknown US international lawyer Paul Reichler singled out the US for much of his critique saying that whatever violations of international law Israel commits the US always seeks to shield it from accountability Quoting from Barack Obamas 2020 memoirs he said US diplomats found themselves in the awkward position of having to defend Israel for actions we ourselves opposed Obama may not be a paragon of human rights virtues To call him so would be like plunging a long knife into the chests of thousands of innocent civilians killed by US drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan during his presidency But this is not our topic today Linda Thomas Greenfield did not seem to be in an awkward position when she raised her hand that killed Algerias resolution while the rest of the Security Council voted for it with the sole abstention being the United Kingdom A host of countries and human rights groups slammed the US for the use of the bloodlust veto But does it care In response Algerias UN ambassador Amar Bendjama said the US ambassadors lone vote against the resolution implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment inflicted upon Palestinians in Gaza We should ask ourselves How many innocent lives must be sacrificed before the council deems it necessary to call for a ceasefire She told the Security Council while the death toll soars over the 30000 mark This includes 13000 Gazan children The US proposed a rival draft calling for a temporary ceasefire and to add icing to the badly baked cake it included a clause opposing Israels impending strike on Rafah the southernmost Gaza city from where there is no escape for Palestinians from Israeli attacks except death The US diplomatic overdrive in defence of Israels genocide in Gaza was also evident in its opposition to the ICJ case on the question of the legality of Israels occupation of the Palestinian territory The World Court is hearing the case in consequence of the United Nations General Assembly passing a resolution on December 31 2022 Sri Lanka voted for the resolution which was passed with 87 countries supporting it 26 opposing it and 56 abstaining In its submission the US told the ICJ that it should not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories without security guarantees Citing the October 7 2023 Hamas attacks Richard Visek the acting legal adviser for the US State Department justified Israels occupation of the Palestinian territory on grounds of Israels security Absent in his submission is any mention of Israels numerous attacks since 1948 on Palestinians beginning with the Nakba The US is not nave not to know that security cannot be exclusively one states concern Yet as though the US is under the Zionist states satanic spell it refuses to recognise that Palestinians are also entitled to live in security The World Court may take months to deliver its nonbinding advisory opinion Israel will be sure to ignore the ruling if it is not in favour of it It will be a matter of serious interest to know how the US and Israels Western allies would react to such a ruling Meanwhile the worlds peace constituency is hailing Brazils President Lula da Silva after he called out Israel for emulating Hitlers holocaust The remark set off a diplomatic spat resulting in the titfortat expulsions of ambassadors Apart from Brazil also coming for praise are the countries that are making submissions to the ICJ in support of the Palestinian peoples right to statehood Among them was the South American nation of Guyana whose submission to the ICJ was outstanding for it was packed with solid facts irrefutable evidence and logically structured arguments Why Sri Lanka was not among the 50odd nations presenting submissions at the ICJ may raise a question about Sri Lankas commitment to the Palestinian cause The Sri Lankan government could trot out an excuse that it was more preoccupied with the economic crisis during that period than international political issues However the visit of Israels transport minister to Sri Lanka was illtimed and could be interpreted as an endorsement of Israels war crimes in Gaza Also the government cannot guarantee that the Sri Lankan labour being exported to Israel wont be used in Israels illegal settlementbuilding activities in occupied Palestinian land"

State Institutions professionals with a proven educational background He has also said during media interviews that Heads of certain State Institutions need both educational qualifications plus political acumen to deliver but academic qualifications would suffice if the subject matter is very technical like generating electricity If in the event the NPP forms a government it would surely attempt to rid the society of the caste and old school tie system that operates even now Then the new caste thatll occupy the decision making chairs in state institutes would be represented by the educated This is a change that would be embraced by career professionals but for that to happen there must be an election without delay A question that can be asked by far thinking people is how much of a change planned by the very ambitious NPP can be implemented If we turn the pages of time there were two groups which were clearly not involved in developing this nation by being involved with the work of past governments One is the private sector and the other is the JVP which is the key party marshalling the NPP The private sector preferred to mind its business and the JVP didnt wish to team

angle Ven Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera responded by stating Godahewa must be lauded for his publication because he has shared his knowledge with the people through a book at a time when educated people shy away from addressing the nation on national issues as independent critiques It must be stated that the JVP always stood as a firm critic of most governments and did so quite independently They didnt even side with the main opposition despite the fact that they were a minority party in the Parliament We need to analyse this JVP and see how it raised money for its activities and most importantly how its hierarchy lived quite luxuriously in recent years when most of its party members have had no steady income Now most of the top level decision makers of the JVP are in their 50s And maybe for the past 30 years these senior JVPers have survived each day pursuing a passion called leftist politics and also having to keep the home fires burning because these men folk wearing the red caps have had no worthwhile income For the JVP but not necessarily those in their alliance it has been a long wait for a political dream that may be realised soon or in other words a period of starvation sans power likely to see an end The Greens the Blues and later the Pohottuwa Party did extremely well in marketing poverty and the helplessness of the people The JVP marketed ushering in a corruption free disciplined nation The Reds have underscored time and again that whatever the programme the government initiated would raise the income of the worker Recently Dissanayake told the media that he was against any moves by the Government of Sri Lanka that would sell several of the islands dairies to Indias Amul Company However he has said that he visited India to convey to India

said that if Indias knowledge is implemented here our dairies would be able to give to farmers about 80 of the profits generated from the dairy business For that to happen our dairies would have to be run as cooperatives akin to how its done in India NPPs Dr Harini Amarasuriya is a politician belonging to the affluent society She had her first degrees in education from a local university and obtained higher qualifications from a foreign university She could be the first from this affluent society to work so closely with the JVP and its alliance and be successful in entering Parliament She probably understands that the rich or the affluent also have to bear some kind of sufferings in this life and its not only the less affluent whose lives revolve around extreme hardships This is an aspect common in life that the JVP must understand The NPP will do away with or give the least recognition to the subtle caste system that still operates discretely and has value in most societies It is certain that the NPP will spread its tentacles in the hot and humid northern and eastern provinces and also in the cold climes of the Central Province especially Nuwara Eliya The NPP Leader has spelt out plans to involve the private sector in the drive to rebuild this nation It is the private sector that has taught the hospitality trade here in this island and that the cold that the poor man cannot bear in Nuwara Eliya has a caste which is termed low however that same cold weather is marketed differently to affluent people as a luxury with invitations extended by proprietors to try out their holiday homes or circuit bungalows in Little England Its interesting to see how a future NPP regime and its leader would unite a workers world or a commoners world with a business community which till today has stayed clear of politics Vegetables are growing flowers are blossoming holiday homes are making money and the majority of the people are content in Nuwara Eliya and even sport smiling faces What have you to say to such a community Comrade Dissanayake"

presidential election constitutionally scheduled for this year not yet being officially declaredThe JVPled National Peoples Power NPP is engaging grassroots level individuals and organizations in view of the elections The early engagement is aimed at tailoring their electoral message effectively The party is channeling its energy into capitalising on the widespread dissatisfaction with traditional parties It is also projecting its latest Indian visit coupled with high profile enjoyments with top Indian leaders including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar as an international recognition of its rise to the zenith of Sri Lankan politics after the Aragalaya protests that forced former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of office in 2022 The NPP or the JVP for that matter maintains cohesion despite ideological clashes between its traditional members and newcomers Samagi Jana Balawegaya SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe are the two other prospective candidates The parties groups and organizations that intend to support them have launched into action ahead of the elections The formations of political alliances are in different stages at the moment and key among them is the revival of Peoples Alliance PA under its chair symbol reminiscent of the political transformation in 1994 when former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was elected to office as the President ending the 17year rule of the United National Party UNP She contested that election under the PAs chair symbol Although Kumaratunga doesnt wield electoral influence any longer she is known for her skills in carrying out political machinations and doing so behind the scenes She played a pivotal role in engineering the defection of former President Maithripala Sirisena from the then ruling side in 2014 a political exercise that ended the tenyear Mahinda Rajapaksa rule which was considered invincible up until then The PA is an alliance to be coled by her and Sirisena who is also the leader of Sri Lanka Freedom Party SLFP The political group led by Kurunegala district MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and organised by MP Nimal Lanza is likely to throw its weight behind the new alliance Then it becomes obvious that it is nothing but an alliance being formed to boost the candidacy of President Wickremesinghe The group is a faction that broke ranks with Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP and started identifying itself with the President right from the beginning The new alliance which is still in its formative stage has not declared formally what it will do at the presidential election Yet one cannot believe that it will support anyone other than the President The NPP is now not prepared to accommodate any other political party or individual The party has officially declared its stance on new additions The PA is also not accepting the SJB leadership Then it becomes clear that the President will be the preferred choice for them in view of the election Ahead of the formation of the alliance Sirisena also visited the United States However the President will launch into swift action in view of the elections in March only It is going to be a crucial month for the country under the Presidents leadership The government anticipates the possible signing of agreement with the creditors on debt restructuring next month along with some form of understanding with private bond holders If that happens as expected it will be a momentous occasion since the country will no longer be called bankrupt in the international arena afterwards Once resurrected from bankruptcy the countrys credit rating will improve The President and his camp see it as a plank on which the presidential election campaign can be launched Alongside the government is planning to announce some relief measures for people already suffering from the unprecedented cost of living and denial of economic opportunities in the midst of economic crisis The proposed electricity tariff reduction is also one of them If debt restructuring is achieved with the help of key countries such as India the United States China Japan France and the United Kingdom only the President and his government can stake a claim for it Still the President has to count on the SLPP as the key party to back him at the elections His electoral base will be that of the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa Rajapaksa will not harbour any political ambition for himself in the future due to age not being on his side Instead he is so concerned about the future of his son Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa who is aspiring to be the leader of the party and the country one day Currently Namal Rajapaksa appears to have started his political campaign with the primary aim of projecting himself as the next leader He is traversing across the country paying homage to leading Buddhist monks in addition to addressing the grassroots organizations of the party In case the SLPP backs the President at the presidential elections it will not be done without a favour in mind It will be an electoral arrangement that will secure the future of young Rajapaksa In politics nothing is impossible There are talks in progress on the need to scrap the Executive Presidency There is fear whether the government will try to postpone the Presidential Elections in the guise of enacting constitutional amendments to abolish Executive Presidency As things stand at the moment it is highly unlikely that the elections can be postponed whatsoever because public opinion is building against such a move Even the National Movement for Social Justice spearheaded by former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has initiated the discussion on the need to scrap Executive Presidency Yet it is against any move to postpone the elections under the pretext of it"

Prideful Legacy and Brotherhood This event is scheduled for March 2 and 3 while the 47th limited overs encounter is set for March 17 Both cricket matches are scheduled to take place at the Singhalese Sports Club SSC grounds marking a significantly new chapter in our shared legacy The ticket launch ceremony is scheduled today February 21 at the Kingsbury Colombo The last triumph in a Battle of the Maroons was achieved by Ananda in 2003 Conversely Nalanda secured its last victory in 2022 breaking a sixtynineyear drought Nalanda was established as an offshoot of Ananda in 1924 Ananda and Nalanda initiated the Big Match to foster camaraderie among students of both institutions and nurture their cricketing prowess The inaugural Battle of the Maroons unfolded in 1924 solidifying a longstanding

with both schools Over the decades a rich tradition was established and the cricketing competency of Ananda and Nalanda surpassed that of other schools in the country The Battle of the Maroons gradually transformed into a symbol of the unique brotherhood between the two schools standing out in a landscape where many schools aim to outshine each other During the war years of 1942 1943 1944 and 1945 no matches took place and in 1948 the Battle of the Maroons encounter was also skipped although the exact reason is not explicitly stated Additionally in 2021 the match wasnt played due to health reasons stemming from the Covid19 pandemic impact Since the 1970s the Battle of the Maroons has blossomed to become the most productive school cricket encounter in the island producing national cricketers of extraordinary talent and cricketing intellect Two of the most noteworthy cricketers the Maroons have produced that have brought glory to Sri Lanka Cricket are Bandula Warnapura of Nalanda who became the first Test captain and Arjuna Ranatunga of Ananda who captain of the World Cup winning team of 1996 This is only a glimpse of the contribution that the two schools have made to Sri Lanka Cricket as they continue to provide the largest contingent of players to the Sri Lankan National Cricket squad The Battle of the Maroons has further evolved into more than just a cricketing event it has become a display with immense commercial potential By introducing the concept of Sportainment we have created an architecture that optimises audience awareness and brand reach Audience reach is attracting more people and it is anticipated that over 15000 spectators this year with a broader audience reached through national and internal live feeds Further the entertainment tents have a highend designation featuring celebrities ensuring continuous hype throughout the event In addition social media presence is extended on various social media platforms providing an extended reach before and after the main events The Big Matches are also known as March Madness as they are usually held at the end of the first school term in March The Big Matches provide competition among schools and it also serves as a meeting place for many old boys This is an annual calendar event that is looked forward to between rival schools in Sri Lanka These schools have been playing against one another for many years some for over a century The Big Matches have become an important part of modern Sri Lankan culture with both schoolchildren and adults taking part in the activity Our annual match draws excitement from all walks of life spanning generations genders and even those unaffiliated with either school The event is a festive occasion where both old and present students come together for joyous celebrations Its common to witness elderly alumni from both schools at the Big Match relishing the chance to stroll down memory lane and reconnect with old friends at the Brothers Tent In Colombo several notable encounters have set the traditions The Battle of the Blues between Royal College Colombo and S Thomas College Mount Lavinia began in 1879 and reached its 144th encounter in 2023 Other iconic matches include the Battle of the Saints the Battle of the Golds in Moratuwa despite there being occasional disruptions in this encounter The Battle of the Brothers and the youngest of them all the Battle of the Golds in Colombo involving D S Senanayake College and Mahanama College which started in 2007 marked its 17th edition in 2023 Each encounter is a testament to the longstanding traditions and the shared passion for cricket among the schools The rich history of these encounters showcases the enduring spirit of competition and camaraderie In the current year 2024 the Joint Organizing Committee for the Battle of the Maroons has been restructured featuring many eminent old boys from both schools since it was founded in 2009 This committee continues the tradition of jointly organising the annual cricketing encounter exemplifying the brotherhood between Ananda and Nalanda AnandaNalanda Teams in 1926 In a significant development in 2024 in the Battle of the Maroons history the joint organizing committee underwent this restructuring aligning with the Ministry of Educations directive In this process the Logo was also redesigned and launched on January 10 2024 The Principals played a crucial role in shaping the future trajectory of the collective joint efforts leading to a comprehensive restructuring The initiative aims to showcase a collective dedication to excellence adaptability and continuous improvement Changes in the incumbent positions reflected a forwardthinking approach bringing fresh perspectives to the forefront and involving the younger generation specifically school prefects in organising the match to boost their confidence and leadership traits Acknowledging the challenges of the change the Battle of the Maroons joint committee firmly believes that the restructuring is a positive step toward a stronger and more agile joint organization in the spirit of joint brotherhood Appreciation is extended to the dedication and diligence of each member of the previous joint committees since its inception in 2009 acknowledging their value addition The Golden Jubilee Battle of the Maroons A Significant milestone marked the 50th Battle of the Maroons and was played at The Oval Then known as the P Sarawanamuttu Stadium on March 24th and 25th in1979 The preparations kicked off well in advance The first engagement featured a match between the prefects of each school followed by a game among the teachers at Campbell Place and the enchanting Nalanda cycle parade Ananda was led by the stylish Thilan

        "body": "Protesting trade unions demanded a hike in their allowances commensurate to the increase of the doctors If you want to see the residual of feudalism alive and kicking in this country look no further than the health sector Deputy Director of the Colombo National Hospital Rukshan Bellana became the unannointed spokesman of the condescendingly lowly status the doctors hold the support staff in the profession This may not be the uniform stance where individual interactions are concerned Still it appears to be a defacto official position if you are to survey the Government Medical Officers Associations GMOA reaction towards nurses midwives paramedics and other support staff Strangely for a band of professionals whose elevated position owes so much to the public funded university education without which many would not have achieved more than Paramedics or lab technicians whom they now look down from their pedestals doctors unions in this country have regularly opposed the career development of other affiliated services if they even remotely threaten the status of doctors Dr Belllana put this innate condescension on public display last week when he disparaged the support staff in the health sector which had launched a trade union action over the disparities in the pay scale after the government unilaterally increased the Disturbance Availability Transport allowance for doctors by 35000 rupees Protesting trade unions demanded a hike in their allowances commensurate to the increase of the doctors Bellana unleashed a tirade at the support staff describing them as those who push trolleys and clean toilets and saying that hospitals can carry on without their service Earlier Bellana and other GMOA spokespersons sounded out the doctors special status Office assistants of companies cannot ask for the luxuries of the CEOs one quipped This time around Bellana struck a raw nerve Support staff laid siege to his office He was evacuated from a back door but the trade unions demanded his removal from the Hospital The Health Minister has promised an inquiry Dr Bellana has retorted he would resign if he is removed This is not an isolated incident Earlier a doctor at Kapapitiya hospital was charged with assaulting support staff This is not a problem with individuals ask how our doctors conduct themselves during their training in the UK or Australia This is a problem with the structure The system itself fosters that last residue of feudalism How Did We Get Here The publicly funded healthcare system in Sri Lanka is a gem of its welfare state and is universally acclaimed for its costeffective superior performance This free universal health care system was not exactly a Sri Lankan innovation the colonial government founded it in line with the British welfare reforms introduced by the Labour government in 1945 which introduced a cradle to grave welfare state Similarly CWW Kannangaras Free Education Act was enabled by a similar Free Secondary Education Act passed in the UK in 1944 After independence from Britain successive leaders adopted the welfare state some out of conviction some not so much But for all winning political office and survival in the office was conditioned on the continuation of the welfare state However over time as populism and quasiMarxism infested the system the welfare state became an utmost state monopoly which actively excluded private investment State monopoly meant smaller intakes of the medical service to the universities and anywhere else where the countrys youth aspire for upward mobility This allencompassing state monopoly is the primary cause of Sri Lankas subpar economic performance However the world has changed since then but in Sri Lanka those who climbed up the ladder in this statist system have opposed every effort to open it up Doctors and medical students have forced the government to shut down private medical colleges Engineering students had fought street fights with their less fortunate peers in NDT courses when the latter was elevated to degree status Publicfunded university education is a case of the misallocation of limited tax money for the betterment of a few at the expense of the vast majority Worse still in Sri Lanka the system operates to the exclusion of others who could not attend a public university It also dissuades private investment in higher education Though I myself am a beneficiary of this system in retrospect the same system has cannibalized the future of around 8090 per cent of students in my cohort Things have improved since then but visceral selfish interests to exclude most youth from achieving their dreams persist As a result the system produces a large standing army of threewheel drivers housemaids and unskilled labourers for the Middle East and Korea That is a shame Similarly it has fostered a fortress of feudal entitlement as seen in the professional classes This results from unofficial supply caps enforced on higher professions in isolation from the market forces which otherwise could have brought an equilibrium Then the good fellows threaten to migrate when their special privileges are not accorded How to Dismantle the Vestige of Feudalism Mao Zedong unleashed the cultural revolution and red guards smashed the old ostensibly to destroy the last vestige of feudalism Gandhi preached nonviolence But if anyone it was Deng Xiaoping who conclusively destroyed feudalism in China with his adoption of free market policies Capitalism is the most potent weapon to destroy feudalism Yet for a country that had seen its competitive advantage slipping away under state monopoly Sri Lankans are still fooled by the same old culprits who have a habit of blaming the market forces for all the countrys shortcomings In fact it was the lack of economic liberalism that contributed to much of the countrys economic underperformance and empowered a few at the expense of the vast majority of people For Sri Lanka to break the remnant of feudalism in the medical sector it should promote private medical schools and provide pathways for the career advancement of nurses and paramedics just like in other countries and let the market forces create an equilibrium of supply and demand The same applies to tertiary education at large where privatepublic investment should be the primary driver to provide higher education opportunities to 75 per cent of the students of each cohort who could not attend a public university Expanded and modernized tertiary education supported by tuition fee loans should be the primary pillar of strength if Sri Lankan youth are to achieve their full potential Feudalism in the health sector is a symptom of a bigger malady that besets the country at large The treatment for it is universally known except that successive governments have suffered from a chronic deficit of political will Follow RangaJayasuriya on X"

its traditional objection to the public practice of other religions especially idol worship On February 14 Abu Dhabi heralded a new era of religious accommodation by allowing Hindus a very large community of expatriates from India to build a grand temple Significantly the land for it was donated by the UAE government This could well be a harbinger of religious tolerance in Muslimmajority West Asia A few Hindu temples had come up in the past with one even dating back to 1817 but the newest and the grandest of them all is the one which was consecrated on February 14 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Abu Dhabi a constituent of the UAE The UAE has 35 million Indians the majority of whom are Hindus Indian immigrants who make up 30 of the UAEs population are the single largest ethnic community in the UAE The temple built by the century old Gujaratbased organization the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha BAPS It is a massive structure with seven spires to represent the seven constituents of the UAE The temple was built at a cost of about US 95 million by BAPS It was built on 27 acres 11 hectares of land gifted by the UAE government The fact that the land had been donated by an Islamic country is very significant since it shows that the cosmopolitan UAE is proceeding full throttle towards becoming a pluralistic society which has room for all This temple is a symbol of the shared heritage of humanity It is a symbol of the mutual love between the Indian and Arab people It reflects the philosophical connection between India and the UAE Modi said to a crowd waving UAE and Indian flags Accompanied by Hindu religious leaders and priests Modi offered prayers and performed rituals as he toured the temple The grand event was attended by members of the UAE government Bollywood stars and the local Indian community Significantly Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan the UAE Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence joined Prime Minister Modi as the presiding priest of the temple Mahant Swami Maharaj consecrated the temple It was in February 2018 that the UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan granted the land to Modi who in turn tapped BAPS to design the new temple The result is a structure made of Indian sandstone covered in carved Italian marble Inclusivity Exhibited The stone carvings feature motifs from both Indian and Arab cultures including Indian elephants and mangoes and Arabian camels and dates Another aspect of inclusivity was the fact that the UAE government identified the projects chief architect as a Christian and other key personnel as Buddhist Sikh Jain Zoroastrian and atheist It was a multireligious cooperative venture The temples Dome of Harmony a companion to its Dome of Peace was designed and donated by a Muslim architect For the first year after the temples opening the Prasad the sanctified food offered to visitors will be provided by a Muslim vendor Knox Thames a former special adviser for Near Eastern and South Asian Religious Minorities at the US Department of State said the new temple in Abu Dhabi is part of a decadeslong trend of the UAEs efforts to accommodate the spiritual and religious needs of the millions of expatriates who are working in the country Not the First in UAE However the BAPS temple is not the first Hindu temple in the Gulf The Shrinathji Temple in Bahrain at Manama dedicated to Lord Krishna in the form of a 7year old child has been in existence since 1817 It was constructed by the Thattai Hindu community from Sindh which is now a province of Pakistan The Thattais are Sindhi traders Dubai has a Hindu cum Sikh temple in existence since 1958 at Bur Dubai This temple has shrines dedicated to Shiva and Krishna and also a Sikh temple called the Gurudwara In October 2022 the Shiva temple and the Gurudwara were relocated in a new Hindu temple built at Jebel Ali But the Krishna shrine was retained in Bur Dubai The temple in Dubai came into existence after the then ruler Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum permitted its promoters to use the first floor of a building housing shops in Bur Dubai The walls were made sound proof as per government laws The new temple which came up in Jebel Ali in October 2022 was built at a cost of 60 million Dirhams US 163 million The architecture is a fusion of Indian and Arabic styles The temple was built using 900 tonnes of steel 6000 cubic metres of concrete and 1500 square metres of marble The Motishwar temple is a Shiva temple complex located near the Al Alam Palace in the Muttrah area of Old Muscat in Oman It is one of the oldest Hindu temples in the Middle East The temple celebrates numerous Hindu festivals such as Vasant Panchmi Ramnavmi Hanuman Jayanti Shravan and Ganesh Chathurthi Over 20000 Hindus visit the temple during Maha Shivaratri It was built between 1892 and 1909 by the Bhatia community of Sindh now in Pakistan The Bhatias first set foot on Muscat in 1507 as traders and have remained there since The Motishwar complex contains three temples Shri Adi Motishwar Mahadev temple Shri Motishwar Mahadev temple and Shri Hanumanji temple Although Muscat is a desert the temples well has water throughout the year Indian Prime Minister Modi visited it on 12 February 2018 during his state visit to Oman Last year UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan opened the Abrahamic Family House a complex in Abu Dhabi that includes a Christian church a synagogue and a mosque all facing a planted plaza It is indeed remarkable for an Arab country to accommodate a synagogue despite the centuriesold ArabJewish conflict in the Middle East According to wwwmemriorg while Islamic radical clerics in West Asia criticised the permission given to the BAPS Abu Dhabi temple especially when the Hindu nationalist government in India is accused of being hostile to Muslims liberal Muslims stressed that the temple reflects the UAEs efforts to promote peace coexistence and tolerance On October 6 2022 on the building of a temple in Dubai Emirati Twitter user Sir Ahmed wrote Respecting the religions of our partners in development is a fundamental principle in the UAE Our tolerance is a seed that was planted by Sheikh Zayed Our coexistence is the fruit of that planting Egyptian film creator artist and YouTuber Sherif Gaber praised the building of the Dubai temple in a tweet that he

        "body": "Media reports state that the government is considering the abolition of the Executive Presidency instead of holding the next Presidential election which is constitutionally scheduled to be conducted later this year between September 18 and October 18 One website quoted former President Maithripala Sirisena as stating that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has tasked a group of lawyers with looking into the abolition of the Executive Presidency According to the report the former President speaking at an event in Wennappuwa on February 11th had said that the group of lawyers is led in this move by former Speaker and the head of the National Movement for a Just Society Karu Jayasuriya However the Presidential Secretariat recently issued a statement claiming that the Presidential election would be held according to the law Though the statement came following the claim made by the former President it did not specifically deny it Nevertheless the President had told a group of MPs according to media reports that there would be no abolition of the Executive Presidency at this time Given the recent turn of events nobody can give any assurance on anything about politics in Sri Lanka The law seems to be full of loopholes President Wickremesinghe told Parliament on February 23 last year that the local government elections had not been legally announced even after his party the United National Party UNP had tendered nominations for the same Despite the Supreme Court having ordered the Finance Ministry Secretary not to withhold funds allocated for the local government elections the Ministry did not issue funds for that purpose Hence both the possibilities of holding of the Presidential election as well as taking measures to abolish the Executive Presidency cannot be ruled out The history of attempts to do away with the Executive Presidency has sufficiently proved the hypocrisy of almost all political parties that were in power Anyway the idea has been very popular since the Executive Presidency was introduced in October 1977 through the Second Amendment to the First Republican Constitution of 1972 The first regime change in 1994 after it was brought in was a success mainly due to the promise by Chandrika Kumaratunga to abolish it and she had interestingly fixed a deadline as well July 15 1995 even without her party the Peoples Alliance PA having the required two thirds majority in Parliament The UNP on the completion of two years after that deadline on July 15 1997 launched a massive demonstration in Colombo demanding that Kumaratungas promise be kept But the government set the police and the goons against the demonstrators and even against the media The scrapping of the Executive Presidency was the primary pledge by the PAs next Presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa as well in 2005 and he too had the convenient excuse of lack of specified majority in Parliament not to keep his promise The irony played its utmost after the next Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 2010 where Mahinda Rajapaksa obtained the much awaited two thirds majority but he used it to strengthen the Executive Presidency through the 18th Amendment to the Constitution instead of doing away with it Next in line were Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe who rode mainly on ridding the Presidential mode of governance and the eradication of corruption at the 2015 Presidential election However they were facilitated by a legal point later that a referendum is needed to keep the first promise and therefore they accordingly reformed the Executive Presidency with the 19th Amendment This legal point was again reiterated by the Supreme Court when the SJB presented the 21st Amendment to scrap the Executive Presidency in 2022 Then why should one ignore this legal point before batting around scrapping the current mode of governance now If the authorities say yes to a referendum they have to justify the rationale and morality of spending Rs10 billion for it at a time when there is a dearth of lifesaving medicines in government hospitals Hence although the government might seem to make an attempt to abolish the Executive Presidency it would be nothing but creating confusion among the masses to postpone for the moment the Presidential election which seems to be highly unfavourable to the two parties in the government"

        "body": "President Wickremesinghe is aware that in 2018 the Supreme Court in a seven bench decision decided that former President Sirisena had acted arbitrarily and unconstitutionally by dissolving Parliament prematurely Consequently Wickremesinghe was restored to the office of Prime Minister Therefore it is evident that the President cannot seek unquestioning loyalty to himself from all public officials and institutions in the exercise of what he personally considers are his powers and responsibilities Since 1972 this country has known no Monarch and the President has not inherited that mantle All his powers are limited by the provisions of the Constitution Dissolution of Parliament Case 2018 The Friday Forum an informal group of concerned citizens pledged to uphold the norms of Democracy Good Governance the Rule of Law Human Rights Media Freedom and Tolerance raised concerns on the Presidential Secretariats interpretation of Presidential powers In a statement issued the Forum sheds light on a public document released by the Presidents Media Division PMD on January 31 This document indicates that it is meant to be the Secretariats interpretation of the Presidents powers under our Constitution Just before the PMD release the Online Safety Bill was signed into law by the Speaker This Bill was brought to Parliament after the Determination of the Supreme Court which required 31 amendments The OSA was a very controversial piece of legislation criticized by civil society local experts international organizations and tech companies They expressed grave concerns on its detrimental impact on the democratic and fundamental rights of the people The Speaker ignored calls by the Opposition for more time to debate the Bill in Parliament and ensure that it complied with the amendments that the Court had determined as essential for this bill to be legal The Opposition had pointed out that compliance was essential to ensure the OSA was a valid law according to our Constitution The Speakers actions have resulted in the OSA Act becoming the law of the country with no assurance that it conforms to the Supreme Court determination and the Constitution This is unprecedented in Parliamentary procedures We now have a law of which the legality is doubtful Both these developments indicate a growing trend towards authoritarian governance disregarding the Constitution and the democratic rights of the people The Friday Forum draws attention to some matters which clarify that the misleading media release of the Presidential Secretariat published with the Presidents approval must be challenged and rejected a Under our Constitution only the Supreme Court can interpret the Constitution The President and the Presidential Secretariat have no role and authority in this regard b For 76 years the courts and their independence from the Executive and Parliament through a constitutional system of checks and balances has been a foundational value in governance in Sri Lanka and is recognized in the 1978 Constitution That concept has not been eliminated by 21 later amendments to this Constitution It is reflected in the postindependence jurisprudence of the Superior Courts of the country especially the apex Supreme Court c The document indicates that the President is empowered to exercise all powers under the Constitution at the Presidents sole discretion No public institution including the courts and the Constitutional Council on High Post Appointments have a right to place any obstacles to the exercising of Presidential powers If the President is deemed to have acted unconstitutionally by exceeding his powers the constitution provides a procedure to address this The incumbent President has taken an oath of office as the Executive and also as a lawyer to be guided by the Constitution of the country in all his actions This PMD document suggests that he can disregard the Constitution if he thinks that this is best for the country The fact that he is challenging the Opposition in Parliament to respond perhaps with an Impeachment Motion is indicative of his confidence in his Parliamentary majority that will as in the past raise their hands in support of him with mindless loyalty whatever the consequences for the country d The Supreme Court has indicated in many judgements in the last decades that public office must be held in public trust and official powers must be exercised within the framework of the law and the Constitution This has been reiterated in several recent cases including the case on the economic crisis and the fundamental rights of the people President Wickremesinghe is aware that in 2018 the Supreme Court in a seven bench decision decided that former President Sirisena had acted arbitrarily and unconstitutionally by dissolving Parliament prematurely Consequently Wickremesinghe was restored to the office of Prime Minister Therefore it is evident that the President cannot seek unquestioning loyalty to himself from all public officials and institutions in the exercise of what he personally considers are his powers and responsibilities e The Constitutional Council CC is not an executive body It has been empowered by the Constitution to scrutinize Presidential nominees and to approve them to high posts This has been reiterated in the 21st Amendment that President Wickremesinghe himself initiated The Constitutional Council rejecting a nominee cannot be considered an obstacle to the exercise of Presidential power The PMD document challenging the Opposition to impeach the President if he abuses power demonstrates the manner in which in the post war years this office has been transformed into something even worse than the powerful Executive Presidency originally created by the 1978 constitution President Wickremesinghe is clearly seeking to carry this office to an even higher level of an authoritarian dictatorship with the justification of having to seek solutions to national bankruptcy The time has come for us as citizens to demand that the abolition of the Executive Presidency is realized as a matter of urgency in 2024 It is a toxic model of governance that has damaged public institutions All the major political parties in this country made this promise and never fulfilled it All Presidents who came to office except former President Chandrika Kumaranatunga failed the nation in this regard the draft constitution of 2000 which President Kumaratungas government presented providing for the abolition of the Executive Presidency could not be adopted by Parliament due to the conduct of the then Opposition Leader who is the current President of the country He and his UNP rejected the proposed constitution and tore the document during the debate in Parliament The disagreement was not in regard to the text of the draft constitution but a provision on who would head the new government It is classic irony that 24 years later Mr Wickremesinghe is trying to strengthen the Executive Presidency and transform it into a political dictatorship beyond the limits of the Constitution His rationale appears to be his personal vision or Idiri Dekma or what he thinks is best for the country Is this a new articulation of another Executive Presidents Vistas of Prosperity The events of recent weeks in 2024 and our national economic and governance crisis must convince us as citizens to call for an affirmation by all parties and their leaders that they will abolish the Executive Presidency and go back to a system of an elected Prime Minister responsible to Parliament and the people Let us call for a referendum on this matter that is combined with the first election held in 2024 Contributions to this article

        "body": "The movement to abolish the Executive Presidency is gaining traction and drawing significant interest as the deadline approaches A prudent suggestion is to abolish the Executive Presidency through a referendum ensuring that the process is not driven by ulterior motives An alternative approach could involve the immediate dissolution of Parliament after securing the necessary twothirds majority Following this a twoinone approach can be adopted by combining the referendum with the Parliamentary elections streamlining the process and saving time manpower and financial resources In the book A Critical Analysis of the New Constitution of the Sri Lanka Government authored in Sri Lanka and published two years after the 1978 Constitution legendary leftist intellectual Dr NM Perera offers a critical examination of the illeffects of the Executive Presidency and forecasts future political and constitutional realities Though these failures were not evident during his time Perera scrutinizes the character of the Executive Presidency in the 5th chapter In eight subsequent chapters he delves into the detailed discussion of how the Executive Presidency could control the entire structure including Parliament the Prime Minister the Cabinet of Ministers the Judiciary and the election process to maintain authoritarian powers Dr N M Perera who obtained two doctorates PhD and DSc for thesis based on Comparative Constitutional Reforms and Parliamentary Procedure discussed the adverse repercussions of establishing an Executive Presidency He emphasized the necessity for checks and balances in a countrys constitution considering diversities and aiming for the highest common accord Dr Perera foresaw potential conflicts between a leftofcenter Parliament and a rightinclined Executive especially in a scenario where the President appoints the Prime Minister from among the members The proposal includes adopting a Frenchstyle system to prevent MPs from changing affiliations The emphasis is on constitutional changes for improvement The call is for stakeholders including political parties clergy civil society media and citizens to thoroughly examine the issue without succumbing to parties seeking full control of the House Concerns revolve around the decline in disciplinary standards and the irresponsible conduct of Parliament over the past five decades Leaders need followers so good communication skills charisma and friendliness are essential traits Addressing the possibility of a President and Prime Minister from rival parties being compelled to form a cohabitation Dr Perera pointed out the Constitutions failure to anticipate this undesirable feature He highlighted the Presidents power to take over functions assigned to the Prime Minister or any Minister leading to conflicts with declared policies This he argued could result in a deadlock bringing the entire governmental machinery to a standstill If this fails a leader selection would come up in seven months people should look beyond political debates Its wise to assess candidates based on their proven leadership qualities Choosing a leader based on these factors is vital for the nations progress and prosperity Effective leaders have a clear vision they passionately believe in Leadership is about inspiring a group to work together for a common goal The leaders vision and instructions guide their team whether its ministers or military commanders Leadership is about bringing people with different opinions together to work towards common goals It involves giving team members the authority to do their tasks but the leader always bears the responsibility for the outcomes whether they are successful or not Pros and Cons of Retaining the Executive Presidency The movement to abolish the Executive Presidency is gaining traction and drawing significant interest as the deadline approaches J R Jayewardene the key figure behind the creation of the Executive Presidency expressed the significance of such a system for Sri Lanka in 1966 when he served as the Minister of State He emphasized that a robust Executive holding power for a specific term and not subject to the whims of an elected Legislature would be unafraid to make correct but unpopular decisions The 1978 Constitution marked a significant shift by consolidating the powers of both the Legislative and Executive branches into one distinct person This departure from the Westminster form of governance which separated the roles of the Head of State the President and the Head of Government the Prime Minister was a noteworthy change in the countrys governance structure Jayewardene perhaps foreseeing challenges in the rising rates of crimes thefts burglary alcoholism illicit breweries and rape considered them as grave problems hindering economic development He believed a strong and stable administration under an Executive President was crucial especially in addressing the demands of an open economy an idea he had contemplated for a long time The 1947 Soulbury Commissionrecommended Constitution entrusted Executive authority to the GovernorGeneral chosen by the Crown The Cabinet led by the Prime Minister and appointments to the Supreme Court and Public Service Commission were made by the GovernorGeneral promoting transparency and reducing nepotism However the 1978 constitution changed this with the President directly elected by the people leading to concerns about external influence infringing on peoples sovereignty Addressing the possibility of a President and Prime Minister from rival parties being compelled to form a cohabitation Dr Perera pointed out the Constitutions failure to anticipate this undesirable feature He highlighted the Presidents power to take over functions assigned to the Prime Minister or any Minister leading to conflicts with declared policies This he argued could result in a deadlock bringing the entire governmental machinery to a standstill JR Jayewardene reiterated his support for the concept while addressing the position at the Constituent Assembly in 1972 stating An Executive President duly elected for a specific term would not be susceptible to the unpredictable shifts of political forces in the Legislature To support his stance he cited the example of Sirimavo Bandaranaikes democratically elected government being ousted in 1964 This removal resulted from external pressures acting through Parliament ultimately depriving her of a Parliamentary majority Speaking on the proposed 1978 Constitution Dr NM Perera questioned the expedited approach highlighting that most countries with written Constitutions undergo a careful and timeconsuming amendment process often taking years and sometimes involving referendums Dr NM Perera emphasized the importance of allowing diverse views on the Presidential system of government to be communicated to the Parliament and the people advocating for thorough consideration to be given to various perspectives Continuing his critique Dr NM Perera pointed to the experiences of other countries with Presidential systems citing coups and subsequent political and economic challenges faced by those nations Dr Perera cautioned against blindly venturing into this uncertain gamble and potentially discarding fifty years of parliamentary democracy which despite its flaws had provided a level of stability and progress When JR Jayewardene suggested to Sirimavos twothirds Parliamentary power 197077 to introduce an Executive Presidency Dr NM Perera and Dr Colvin R De Silva both Ministers in the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government vehemently opposed the idea They saw it as a threat to democracy concentrating power in the hands of one individual Despite their opposition J R Jayewardenes government introduced the Executive Presidency in 1978 granting the President substantial powers to make decisions without parliamentary approval Dr N M Perera and Dr Colvin R De Silva argued that this departure from the traditional Westminsterstyle Parliamentary system in Sri Lanka would lead to authoritarianism undermining democratic values and institutions

        "body": "Sri Lanka is described as a multilingual country but this definition could perhaps be deceptive when reflecting on the past and present One may be quick to point fingers at various state policies that were implemented which made one language superior to the rest However language is an integral part of communication and is a key marker of identity Sri Lanka witnessed a time when minority groups faced linguistic discrimination which in fact was a political recipe for disaster As the world prepares to celebrate International Mother Language Day on February 21 it would be timely to reflect on the mistakes that dragged Sri Lanka towards ethnic separatism During colonial rule a largely nonEnglish speaking population was governed by a small group of Englishspeaking elite From the end of the 18th Century until Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948 English was the dominant language in government Therefore those who could speak English had better access to jobs and a higher standard of living It was in this backdrop that the Swabasha Movement began even before Sri Lanka gained independence as Sri Lankans felt oppressed under the privilege and elitism of the Englishspeaking community This movement served as the public cry to make Sinhala and Tamil the official languages of Sri Lanka The British gradually included Sinhalese and Tamils in decisionmaking positions But as more Tamilspeaking people assumed key positions in government service the Sri Lanka Freedom Party advocated for the official language to be Sinhala only In 1956 when Oxford educated SWRD Bandaranaike became Prime Minister he decided to bring in the Official Language Policy of 1956 popularly known as the Sinhala Only Act The Act stated that The Sinhala language will be the one official language of Ceylon Many cite this Act as the root cause of the 30year ethnic war Even though the current Constitution recognizes Sinhala and Tamil as official languages and English as the link language the damage is irreversible But contrary to a time when Tamilspeaking people in the country were discouraged from entering public service as a result of the Sinhala Only Act public officers are now being paid an allowance if they are proficient in more than one language The International Mother Language Day first proclaimed by UNESCO and later adopted by the UN General Assembly underscores the role of languages in promoting inclusion and achieving Sustainable Development Goals Multilingual education policies highlighted in the 2024 theme Multilingual Education A Pillar of Learning and Intergenerational Learning are crucial for inclusive education and the preservation of indigenous languages Multilingual and multicultural societies exist through their languages which transmit and preserve traditional knowledge and cultures in a sustainable way Contrary to Sri Lanka the European Parliament for instance has adopted a full multilingual language policy meaning that all EU languages are equally important All parliamentary documents are translated into all the official languages and every Member of the European Parliament has the right to speak in the language of his or her choice The European Education system ensures that children are proficient in at least two foreign languages The system of the European Schools is a multilingual environment Pupils in European Schools should acquire the linguistic repertoire which is recommended to any European citizen by the end of hisher secondary studies A pupil from a family where the parents share the same dominant language can usually speak a standard national language often accompanied by a regional or minority variety and at least two foreign languages at a later stage Perhaps if history could be reversed and if a multilingual language policy was introduced back in 1956 in place of a shortsighted act with vested interests there wouldnt have been a 30year ethnic war a mass exodus of the Tamilspeaking community at the time and people of all ethnicities would have had equal opportunities within the boundaries of their homeland There wouldnt have been any space left for discrimination Matteroffactly Truth Justice Reconciliation and National Unity would have been established long years ago"

        "body": "The consequence for the developing countries with high levels of debt is a prolonged development crisis with capital extracted for debt repayments and little capital left for investment to stimulate growth Two years ago in February 2022 Sri Lanka rapidly descended into an economic crisis that had long been in the making The war in Ukraine and the sudden escalation of global commodity prices made it very difficult to import essential goods such as fuel Having exhausted its foreign reserves without prioritising the imports of essential goods the government defaulted on its external debt two months later Many neoliberal economists who saw the IMF as the final solution had begun calling in late 2021 for a default on the countrys external debt claiming that a quick agreement with the IMF bridge financing from donors and a rapid debt restructuring process would solve Sri Lankas economic problems Some of us including Devaka Gunawardena and I wrote that a default will be crippling and that we should prioritise and reduce imports and forestall a default The then ruling regime shuffled the high officials including the Finance Minister the Secretary to the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank Governor And within weeks of a new Minister and officials assuming office and egged on by President Gotabaya Rajapaksas advisors they announced the default in April 2022 However their stated objectives did not materialise there was no new bridge financing the IMF agreement took another year and debt restructuring is yet to be achieved The 17th IMF agreement that Sri Lanka signed is now devastating our working people with austerity measures Unlike earlier IMF agreements this time the IMF has a choke hold on the country because normalising the countrys external finances after default requires the IMFs role as the arbiter for debt restructuring Will this IMF solution work and what hidden agendas does it serve Hegemonic Debt Narratives Two years ago the Western establishment was worried about the possibilities of a domino of defaults needing extensive debt restructuring Indeed even nuclear powers like Pakistan were considered to be on the verge of default The hegemonic narrative today is going through change the insolvency crisis inability to repay debt is now being constructed as a liquidity crisis lack of shortterm funds to make debt payments It is claimed that if there is sufficient sloshing of funds including new loans to such debtridden countries then debt restructuring will not be necessary This shift in the global construction of the debt problems as one of liquidity rather than insolvency serves the interests of the powerful creditors who need not consider any form of debt cancellation or even reduction but can continue happily with their accumulation of the current state of high interest rates The consequence for the developing countries with high levels of debt is a prolonged development crisis with capital extracted for debt repayments and little capital left for investment to stimulate growth In this context the countries that avoided default at all costs have some flexibility in charting their economic policies This raises questions about the prudence of the Sri Lankan officials advisors and thinktanks that called for default How does one consider the public gleefulness of these officials and socalled experts when Sri Lanka defaulted and how can one even consider their economic advice today Sri Lankas default has trapped the country into the clutches of the IMF and made it now a guinea pig for experimentation for the next phase of debt restructuring mechanisms amidst geopolitical manoeuvres prioritising global financial accumulation The vultures of global financiers International Financial Institutions Western Powers and the Asian Giants at loggerheads are all seeking their own interests with little care for the suffering of the people in Sri Lanka Dispossession as Solution With the debt problems in the Global South now pushed towards a fix absorbed through a long development crisis what are the hidden dynamics of the problematic solution for the debt crisis in Sri Lanka This has been one of the central questions of the work I have undertaken with my fellow researchers Madhulika Gunawardena Shafiya Rafaithu Sinthuja Sritharan and Yathursha Ulakentheran We analyse the IMF programme as articulated in its agreement as unsustainable Indeed the IMFs debt sustainability analysis itself states Even after a successful program and debt restructuring debt risks will remain high for many years IMF Agreement March 2023 We see three scenarios going forward Firstly the IMF programme as stated is taken forward continuing with economic contraction which results in another default following a creditorfriendly debt restructuring process with little debt relief as well as another IMF agreement after a few years and thus prolonged and repeated debt crises Secondly in the event that a new leadership in Sri Lanka tears up the IMF agreement and refuses to repay the debt the country would then sail into choppy global waters where its future will also be determined by developments in other countries affected by debt crises and the possibility of a new global financial architecture Thirdly it is the scenario of the unsaid and hidden solution underway now of a fire sale of public assets tremendous wage repression ensuring profitability for local businesses along with increased competitiveness in export markets and the fix of austerity absorbed by working peoples households Our economic analysis focuses on the third hidden and cynical solution The privatisation of public assets kills two birds with one stone for the regime When foreign investors come and pick up our utilities for example it brings in both foreign exchange to repay dollar denominated external debt and also addresses the short fall in revenue necessary to stay on the course of the IMF programme Next wage repression where real wages have halved are ensuring local businesses to continue to make profits Furthermore even with unstable global markets Sri Lankas foreign earnings are keeping the country afloat Indeed contrary to the claim of an IMF bailout which only brings in an average of US 60 million a month Sri Lankas export earnings of US 1000 million a month are crucial for meeting the import bill The most worrying aspect of the solution is the manner in which the fix for the national debt crisis is displaced to the level of the working peoples households And here it is women who have to face the challenges of household finances including to provision essentials and struggle with the wellbeing of their children and dependants In other words in our feminist economic analysis whether it is market pricing of energy leading to the increased electricity bill for their houses and increased bus fares of their schoolgoing children or the consequence of the price hikes of imported foods from milk powder to wheat flour or managing the household with lowered incomes through daily wage due to lack of work all of these pressures fall on the lap of women The cunning of capital masked in this case by the IMF programme and its debt restructuring process seeks to displace crisis with socalled solutions which ensure capitalist accumulation while the working people bear the entire cost In the above hidden solution indeed the three dimensions of the sale of public assets that further dispossess the working people of public services the reduced wages and the crippling absorption of the crisis in the home with hunger are related What should the working people demand during this election year From a solution that seeks to fix the crisis through austere homes should we not demand solutions that redistribute wealth at the national level and debt cancellation at the global level"

not care a hoot about the Tamil media I have also come across many Sinhalese who were extremely concerned about what appeared in the Tamil newspapers Upali belonged to the latter group Though he could not read Tamil he got his Tamil employees at the Upali Group to inform him about what was appearing in the Virakesari Today Feb 17 is the birthday of Sri Lankas popular business magnate Philip Upali Wijewardene If Upali Wijewardene were among the living now he would have celebrated his 86th birthday this year Alas this was not to be as the Lear Jet he was travelling in disappeared on 13 February 1983 just 4 days before his 45th birthday It was my privilege to be associated with Upali Wijewardene slightly and briefly during the years 1978 to 1983 As a journalist on the Tamil Daily Virakesari I covered the Greater Colombo Economic Commission GCEC or free trade zone from 1978 to 1981 Upali was the first Director General of the GCEC Later in 1981 I began working as a staff reporter on the English daily The Island published by Upali Newspapers Ltd of which he was the proprietor I was at The Island in 1983 when Upali went missing 41 years ago The Island of Tuesday February 15 broke the sad news with a banner headline Plane carrying Upali Wijewardene feared lost It is in this context that this column focuses this week on Upali Wijewardene on his Birthday I have written about him in the past and will draw from those writings for this article In this piece I intend sharing some memories of my limited interaction with him Virakesari My first personal encounter with Upali Wijewardene was after he became head of the GCEC I was then a journalist on the Tamil daily Virakesari run by Express Newspapers Ceylon Ltd Our Chairman then was the wellknown industrialist AYS Gnanam When the GCEC was formed Gnanam was made a Deputy Director General by President JR Jayewardene Chairman Gnanam did not inform his newspaper company of the appointment When news of the GCEC appeared in other papers Virakesari had missed it When the GCEC held its first press conference at the Upali Group premises on Bloemendhal Road I was assigned to cover it I was also asked by my editors to get an exclusive interview with Wijewardene if possible When I approached Upali for the interview he agreed immediately When I went to see him the following day his greeting was So you missed the story about your Chairman being in the GCEC and now you are trying to make amends by doing a belated writeup He then guffawed loudly I warmed to him immediately Upali was a wonderful subject to interview He answered each question informatively and at times wittily Ananda Pelimuhandhiram who disappeared on the illfated flight along with Upali Wijewardene was present throughout the interview as a silent observer The interview turned out well and my editors were pleased Upali got it translated and was happy too Thereafter I was assigned the GCEC as one of my regular beats GCEC The GCEC was something new and controversial The Shannon experiment of Ireland was catching on in many parts of the world The idea of providing massive tax concessions and financial incentives to foreign capitalists to come and invest in Sri Lanka was a novel project at that time Looking back I think Wijewardena was the ideal man for the job at that time The GCEC went about its task methodically and diligently It was my duty then to record its progress regularly in the columns of Virakesari Due to the Gnanam connection the GCEC received top billing in the paper Vijitha Yapa who later became the pioneering editor of The Island was media liaison officer at the GCEC Ranjan Perera was Wijewardenas Secretary and was very helpful As most journalists know the Secretaries can cut you off literally and metaphorically from the boss I interacted a lot with Wijewardene while covering the GCEC When working for a Tamil newspaper I have come across many Sinhala persons who simply did not care a hoot about the Tamil media I have also come across many Sinhalese who were extremely concerned about what appeared in the Tamil newspapers Upali belonged to the latter group Though he could not read Tamil he got his Tamil employees at the Upali Group to inform him about what was appearing in the Virakesari Thus he was happy with my work and perhaps due to that made himself easily accessible I met him on more than one occasion then Also he was always ready to answer my questions whenever I telephoned him Sometimes I pestered him but he didnt seem to mind I remember Mrs Wijewardene once gently admonishing me on the phone He is a busy man you know and you shouldnt disturb him like thisLittle did I realise then that one day I would be working on Wijewardenes newspaper The Island and that someday Mrs Wijewardene would become my chairperson The opposition papers used to regularly publish negative stories about the GCEC I remember one particular news item about water shortages at the FTZ in the Communist Partys Forward weekly and I asked Upali some questions based on the news item He started chuckling and said You have read Forward Sheepishly I said Yes He then proceeded to answer This demonstrated that Wijewardene was keeping abreast of all the media reports on the GCEC I recall an incident where Upali addressed a seminar at Marga Institute I came in late when Upali was speaking and began taking down notes Upali saw me scribbling frantically after coming in late When the event ended Upali called me up and gave me the copy of his speech joking so that you can report in full As I stated before the GCEC was a novel new project and there were no Lankabased precedents to go by in writing about it Still I managed to write regularly on various aspects concerning the GCEC There was very little about the GCEC in the Tamil language then However the GCEC became a question at the GCE Advanced Level Economics paper I was immensely gratified when many teachers and students from Tamil schools wrote to me and the paper saying that they had only relied on articles and news in the Virakesari about the GCEC for the exams Such incidents make journalists feel that they are doing something worthwhile in this life One of the biggest criticisms against the GCEC then was that our workers were being exploited by the global capitalists Being somewhat left of centre in my political beliefs during the days of my youth I felt this charge was perfectly valid My perspective changed when I interviewed many of the girls employed at the FTZ Though factory workers many of them were well educated in the Sinhala medium and were politically conscious But they were realists One of them observed pithily in Sinhala that she knew she was getting only half a plate but if she agitated for a full plate then she may lose even this half a plate and go hungry Their families depended on them Talked Freely For some reason Upali Wijewardene used to talk freely on many matters with me in those days Perhaps he was at ease with me a young journalist on a Tamil newspaper without any hidden agenda or being linked to vested interests There was much speculation then in the media about his political ambition I thought then that he would focus on Kelaniya due to his Sedawatte connection and asked him directly but I was surprised when he said No the southIt was then that I came to know of his southern roots from his mothers side and the Sarath Wijesinghe relationship Later he earmarked the Kamburupitiya electoral division and began nursing it He focused on improving the standard of English among students in the area I once went to a meeting in the South where Upali spoke The cheers for him were loud huge and spontaneous The people on that side of the Bentara River loved Upali and regarded him as a true son of the southern soil After all southerners are known for their entrepreneurial acumen and success When I was working at Virakesari I once asked Wijewardene how he would resolve the ethnic crisis if he became Sri Lankas Head of State Of course the problem then was not as bad as it became later He thought a while and said that all people should be able to study and communicate with the government in their own language and that official administration should be done in all three languages and that no person should be discriminated against on grounds of race or religion He was of the view that all parts of the country should be developed evenly and access to jobs provided on merit basis Upali opined that when the country prospered economically the ethnic issue would lose its sting Reflecting upon this now I get the feeling that Upalis thoughts then do have the potential to help resolve the problem even now if implemented honestly and well The Island Subsequently I left Virakesari and joined The Island in November 1981 Wijewardene had nothing to do with my entry into English journalism My joining The Island was due to recommendations made by fellow journalists and friends Ajith Samaranayake and Ravindran Casinader who had started working for Sunday Island It was Vijitha Yapa now the owner of a string of bookshops who recruited me to The Island Wijewardene did not interfere with the recruitment of personnel for the editorial and I never tried to approach him either My earlier interaction with Wijewardene as a reporter ceased at a personal level after I became a journalist in his newspaper I was put on the Tamil affairs round by the Editor Vijitha Yapa and Deputy Editor Gamini Weerakoon I ran across Mr Wijewardene a few times in those days We simply smiled He seldom visited the editorial then Behind the Cadjan Curtain I remember Upali Wijewardene speaking to me directly only once after I had started working at The Island After a trip to Jaffna I began writing a series of articles for The Sunday Island Vijitha Yapa then made it a permanent column That was the Behind the Cadjan Curtain column It was a take on the iron curtain of the then Soviet Union and bamboo curtain of Peoples China Since Jaffna was then noted for rows and rows of cadjan fences the column was titled Behind the Cadjan curtain It was rather popular then Vijitha Yapas instructions to me about the column were simple Remember that you are writing for a predominantly Sinhala readership in English he said Explain the problems of the Tamils to them Think of it as building a bridge between the communitiesI have never forgotten those guidelines which influence my writing mode to this day Vijitha even used one of his own photographs of a kiduguvaeli or cadjan fence to design the columns logo Keep It Up One day I saw Upali Wijewardene at a distance within company precincts He was about to get into the car with Pelimuhandhiram who hailed me and beckoned When I went near Upali praised my column and said that he liked itKeep it up he said That was all I was thrilled A few months later came their fateful disappearance DBSJeyaraj

        "body": "The President in his policy statement said However contentment with this progress alone is not sufficient By September 2023 our total debt burden was US 91 billion One of the main points that were highlighted by the media from the policy statement presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on February 7 after opening of the new session of the Parliament was the need for unity among major political parties in Parliament He questioned as to why the Samagi Jana Balawegaya SJB cannot join the government if the Sri Lanka Podujana Permuna SLPP can do so in the interest of the country He also questioned as to why the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP could not join hands with his government if they could work with his party in 2015 with a view to eradicate corruption Again at a function to mark the inauguration of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project on Thursday the President reiterated his call for unity among political parties United we stand divided we fall is a widely used motto Unity is strength is another quote that has been used from time immemorial We are taught the value of unity at schools and by our religious leaders Hence it is a nice idea no doubt What the President means by his call to the political parties is not clear Does he mean that the political parties should come forward to share and carry out responsibilities that are needed to develop the economy Are he and the ruling parties prepared to do so Or does he mean to appoint the members of the Opposition parties as Ministers Or what he wants the Opposition parties to do is nothing but just to refrain from criticizing the government The President during his policy statement painted a rosy picture of the current situation of the country by comparing the situation in 2022 and now He said that the government was able to ease the economic hardships faced by the people However except for the absence of queues for fuel and cooking gas the struggle faced by the majority of the people in the country to make ends meet has not changed The government was able to end frustration over weeks long and miles long queues by obtaining further loans from the International Monetary Fund IMF and other international lenders imposing taxes on various sections of the masses and increasing electricity tariffs to incredible heights The government does not seem to have any other plan or strategy to repay the loans and develop the economy Hence sharing responsibilities sounds amusing On the other hand he could not have meant to share cabinet portfolios since he has been refusing to give in to the pressure exerted by the SLPP for the past one and a half years to expand the Cabinet by including some of its leading members in it Then does unity means nothing but toeing the line of the government in its every move If so this is the mildest way to silence the Opposition Although he is calling for unity citing the SLPPs joining hands with his party two years ago as an example the marriage then did not happen on any policy basis It was merely an arrangement by circumstances for the survival of both parties in the face of the Aragalaya the unprecedented public uprising against the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government It was not an arrangement for salvaging the economy or developing the country In fact Wickremesinghe accepted the responsibility of Prime Minister as the other Opposition parties did not respond positively when Gotabaya Rajapaksa who had been beleaguered by the economic factors first called for unity among political parties Rajapaksa had sacked two of his Ministers Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila on March 3 2022 but accepted a request by them for a discussion They during the discussion suggested to form an interim allparty government the motive of which was clear and Rajapaksa agreed to it Accordingly the President on April 1 2022 instructed his Cabinet to resign and called the Opposition parties to join the Cabinet But there were no takers not even those who suggested the move due to public upheaval Wickremesinghe instead supported the GotaGoHome protest Yet another irony was that Wickremesinghe even after he assumed office as Prime Minister on May 14 2022 amidst the turmoil that followed the attack on the protesters by the supporters of the then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa expressed solidarity with the Aragalaya It was an interesting decision he on the one hand accepted Gotabayas unity call and the Premiership yet on the other instructed Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake to provide facilities to the protesters who were hell bent on ousting President Rajapaksa He said he would appoint a committee headed by the Deputy Leader of his party Ruwan Wijewardene for the same purpose It was a wellknown fact that if the President stepped down willingly or was compelled to by the circumstances the Prime Minister would take over It really happened on July 9 when Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country Wickremesinghe took oaths as the President on July 20 and ordered a crackdown on the protesters which in turn cemented the possibility of his election as the President by Parliament for the rest of Gotabayas term These were the circumstances that united the UNP and the SLPP It was merely a tryst of the struggles of the two parties for survival There was no agreement or at least a discussion on the recovery of the economy And interestingly both parties were keen to show that they did not have such agreements between them even after that On the day the Parliament elected Wickremesinghe as President he in response to a question by a foreign journalist stated that he was not a friend of the Rajapaksas while the SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa told the media that he voted for Dalles Alahapperuma at the Parliamentary vote for the election of the President Nobody believed either of the remarks They continued to show the ironic combination of the absence of policy basis for their relationship and the circumstantial compulsion for it For instance Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a statement criticizing President Wickremesinghes tax policy on December 20 after his party having played the main role in passing the highly controversial Value Added Tax Amendment Bill nine days before The government should have respected the democratic rights of the Opposition before inviting it for unity The way how it scuttled the conducting of local government elections despite a Supreme Court ruling not to withhold funds allocated for the purpose and moves to bring in repressive laws such as the controversial Online Safety Act and the AntiTerrorism Bill have widened the already vast gulf between the ruling parties and the Opposition parties Unity is suggested primarily for the recovery of the economy for which the government has only the programme involving the IMF with it However it is a temporary programme to address the immediate issues and not a longterm development process The President also in his very policy statement said However contentment with this progress alone is not sufficient By September 2023 our total debt burden was US 91 billion It will take a considerable period of time to settle this debt In order to meet our debt we need to source the funds locally It is imperative that we generate this income otherwise we risk falling into the debt trap once again Hence unity should not be a move for the survival of political parties and politicians or an effort to weaken the Opposition which is against democracy The need of the hour is for the experts in all parties to formulate an economic plan to address the shortterm and longterm issues which the country is faced with"

        "body": "Children sit inside a vehicle loaded with items secured by rope as people flee the southern city of Rafah toward the centre of the Gaza Strip to escape Israels ground war in the city Photo by Mohammed AbedAFP Never has an Israeli government been as cruel or malicious as Benjamin Netanyahus hardline government which is planning to unleash what is feared as the worst phase of Israels genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip With 15 million starving and suffering Palestinians crammed into the southern Gaza city of Rafah Israel has pledged to launch a massive ground air and sea offensive And never has a United States government been as weak in its diplomatic coercion as the present Joe Biden administration is Diplomatic power is seen not only when a nation uses its diplomatic clout to tame a hostile nation but also in the ability to coax or coerce a friend When Israel the United States most trusted ally spurns Washingtons open and behindthescenes diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire and a hostage deal the humiliated Joe Biden administration instead of getting tough with Israel has shifted gears to toe Israels genocidal line even though it describes the death toll of nearly 30000 Palestinians as over the top or unacceptable It is also reported that an angry Biden referred to Netanyahu as an as h But soon he diluted his opposition to the Rafah operation telling Netanyahu that it should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there The remark amounts to giving the green light for the carnage The Democratmajority Senate passed more funds for the Israeli war efforts while the White House spokesman said Washington would continue to support Israel and make sure they have the tools and the capabilities to continue military operations Since Israel was planted on Palestinian territory in 1947 all US administrations except the John F Kennedy government have stood by Israel even to the extent of endorsing the Zionist states war crimes and horrible human rights violations But they all had a red line Ronald Reagan for instance knew how to tell Israel to behave itself without breaking the special ties the US had with Israel Lawrence J Korb who as assistant defence secretary played a significant role in shaping the defence policy of the Reagan administration argues that Republican presidents have been more critical of Israel than Democrat presidents In a 2021 article he says President Reagan for whom I had the honour of serving for four and a half years actually allowed 21 UN resolutions that directly or indirectly condemned Israeli behaviour and actions to pass These included condemning Israel for the bombing of Lebanon Iraq and Tunisia George HW Bush allowed nine UN resolutions including one that criticised Israel for deporting Palestinians that it perceived as antiIsrael to pass while George W Bush allowed six more including one that called on Israel to stop demolishing the houses of Palestinian civilians Obama allowed only one UN resolution against the expansion of the settlements to pass before leaving office in December 2016 But the worst record is that of Bidens as far as humanitarianism is concerned He has proved that he is ready to stoop so low as to be labelled as the biggest stooge in its defence of Israels genocide in Gaza Bidens diplomatic clout is as weak as his fading memory power the cause for a special investigator not to pursue legal action against him for keeping classified documents Former President Donald Trump however is fighting a legal battle to save himself from prison terms for the same offence In recent utterances Biden referred to Egypt as Mexico French President Emmanuel Macron as Francois Mitterrand and Hamas as the opposition much to the embarrassment of his team in this election year It is no surprise when Israel shows little respect for such a weak and senile president who is hurtling headlong towards defeat in the November presidential election Israel knows the next Republican president will be there to support it financially militarily and immorally This unwavering support from the United States has emboldened Israel to commit crimes against humanity and escape sanctions international isolation or punishment One of the foreign policy objectives of the US is to ensure Israel survives in the strategically religiously and even eschatologically important Middle Eastern region Disregarding the growing global appeal against a possible catastrophe on the 62squarekilometre Rafah Netanyahu more for his own political survival than for Israels longterm security interests has set out to commit the most heinous phase of his genocide which has already killed or maimed more than 100000 Palestinians with 70 percent of the victims being women and children He has already used on Palestinian civilian targets the type of firepower countries usually use against military targets Besides the Netanyahu government which includes extremists such as the convicted racist Itamar BenGvir who holds the national security portfolio uses starvation and denial of medical supplies and medical facilities as a weapon to expedite the process of wiping out the Palestinian population from Gaza It needs to be mentioned here that southern cities such as Khan Yunis and Rafah were declared safe havens by Israel for Palestinian civilians to move into when on October 7 last year it launched the worlds first livestreamed ethnic cleansing and genocide With the Biden administration giving its tacit approval to the Rafah carnage saying Israel has the right to pursue legitimate military targets in the culdesac last refuge of the Palestinians the hardline Zionist regime is untroubled by the growing world opinion against the move South Africa which is spearheading the global peaceloving constituencys campaign to stop the genocide in Gaza invoked the International Court of Justices intervention to stop the calamity awaiting the continuouslybattered Palestinians But the Netanyahu government is unmoved The European Union Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has urged Israels allies especially the US to stop sending weapons to Israel if they believe too many people have been killed in Gaza But Israel does not care a damn about world opinion The Netanyahu governments behaviour adds credibility to the claims that the United States is not ruled by elected representatives but by Zionist Israel Netanyahus only response was that the war would continue until Hamas was eliminated and that Israel would provide safe passage for the civilian population so they could leave Leave where To Egypt The Egyptian government is not in a position to open the Rafah border without jeopardising ties with Israel and the US Netanyahu says the civilians could go north But this is a death trap as there are no safe zones in the north There is no food aid no medical facilities and no electricity The north is simply uninhabitable Besides Israel cannot be trusted with its safezone or safepassage promises as its murderous behaviour in the southern safe zones has shown It appears that the worst is yet to happen in the Gaza Strip"

Minister Dr S Jaishankar Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval The delegation was afforded a broad overview of Indias growth momentum industrialization and its security interests in the regionNational Peoples Power NPP MP Vijitha Herath who was part of the party delegation that visited India shared his thoughts on the outcome Excerpts Q How far is the policy of your party in line with the broader vision of India for national security in the region Regional security is something that matters to Sri Lanka as well We have to uphold national security territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka In case a conflict erupts in the region it is bound to have spillover effects on Sri Lanka As such we stand for regional security at the highest possible level The Indian leaders talked about regional security with us We made it clear that Sri Lanka as a country would remain committed to regional security It is our policy We did not discuss in details what specific action will be taken in this direction though Q You met with Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval Once an Indian envoy said Sri Lankas security is Indias security and vice versa How acceptable is this statement We accept it for sure We can look at Russia and Ukraine for insights What happens in Ukraine has a bearing on Russia and vice versa If we act like Ukraine we will only end up being a victim of superpower rivalry in the world It is common knowledge that India China and the United States are in a global power rivalry If we become party to that rivalry the fate that befell Ukraine will befall us Any conflict situation in Sri Lanka will affect India and vice versa The Security of India and Sri Lanka is intertwined Q Like India China also has geopolitical interests in the region It has become a difficult task for the successive Sri Lankan governments to strike a balance between India and China The public perception is that your party is close to China How do you intend to manage ties with these two countries We have maintained healthy ties with the Communist Party of China CPC It is not a hindrance for us to have ties with India Any IndiaChina trade rivalry is irrelevant to us We explore what is best to be taken from both China and India in the greater interests of the Sri Lankan people We wont make any IndiaChina rivalry an issue for us We have spelt out our policies to both the countries Q Will there be any Indiacentric approach as far as national security is concerned There is nothing like that One cannot say we are aligned more with one country and less with the other We will prioritize Sri Lankas national interests We will stand for our security interests in the event of any adverse action from any country Q Does it mean to say that you will not compromise on the interests of one country It is a mistake done in our country that the interests of one country were compromised over the other In the awarding of projects we have followed such an approach When the Norochcholai coal power plant was awarded to China the Sampur project was awarded to India We are not for such a policy Q Does it mean projects will be awarded only according to an open tender process in future As far as projects are concerned we are for calling for tenders according to a transparent criterion and procurement guidelines We look at what is best for the country and decide For example the contract for printing digital identity cards had been awarded to a company in South India We raised it in the House The government cancelled the project and decided to go for tender calling That is good In India there are numerous organizations ready to undertake such a contract The Adani Group is not the only company in operation in India If there is a tender process the Adani Group and other companies can apply We should look at the best deal for Sri Lanka We have a question Why cant we develop our NLDB and Milco based on the Amul model That is what we should learn But the government does the exact opposite here We believe we can develop the NLDB and Milco based on insights from Amul Q What is your overall impression about the invitation to visit India It is actually special Locally and internationally everybody understands that people are with us President Ranil Wickremesinghe holds office without any mandate from people He was appointed through a constitutional procedure only The international community has sensed who will win We got this invitation in such a context We are happy about it Q Indias main focus is connectivity Already there are numerous connectivity projects going on Those include the grid connectivity project and the proposed land bridge Did you discuss anything about them We did not touch on them Those are matters for the governments of the two countries to proceed with We will deal with them when we secure power to rule the country Q Can you tell me something about these connectivity projects We did not discuss it It was not relevant to this visit We will look into it separately Q India achieved giant development strides after the implementation of economic reforms in consultation with the International Monetary Fund IMF at one point What is your view on Indias economic model There are insights to be derived from the Indian economic model We will definitely seek them Q I am asking about economic liberalization and market economy What is your view It is nothing to be learnt from India only It is practiced in many other countries in the world today What inspired us in India is the service sector particularly the development of the Information Technology IT sector The IT sector contribution accounts for a greater percentage of Indias GDP It first started in Kerala in the 1990s and then expanded to other states Ours is a small country We need to enter the global IT market Still we lack capacity But we can try to enter the market through Indian companies We briefed India about it The Indian government is ready to help us Q You had a different attitude towards India in the past Is there a change of attitude towards the current India after the visit It is not like that We were aware of how India was governed in the past There is nothing new to be learnt now If you ask about the past issue it was something linked to the world politics at that time The United States was one powerhouse Then President late JR Jayewardene aligned with the United States As a result we had to succumb to Indian pressure Now it is a different situation Soviet Russia is no more India was close to Soviet Russia at that time Now the global landscape has transformed Q I am asking about your attitude towards India now Our bond got strengthened It is not a postvisit change of attitude The visit furthered our mutual understanding and respect for each other We learned how to work closely as two countries Q You visited Indias Amul dairy plant It is a farmer cooperative a model common in a socialist economic system Do you think it is a model that can be adopted in Sri Lanka We visited not only Amul but also Tata It is better not to highlight Amul only We visited Techno parks Yes Amul is a cooperative Dairy farmers at grassroots level hold shares in it They get dividends This is not the first time we visited Amul Our leader comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited it in the past when he was the Agriculture Minister We have a question Why cant we develop our National Livestock Development Board NLDB and Milco based on the Amul model That is what we should learn But the government does the exact opposite here The government rendered both Milco and the NLDB economically unviable and is trying to sell them off to Amul We dont approve of it There are over 30 state institutes earmarked for privatization There is no tender procedure here If we intend to sell them NLDB Milco to Amul we should follow the tender procedure allowing other companies to participate in it That has not been done yet The government has chosen Amul and its local partner There is no transparency We believe we can develop the NLDB and Milco based on insights from Amul Q Now the government has progressed in this transaction Can it be reversed now The Memorandum of Understanding has been signed and the valuation is in progress We are against such transactions There is no contradiction in our position We should learn from Amul not to divest our ventures to them but to develop them in our own country We did not go and strike a deal with Amul We learnt a lot from Tata too That is about manufacturing vehicles using the latest technology We dont manufacture vehicles where as Tata does in India We learnt about the local manufacturing base If India can manufacture why cant we do it Q You visited Kerala in India where there is a left leaning government Yours is also a leftist party What is your impression about the leftist model in Kerala The education and health sectors are well advanced in Kerala In other states of India inequality is high whereas it is much less in Kerala In Gujarat there are hapless people begging for money despite the presence of a wealthy merchant class In Kerala we noticed a middle layer of society which is not extremely rich or extremely poor The Gross Domestic Product GDP size of Gujarat is much higher though We found an equitable distribution of wealth in Kerala to a great extent Kerala has produced the highest number of Indian professionals working abroad Human development is very high in Kerala as we observed Q Is Kerala the most attractive state for you Our experience from each state was unique In Gujarat the institution called iCreate is encouraging It is meant to encourage those with innovation If someone innovates something he will be supported through this institution In Sri Lanka if someone innovates something there is no one to support him for further improvement of it In Gujarat the State Government has set up this institution dedicated for this purpose NPP team meeting the Chief Minister of Gujarat"

        "body": "As I was admiring a skyscraper I was jolted back to reality by a rickety old bus pulling up in front of it Somehow the blueprint to make Colombo worldclass seems to have forgotten all about public transport Colombo is a city in a hurry New hotels shopping malls and highways are mushrooming everywhere and the skyline keeps growing upwards promising to take us to a worldclass future I went to Galle Face and Port City recently to soak in the Global City in progress As I was admiring a brightlylit skyscraper I was jolted back to reality by a rickety old bus pulling up in front of it Somehow the blueprint to make Colombo worldclass seems to have forgotten all about public transport Buses and trains are by far the most affordable modes of transport in Colombo a bus ride from Mount Lavinia to Pettah costs about Rs 85 about 110th the price of a threewheeler hire and trains are almost as inexpensive Yet the public transport system is so uncomfortable inconvenient outdated and even unsafe that it has lost almost everyone who could afford private transportation The result is endless traffic jams a glut of threewheelers smogfilled skies and a car culture Sri Lanka can illafford As experts have long known wider roads lead to more traffic not less congestion in the longrun and one look at Parliament Road at rush hour when average speeds plummet to 8 kmh by some measures is all it takes to understand this paradox Cars highways and fuel also eat up a tremendous amount of foreign exchange which as the recent economic crisis reminded us our economy with its limited export base cannot really afford With a weak rupee tax hikes slashed fuel subsidies and import restrictions a used car has become more expensive than a suburban house and owning and operating a car is no longer a realistic possibility even for the middle class Despite all the investments in highways all but a handful of the urban elite now have no choice but to rely on a woefully inadequate bus and train system and expensive private alternatives like taxis and threewheelers As Gustavo Petro the former Mayor of Bogot the Colombian capital famously said A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars Its where the rich use public transportation In Sri Lanka the poor dont have cars and the rich dont use public transport The economic case for improving public transport is straightforward It is one of those rare investments that can make the economy more efficient equitable and sustainable Yet it seems like we are stuck in a vicious cycle since the infrastructure is expensive and the government is too broke to make such ambitious investments Is there a way out of this predicament If there is one area that the government should seek the help of donors and foreign investors this should be it In fact we already missed two opportunities the LightRail Transit LRT project funded by a generous Japanese loan and urban transport development assistance in the US Millennium Challenge Corporation MCC grant There is an ADBfunded railway improvement project that is still alive If the government is keen to avoid further debt traps like expensive highways there are plenty of relatively lowcost highreturn options available We can turn to the experience of other developing countries and some of the most interesting examples come from Latin American cities that have pioneered innovative ways to make public transport work In the 1970s Curitiba a city in southern Brazil similar in size to Colombo built a simple Bus Rapid Transit BRT system at a fraction of the cost of a more technologically sophisticated subway rail system Since then other cities have followed this path the most famous example being the muchstudied TransMilenio BRT system in Bogot which managed to lower air pollution by 40 percent and commuting times by 32 percent within just five years of operation Each BRT system is different but among their essential features are energyefficient buses dedicated bus lanes with rightofway accessible bus stands and streamlined ticketing systems While none of these systems are perfect and some have struggled to live up to their early promise they offer valuable lessons for us to think creatively about what works for our own city In fact Sri Lankas own Urban Transport Master Plan of 2014 already incorporated many of these ideas including upgraded rail and BRT systems for three urbansuburban corridors What Sri Lanka lacks is action not plans We can start with incremental improvements to the existing bus system The first step should be to gradually replace the 1970s vintage diesel monsters with comfortable accessible and energyefficient buses The recent government proposal to introduce 200 airconditioned electricpowered buses to routes frequented by middleclass office workers is a good step in this direction although it might make more sense to go with hybrid buses that do not require expensive charging infrastructure The next step should be new regulations for private buses for example unsafe forms of competition can be reduced by auctioning off exclusive licenses for each bus route where bus operators are paid for the distance they cover rather than the number of passengers they carry At the same time the busiest sections of the railway can be upgraded and electrified In the longer term a BRT monorail or LRT should be introduced along main arteries such as Galle Road HighLevel Road and Parliament Road Whatever the technology that is adopted should adhere to the following principles Different modes of transport trains buses bicycles threewheelers walking paths pedestrian plazas should be integrated so that they seamlessly feed into each other Upgraded public transport networks should be paired with public housing so that lowincome households in the urban periphery especially those who have been displaced by urban regeneration projects can maintain access to livelihoods The system does not need to be completely selffinancing In fact there are compelling reasons to heavily subsidize the use of urban public transport due to all the positive externalities it generates Rather than relying on user fees property taxes can be utilized to finance maintenance essentially capturing a part of the increase in land value rents that results from infrastructure upgrades We could also draw on taxes on automobiles fuel and congestion which would further incentivize commuters to give up cars for buses and trains Whenever we hear about the governments latest plans to make Colombo a tourist hub lets ask ourselves the following question if a city is not livable for its residents can it really be worldclass for tourists and investors The cancelled LRT project would have reduced commuting time from Battaramulla to Fort by 30 minutes saving the average commuter 20 hours of wasted time on the road each month Reduced congestion would also help those who continue to drive saving as many as 40 hours a month for someone commuting from 30km away according to a study of a similar monorail project Compare this to the tangible benefits from projects like the Lotus Tower Due to misplaced priorities Colombo now looks like a heart patient who has got carried away with cosmetic surgery Lets resolve to get our arteries unclogged before we splurge on any more facelifts Sanjay De Silva is an Associate Professor of Economics at Bard College New York and Research Associate at Verit Research He is currently working on the history of urban development

        "body": "The Policy Drift Towards Disaster People waiting for hours to refill liquefied petroleum gas cylinders during Sri Lankas economic crisis of 2022 There are worrying signs that policymakers and political parties simply have not grasped the magnitude of the problem at hand The current direction of Sri Lankas economy and the overall mindset of a majority of economic and policy elites within and beyond the State suggests a trajectory that will keep Sri Lanka dependent on foreign debtfinanced trade deficits vulnerable to shocks from energy prices and unprepared for the next wave of transformation and economic growth Its not the stunning absence of a consolidated national industrial plan to develop the next wave of hightechnology exportoriented industries nor the gaping sectorwide Governance Deficits in health education security finance taxation the legal system etc that should cause alarm Its the nonchalance with which a caricature of Sri Lankas economic woes is paraded openly contradicting basic realities Many still believe that Sri Lankas economic distress was caused by a government that spends too much money on subsidies social protections and welfare creating a culture of freebies and dependency that disincentivizes productive work These are distortions of the real problem Spending Relative to Income When you make a statement related to expenditure you ought to do so in relative terms A relative expenditure comparison also requires a parallel revenue component meaning how much is being spent relative to what is being earned providing a more complete understanding of expenditure In such a context Sri Lanka is actually a low spender relative to our income compared to peergroup countries According to the IMF based on 2022 data Sri Lankas Government Expenditure as a percentage of GDP stood at 185 around the same level as Uganda Costa Rica Chad Tanzania and the Dominican Republic Countries with the lowest Government Expenditure to GDP include Bangladesh 13 Ethiopia 12 Lebanon 11 Haiti 8 Iran whilst advanced economies such as France Italy and Austria are usually above 50 the UK Japan and Sweden are around the 45 range If we just consider public spending on social assistance relative to income Total State Social Spending to GDP and Net Social Spending to GDP World Bank data show countries that are broadly in Sri Lankas income bracket have higher social spending On average per annum India Thailand and Vietnam spend around 15 of GDP on social assistance Algeria spends 23 and Chile 35 Sri Lanka averaged 04 of GDP on social assistance in the 5 years leading up to 2020 which was less than Cambodia Bangladesh Tajikistan Rwanda Indonesia and Malaysia The World Bank Human Capital Index 2020 states unambiguously that Sri Lankas expenditure on social assistance is lower than both the regional average 11 and the average for its income group 14 The largesse of government expenditure programmes the misallocations of resources and the mismanagement of finances are all real and significant issues that need to be addressed and indeed should have been prioritized as part of the IMFs fiscal consolidation Yet in terms of social spending it is difficult to make the argument that successive Sri Lankan Governments have consistently gifted free benefits en masse to the public This should not be confused with the patronage driven jobs for boys culture prevalent in the many StateOwned Enterprises and the dynamic within the civil service of deteriorating quality and increasing head count Irreversible Effects on WellBeing Consider a 2020 Report published by the International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth part of UNICEF titled Social Spending in South Asia An overview of Government Expenditure on Health Education and Social Assistance C Bloch The authors note that social spending is crucial to ensuring access to basic care education and socialsafety nets the market often fails to deliver health and education services at least to those who cannot afford them leading to underinvestment and limited access to basic services which in turn can have longlasting and even irreversible effects on the populations wellbeing The UNICEF Report also states that South Asia on average spends less than 1 of GDP on social assistance which places the region at the bottom of the global distribution as other regions spend comparatively more India Nepal and the Maldives are the only countries with public spending on social assistance exceeding 1 of GDP Figures 1 and 2 below illustrate that South Asia is below the global average and that Sri Lanka is below the regional average Distress Signals Much of the Sri Lankan economic commentariat has become fixated on Government Spending seemingly satisfied with the revenue side of the equation Sri Lankas Government Revenue to GDP is low by global and regional standards and it is low compared to many peergroup nations The tax structure is also regressive with Corporate Income Tax CIT accounting for a smaller portion of our total tax revenue and a majority of revenue being generated from indirect taxes such as VAT which disproportionately impacts the poor That Sri Lankas fiscal equation suffers from inadequate revenue and not excessive spending is not a subjective opinion it has been the consistent observation of international organizations based on actual data measured against globally accepted benchmarks In 2018 the IMF told Sri Lanka it needed further revenueside reforms in May 2019 it noted Sri Lankas failure to achieve the intended revenue targets stating that the shortfall reflects weaker growth the delay in implementing the 2018 budget measures and an underperformance in trade tax collections due to import duty waivers In November 2022 the IMF repeats From an international perspective persistently large fiscal deficits in Sri Lanka reflect relatively low tax revenues not excessively high government expenditures I have written previously that the current Personal Income Tax PIT Structure and tax slabs are inequitable in that they are not progressive on the upperend there is no topmarginal income tax rate after a certain point no matter how much monthly income one earns the rate of tax remains the same There is also the welldocumented issue of tax allowances and sectorspecific tax exemptions which inevitably creates a gap between the statutory corporate income tax CIT rate and the effective corporate income tax rate Again this is not my personal opinion The aforementioned IMF report from 2022 states that Sri Lankas taxtoGDP ratio is among the lowest in the world and its tax system stands out with its low rates small base and complexity Aligning its PIT rate schedule with other Asian emerging market economies and removing sectorspecific CIT exemptions could generate around 07 percent of GDP in additional revenue Reviews and reports from the IMF the Asian Development Bank ADB and the World Bank WB have been calling for tax revenue mobilisation for several years leading up to the Gotabaya Tax Cuts Sri Lankas Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was reported at 106 in Sep 2023 as per the CEIC Economic Database The Policy Nexus Crucially I want to remind the reader that the debilitating 2019 tax cuts were advertised in the Gotabaya manifesto and actually enjoyed widespread support among major corporate elites and business entities during its implementation this tax relief was also cheered on by major business journals associations chambers These groups are not evil not necessarily selfish and certainly not illinformed They are however incentivized to seek benefits and advantages for themselves and their industries this is not sinister or insidious businesses must seek to maximize profits and shareholder value There has always been in every modern society links between business enterprise and the State an alliance which has brought enormous benefits to wider society We can also admit that enterprise uses its links to Government its financial power and its lobby capacities to influence State policy and adjust incentives based on an admittedly narrow set of interests The 2019 tax cuts were partly a coalescence of public policy and the business establishment resulting in a consolidation of policy direction which ran counter to the revenue based fiscal consolidation being advocated by International Financial Institutions The Gotabaya manifesto had positive reviews before its implementation In late 2019 a CFA qualified writer stated that Vistas was supplyside and businessfriendly despite the economist W A Wijewardena writing that Gotabayas policies would bring significant State involvement and control in the economy The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce CCC welcomed the 2021 budget for its tax stability stating its confidence that the commendable proposals in the Budget will see timely implementation and will continue to involve private sector consultation This is the crux of the matter if there was private sector consultation as suggested how was the rationale for the taxcuts justified in the context of Sri Lankas welldocumented struggle to raise government revenue How did the private sector with all its analysis fail to heed the clear advice of the international financial organizations including the IMF Read or listen to any report from the major economic ThinkTanks in Sri Lanka and you will find consistent commentary on economic distortions created by pricecontrols tariffs quotas import restrictions that largely result from the representations of corporate institutional power What are the results of this nexus between large business enterprises individuals with extreme levels of wealth and the governing establishment and policy elites One of Sri Lankas richest men is openly campaigning for the nomination of the SLPP as its candidate for the Presidency even being present at their national convention last year Another owner of a media house with close links to the SLPP is also running a major Presidential campaign Against this context in January 2024 the JVPled National Peoples Power NPP including its leadership held discussions with the CCC ostensibly to further refine its economic policies The statement released thereafter included an interesting turn of phrase The NPP was of the view that the current direct and indirect tax rates are too high and impact growth as high taxes reduce consumption and contract the economy The NPP was also of the view that high corporate tax prevents reinvestment Take this statement together with President Wickremesinghes comments during his most recent National Address regarding providing the people with some relief from the increase in VAT On one side Sri Lankas MarxistLeninist Party meets one of the countrys main business chambers and releases a statement that suggests Corporate Taxes are too high even though empirical data suggests that Sri Lankas Corporate Sector does not contribute adequate levels of tax revenue compared to other countries On the other hand in a context of Sri Lanka missing the IMFs intended revenue targets the President promises VAT relief in a matter of months after his own government increased VAT These are symptoms of the election year and as I warned at the outset of this article it is evidence that political parties have yet to grasp the seriousness of Sri Lankas revenue weakness This trajectory of aimless policy will perpetuate Sri Lankas culture of dependency on international debt markets it will leave Sri Lankas poorest and most vulnerable on the cusp of destitution The kind of society that is emerging from the current policy trajectory will not be placated by another IMF Programme The policy statusquo is

        "body": "On 10 February this newspaper drew attention to a not so new law the NonGovernmental Organisations Registration and Supervision Bill which the government claims is now ready The Bill itself has been in the making for a long period dating back to the era when our present President was Prime Minister of the country in 2017 The aim of the bill as its name suggests is to register and supervise the activities of the NGOs in the country Many Lankan leaders have attempted to use NGOs to promote their particular agendas Unfortunately at different times NGOs have fallen for the ruses of politicians Rather than involving themselves in meeting emergency situations or human needs a number of NGOs have entangled themselves in narrow party political affiliated activities However whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation what is frightening about the NonGovernmental Organisations Registration and Supervision Bill is its timing It is being brought in at a time when civic spaces are seen to being shut and opposing points of view suppressed A few of them come to mind The Online Safety Bill an attempt to silence social media users via criminalising dissenting points of view The new AntiTerrorism Bill which is nearing completion and The Broadcasting Authority Bill a threat to mainstream media freedom In this way these diverse legislative measures provide the government an opportunity to upload disinformation without space for dissent However the NGO Registration and Supervision Bill is a reaction to the actions of a number of NGOs who have allowed themselves to be perceived as being aligned to particular political groupings For instance quite often participants at NGOsponsored protest demonstrations are provided transport meals and on occasion even batta to make up for losses incurred by absenting themselves from workplaces In other words protestors gather not for belief in a particular cause but for the addon monetary benefits etc In turn these practices lead to suspicion that external funding agents have a vested interest in the promotion of such activities While the role of NGOs arises out of the governments inability to meet the particular needs of deprived sections of the community NGO involvement in the political field is suspicious to say the least NGOs have also taken unto themselves the role of supervising and holding to account the diverse actions of different governments No one questions the right of a private person or group of persons to hold the government to account for its actioninaction on issues of justice or miscarriage of justice What is questionable however is that these groups NGOs receive aid from external sources who may have their own agendas which may be inimical to the public good A number of cases come to mind During the near three decade long ethnic war large numbers of international NGOs INGOs flooded the country They operated behind the governments line on control Thousands of dollars were spent by these INGOs to uplift civilians caught up in a struggle they had no control over At the end of the war then Secretary of Defence Gotabaya sent a number of journalists to visit the wartorn areas On their return the journalists spoke in detail of the deprivation of the people the dilapidated condition of roads and housing the lack of food and medical facilities the LTTE airbase in the Vanni and the large amount of machinery and vehicles abandoned by fleeing LTTEers Speaking to the journalists Gotabaya queried So what did you see of the work done by the NGOs and INGOs No one answered There was nothing verifiable seen by them Today there are around 50000 NGOs working in the country The groups receive around Rs 100 billion in foreign funding annually There is little or no control over the use of these funds or who benefits from them We do not need governmentappointed supervisors to oversee NGO activities After all it is governments failures which created the need for NGO activity The need of the hour is a selfgoverning body for NGOs The Editors Guild and the Press Complaints Commission are examples which come to mind"

        "body": "What a difference could it have made to the country On the eve of JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayakes muchtalkedabout visit to India lets take a journey into counterfactual history Imagine the late JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera travelling to New Delhi in 1987 or more plausibly an industrious JR Jayawardene coaxing his Indian counterpart to invite Wijeweera Granted that is a tall order considering that in the JVPs assessment payoffs of perpetuating violent opposition to the IndoLanka Peace Accord favoured it over striking a compromise That favourable context for a violent takeover remained so until Black Cats PRA and all the other assorted statebacked antiJVP para militaries came to life The JVP started targeting families of military personnel or someone else did it and conveniently put it on the JVP account shifting the military attitude into outright hostility towards the JVP Still in this what if hypothetical scenario had the JVP leader undertaken the visit which might have mellowed his opposition to the IndoLanka Peace Accord how different would it have been for Sri Lanka today That would have saved 60000 young lives lost to the Southern Insurgency Equally importantly it would have saved the country from a three decades of terrorist struggle of the LTTE By the time R Premadasa placating JVP and other naysayers demanded the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force IPKF it had already forced the LTTE to retreat to the last jungle hideouts in Mullaitivu and was pounding it with helicopter gunships IPKF left an unfinished business which then engulfed Sri Lanka for the next three decades That is the lasting cruel legacy of the JVPs second insurgency not so much the bout of carnage and mayhem in 198889 Assuming the economic cost of the Eelam war including the direct cost and foregone investment and tourist revenues etc at 2 of the GDP annually Sri Lanka would have been twice as rich as it is today had it not been for that fateful decision Not to mention the thousands of lives lost during the succeeding years the shattered dreams and the tragic fate of two generations of Tamil youth Also one cruel irony seen in the recent history of international political economy is that a short spell in state terror like one witnessed in the state crackdown of the JVP in 1989 tends to be followed by an outburst of economic growth Taiwan in the 60s under Chiang Kaishek Chile under Pinochet in the 70s and Peru under Fujimori in the 90s are examples However having defeated one insurrection Sri Lanka was compelled to fight another for the next thirty years Today the JVP is capitalizing on the public disgruntlement at the economic crisis just like Wijeweera exploited popular resentment at the Indian intervention Unlike in the past it has a credible still distant shot at power not out of any particular policy strength but due to its ability to exploit popular anger However with every passing day with the Rupee appreciating and tourists arriving in droves the JVPs electability is vanishing That incentivizes it to perpetuate the crisis amplify grievances and obstruct economic reforms The JVP has come a long way from its violent past but the policy paralysis it could inflict through street protests could equally be devastating One of the most immediate victims is the expanding Indian investment portfolio in the country But this time the JVP leadership actually travelled to New Delhi on an invitation by the Indian government The JVP and NPP stalwarts have portrayed the invitation by New Delhi as the latter acknowledging Anura K as the next President or the JVP as the future government However the primary motive of the Indian invitation is likely to preempt the potential JVP protestations to Adani Amul milk and the potential transfer of the majority stake of Sri Lanka Telecom to Reliance Jio However with every passing day with the Rupee appreciating and tourists arriving in droves the JVPs electability is vanishing That incentivizes it to perpetuate the crisis amplify grievances and obstruct economic reforms Coopting the JVP would help soften its stance on Indian investment It also compels the JVP to assume a degree of responsibility though electoral considerations would always come to conflict Anura Kumara Dissanayake met with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra Mr Dissanayake and his delegation also undertook a study tour to Gujarat to explore the development model of Prime Minister Modis home state and visited an Amul Milk complex in Ahmedabad Meanwhile back home Namal Karunarane the national organizer of the farmers association a JVP front was virulently opposing the advent of the Amul company in Sri Lanka Indian overtures are not necessarily new Tamil political parties have regularly paid homage to New Delhi The recent gesture indicates a widening net targeting the Southern political parties who tend to have a less favourable opinion about India than their Northern peers In normal times various naysayers in Colombo could have viewed such overtures as intrusive However New Delhi might bet that sentiments are improving in light of the US 4 billion Indian lifeline during the economic crisis Pseudo patriots who cry interference at every Indian move in Sri Lanka are yet to be heard Instead the opponents have lampooned the JVP leader whose visit they say was arranged by President Ranil Wickremesinghe who might expect that newfound wisdom during the Indian visit would tone down JVP opposition to economic reforms Whether the President had pulled strings from behind is not clear Yet he is likely to gain from a favourable behaviour change of the JVP However parodying Mr Dissanayake may hinder such positive development Though the JVP has shed much of the past baggage its strength lies only in the extent of the clamour of its opposition Mr Dissanayake is a captive of this status quo Whether the Indian visit would change that is yet to be seen Follow RangaJayasuriya on Twitter"

        "body": "It is feared that an Indian States restrictive law on livein relationships may be replicated by other conservative State governments in India Earlier this month the Legislative Assembly of Uttarakhand a North Indian State at the foot of the Himalayas passed a Uniform Civil Code UCC While most of the provisions were progressive there were some which put fetters on livein relationships to the extent of criminalizing them These provisions have come in for much criticism on the grounds that they invade privacy and individual liberty guaranteed by the Indian constitution The law defines livingin as a relationship between a man and a woman who cohabit in a shared household through a relationship in the nature of marriage The Bill aims to regulate livein relationships by imposing an obligation to register them Section 378 makes it mandatory for partners in a livein relationship in the Uttarakhand State irrespective of whether they are permanent residents of Uttarakhand or not to submit a statement of about a livein relationship to the Registrar within whose jurisdiction they are residing If such a relationship is to be terminated the Registrar has to be informed The statement declaring a livein relationship will then be forwarded to the officerincharge of the local police station In case either of the partners is less than 21 years of age a copy of the declaration will also be sent to their parents or guardians The Registrar will then conduct a summary inquiry to ensure that the relationship does not fall under any of the prohibited categories mentioned under Section 380 The prohibited categories include a partner who is married or is in another relationship If he or she is a minor and if his or her consent was obtained by coercion fraud or misrepresentation the livein relationship will be illegal and punishable with imprisonment However such prohibitions will not apply to persons whose customary law permits the relationship provided that they are not against public policy or morality This is to exempt certain tribal communities in which livein relationships are the norm Following the Registrars inquiry the official will take a decision on the registration within 30 days of receiving the couples statement Should registration be refused reasons have to be conveyed in writing A woman in a livein relationship is also eligible to claim maintenance in case she is deserted by her livein partner The law also recognizes the legitimacy of children born out of a livein relationship In case couples who in a livein relationship do not submit their statement they will be served a notice following which criminal prosecution can be initiated against them If they have spent a month without submitting such a statement they can face a jail term of up to three months or a maximum fine of INR 10000 US 120 or both Any false statement by the couple will attract the same jail term and a higher fine of INR 25000 US 331 or both Upon being issued a notice by the Registrar if a partner still does not submit the statement of the livein relationship he or she may face six months of imprisonment or a fine of Rs 25000 US 331 or both Replication Fears Those who oppose the Uttarakhand law fear that it could be replicated by other State governments run by socially conservative parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP Uttarakhand is run by the BJP The Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju told Parliament that personal laws such as those covering marriage and divorce are under the Concurrent List of the constitution and therefore States can legislate on them The Uttarakhand law on livein relationships flies in the face of the Supreme Court ruling of March 2023 which dismissed a petition seeking a direction to the Central government to frame rules and guidelines to register livein partnerships Expressing strong disapproval of the relief sought a bench led by the Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud called it a harebrained idea Urban Phenomenon Livein relationships are not common in India and are not favoured either except among some tribal communities But an increasing number of urban educated young couples favour it either as a prelude to marriage to test mutual compatibility or as an escape from the obligations that go with marriage This is facilitated by the fact that the Supreme Court has recognised privacy as a fundamental right And sex between consenting couples is not a crime But the Uttarakhand law punishes livein relationships that are not registered with the government Those who object to the law say that it represents an intrusion by the state into the private lives of citizens The government has intruded into the bed room There is potential for moral policing harassment and government surveillance of private lives This is particularly worrying for intercaste and interfaith couples already targeted by Hindu vigilante groups and even the administration experts warned Many fear that the Uttarakhand law may drive away cohabiting couples encourage reporting on them and make landlords hesitant to rent to unregistered couples the BBC pointed out in one of its reports Now the state is stepping deeper into the nosy neighbourhood uncleaunty role said Nikita Sud Professor of the Politics of Development at the University of Oxford in an interview to Al Jazeera She pointed out that the intimate lives of Indians are often monitored by caste groups families parents landlords and residents associations All Indians should be asking what the State is doing in our bedrooms when it should be focusing on basics like food and agriculture employment healthcare our polluted and underresourced cities Sud said However the average Indian may tacitly approve the fetters on livein relationships A 2018 survey of over 160000 households quoted by the BBC found that 93 of married Indians reported having arranged marriages while only 3 had love marriages A May 2018 poll by Inshorts surveying 140000 netizens found that 80 of those aged between 18 and 35 viewed livein relationships as taboo But according to a 2023 survey by Lions GatePlay one out of two Indians felt that living together was important to understand their partner better This was a smaller survey conducted among 1000 Indians Indias courts have also frowned on livein relationships In 2012 a Delhi court deemed livein relationships immoral and dismissed them as an infamous product of Western culture labelling them a mere urban fad The Supreme Court has however been more supportive Situation in the US Pew Research in the US found that in November 2019 livein relationships were on the rise The share of adults between ages 18 and 44 who had ever lived with an unmarried partner was 59 This meant that quite a large number had experienced a livein relationship 78 of those between ages 18 and 29 said it was acceptable for an unmarried couple to live together even if they didnt plan to get married Even so a narrow majority said society would be better off if couples in longterm relationships eventually got married The survey found that married adults were more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who were cohabiting without being married Older adults were more likely to see societal benefits in marriage than young adults Still even among those younger than 30 a substantial share 45 said society would be better off if couples who wanted to stay together longterm eventually got married Views about marriage and cohabitation were also linked to religious affiliation Among those who were not religiously affiliated fully nineinten said cohabitation was acceptable even if a couple didnt plan to get married Those who had religious affiliations preferred marriage When asked about specific aspects of their relationship larger shares of married than cohabiting adults said they were very satisfied with the way household chores were divided between them Therefore even in the US where cohabitation outside marriage is being increasingly accepted marriage remains a preferred option"

        "body": "In 2015 Yanis Varoufakis was appointed Finance Minister of Greece by socialist Premier Alexis Tsipras The Euro debt crisis crippled Greece six months later giving the once popular Premier the stark choice of a painful IMF bailout or being forced to quit the EU and facing economic and diplomatic isolation An academic and Marxist by orientation Varoufakis vehemently opposed the IMF route insisting on finding a solution locally Initially Premier Tsipras backed him but opposition was overwhelming and he was forced to back down and opt for IMF Varoufakis quit in protest Unlike in Sri Lanka he didnt join the opposition or try to exploit the vacuum for personal gain A former academic who foresaw the banking crisis of 2008 he began writing provocative and insightful books analyzing how and where the world order went wrong Today he is hailed as one of the most radical daring and innovative thinkers around Hes not your dyedinthewool Marxist I find him fascinating because though I am not and have never been a follower of Karl Marx he is amazingly free of dogma is selfeffacing capable of selfcriticism as well as criticism of communisms icons and gods Admitting that we made huge mistakes he contradicts Lenin who said things will get worse before they get better He has charm a sense of humour and an objectivity in his analyses which raise them above the shackles of ideology and dogma He is also a humanist and one can see that people arent just numbers for him Speaking on the IsraeliPalestinian issue he says clearly that the roots of the problem go back to the historical European persecution of Jews Last year he took part in an online panel discussion of economists on Sri Lankas debt crisis There he flatly opposed going for an IMF bailout and one can see today that much of what he said about the IMF makes sense In a number of You Tube interviews notably with Aaron Bastani of Novara Media he talks about his latest book TechnoFeudalism End of Capitalism In Techno Feudalism Varoufakis presents a startling hypothesis the landowning feudalism which dominated Europe and much of the world before the 19th century before being replaced by industries as the Industrial Revolution checked the power of landowners and empowered a new industrial and business entrepreneurial class is back but in a new disguise Its digitalized and two of the examples given by Varoufakis would surprise many Amazoncom of the US and Chinas Ali Baba Both are huge but Varoufakis says they are not businesses They do not produce anything Instead they offer a platform for others to sell their products He calls them renteers a term used by economist David Ricardo in 1809 to describe landowning feudals They didnt produce anything but leased the land to make a large profit Amazon takes 40 when a product is sold on its platform This is akin to 18th century feudal renteering David Ricardo issued a warning During the Napoleonic wars when British corn prices went up as all imports were stopped the profits did not go to producers Part of it was siphoned off by landowning renteers who imposed higher rents on producers He warned that as these profits were not invested back into production by the producers the renteers were sleeping on that the result would be high inflation The world is facing a huge crisis not just with wars but with climate change health care online misinformation and increasing poverty and we need clear undogmatic thinkers as never before Varoufakis warns that the same thing is happening today the new technofeudal class which he calls cloud owners are siphoning off the profits and aggregate demand is shrinking as a result Their cloud capital is similar to what the feudal renteers had way back in 1809 To fuel consumer demand central banks start printing money sounds familiar and this fuels inflation Of course Central Banks cant do this by themselves They need political approval The post World War II British government of Clement Atlee introduced laws to keep the bankers in check But these were removed by Bill Clinton in the US and Tony Blair in the UK resulting in trillions worth of paper money being printed by central banks almost everywhere resulting in todays high inflation and social malaise Varoufakis notes that when the European Union was formed one condition imposed on all member states was that governments should destroy their printing presses so that local currencies could not be printed any more He says he doubts if Germany for example did this but Greece did If by chance Greece had opted to default its debts and leave the EU during the crisis the country could not have printed drachmas locally as the presses were gone But the Euro has not been able to challenge the US dollar The reason Varoufakis says is that Europes top industrialists prefer to do their banking with US dollars Europes economy is shrinking while the US dollars position in the markets is unshakable Only China dares to challenge that hegemony According to him todays world is run by algorithms All tech companies in the US China and elsewhere big or small use algorithms to create demand and thats why Elon Musk of Tesla wanted Twitter so badly now he has a huge database on Twitter users likes dislikes desires dreams whims and fancies These algorithms are designed to maximise outrage too The result is more outrage and bullshit jobs David Grey Bells as quoted by Varoufakis The more you prime outrage the more you extract money from the circular flow of income and a lot of economic energy is siphoned off as cloud rents by the new technofeudal class Varoufakis notes that this class is mainly American and Chinese Europe has no cloud techno class and is left out Volkswagen or Renault have no cloud capital He says the American ruling class made a deal with the Chinese Communist Party some time back shifting industries to China so that it could dominate the world with its Silicon Valley But things havent gone according to plan China is a big competitor in technofeudal cloud money making The new cold war is not over Taiwan or nukes says Varoufakis Its about algorithms Theres much more to Varoufakis than this and I wish to present readers with more thoughtprovoking arguments he comes up with in future columns The world is facing a huge crisis not just with wars but with climate change health care online misinformation and increasing poverty and we need clear undogmatic thinkers as never before"

Ranil Wickremesinghe appeared poised to accept the responsibility Sajith swiftly changed course making a hurried message to the Presidents House However his attempt was futile as he arrived too late to alter the unfolding events This pattern of tardiness and reactive decisionmaking has become characteristic of Sajiths leadership style The recurrent instances of him trailing behind rather than taking the lead have raised questions about his ability to provide decisive and proactive guidance The delay in seizing opportunities to lead and make critical decisions implies a lack of assertiveness and a propensity to follow rather than initiate The follower is always far behind the winner When faced with the opportunity to assume leadership in government Sajith Premadasa exhibited a hesitant approach His initial reluctance to take over the reins became evident creating a perception of indecisiveness Furthermore an apparent pattern has emerged in Sajith Premadasas political approach Over the past few months the National Peoples Power NPP actively sought to engage retired service personnel Intriguingly Sajith appears to be adopting a similar strategy reflecting the NPPs initiatives in this aspect A parallel trend is evident in his approach to the Indian leadership When Anura Kumara toured the subcontinent upon invitation Sajith also applied for a similar tour This inclination to emulate the actions of others rather than pioneering innovative strategies or leading independently raises concerns about Sajiths originality and his vision for the country In summary Sajith Premadasas leadership style is characterized by hesitancy reactive decisionmaking and a tendency to follow rather than lead The repeated instances of being late to seize opportunities and the apparent replication of strategies from other political entities raise questions about his competence originality and overarching vision for the future Sacrificing ethics at the altar of expediency is a tragic but timehonoured ritual R N Prasher The military in Sri Lanka continues to stand as one of the nations most trusted institutions enjoying widespread confidence among the public It distinguishes itself as one of the few entities perceived as free from overt political bias The unwavering trust placed in the military is indicative of its historic role as being a stabilizing force and protector of the nation transcending political affiliations This commendable reputation is not only a testament to the militarys commitment to professionalism and nonpartisanship but also reflects the crucial role it has played in safeguarding the countrys security and territorial integrity Amidst a backdrop of diverse political landscapes the militarys steadfast dedication to its constitutional duty has contributed significantly to its credibility among the Sri Lankan populace One can argue that retired officers share common rights and obligations with civilians allowing them to actively participate in partisan politics As time goes on weve started to see a clear difference between doing things because theyre practical expedient and doing things because theyre morally right This difference shows a kind of conflict where what makes sense in a practical way might not be the same as whats morally good and the other way around Its like realizing that whats helpful or smart to do might not always be the same as whats the right thing or vice versa One can argue that retired officers share common rights and obligations with civilians allowing them to actively participate in partisan politics Their valuable expertise and experience particularly in leadership and military capabilities make them valuable assets in government management roles However distinctions arise especially among the most senior officers as they bring unique mindsets and experiences to military oversight The ongoing debate questions whether meaningful differences exist between civilian and military preferences on policy issues The commencement of military involvement in politics is linked to Gotabaya During the 2019 Presidential campaign some Generals now affiliated with the SJB were seen campaigning for Gota while still in uniform After assuming the Presidency Gotabaya appointed several retired highranking officials to key positions within the administration The engagement of organized exmilitary personnel in political activities by both the NPPJVP and SJB raises concerns about setting a potentially perilous precedent As a result the militarys perceived lack of overt political bias serves as a source of reassurance for citizens fostering a sense of national unity and confidence in the countrys institutions This unique position places the military in a pivotal role not only in maintaining security but also in upholding the publics faith in the principles of democracy and civilian governance In times of political uncertainty or transition the militarys commitment to remaining apolitical becomes increasingly significant It serves as a stabilizing force offering continuity and a sense of assurance to the public which looks to the armed forces as a symbol of national unity and resilience In summary the enduring trust that the people of Sri Lanka place in their military is grounded in its reputation for impartiality and dedication to its constitutional duties In times of political uncertainty or transition the militarys commitment to remaining apolitical becomes increasingly significant This trust underscores the militarys pivotal role as a respected and unbiased institution contributing to the overall stability and confidence in the nations democratic processes Amendments to military ordinances are essential to introduce regulations wherein officers aspiring to become Generals or Admirals commit as part of their employment contract to refrain from endorsing partisan candidates for a specified period of postretirement The controversy surrounding recent political statements and endorsements by retired General and flag officers spark debates on the militarys nonpartisanship norm A unique survey of retired flag officers reveals consensus on the norm against partisan speech but notable divergence on its applicability and justifications for violating it Despite ongoing debates there remains a limited understanding of how retired officers particularly senior ones perceive publicly commenting on political matters Retired military leaders vary in interpreting the noninvolvement norm its boundaries and the justifiability of violating it Despite acknowledging social pressures their decisions to speak out are primarily driven by personal assessments rather than external influences While scholars widely agree that certain actions by retired senior officers are considered inappropriate there is noticeable variation among officers regarding behaviours aligned with their professional obligations Retired military leaders exhibit diversity in their perceptions of their connection to politics political engagement and the boundaries of the noninvolvement norm in partisan politics By documenting these diverse viewpoints we contribute nuance to the ongoing debate about political and partisan behaviours within civilmilitary relations The writer can be contacted on kksperera1gmailcom"

indicated a rapid progress in the popularity of the NPP In case the election results and the opinion polls coincide the NPP has to deal with India as India has already chosen economic interests in the Trincomalee oil tank farm Mannar wind power project Sampur power plant and many more which the NPP does not agree with When Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa criticized the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP citing a clause in the latters Policy Declaration published in 1977 about confiscating means of production belonged to private institutions the leader of the JVP and the National Peoples Power NPP Anura Kumara Dissanayake advised him to get himself updated as it was a document published about half a century ago when there was a socialist bloc of countries in the world He might tell almost the same to those who now remind of the JVPs old theory Indian Expansionism against the backdrop of the NPP leaders visit to the Indian Capital on an invitation by the Indian Government this week The JVP is a party that indoctrinates its new members with a series of lectures which they call classes and one of the five classes that were conducted before the partys first insurrection in 1971 had been named Indian Expansionism The general idea of the class was that India has a policy of swallowing smaller countries around it in the long run They cited Sikkim a onetime Buddhist Kingdom becoming a protectorate of India in 1950 as a case in point Sikkim later in 1975 became the 22nd state of the Union of India Many seem to recall this now to find it in contradiction with the JVPs current relationship with India Yet the party was not the authors of this theory It was the then Chinese Communist Party CPC that had developed it All parties that toed the line of the CPC in the region then including the JVP accepted and propagated it However JVP leaders who had been imprisoned subsequent to the brutal suppression of their insurrection in 1971 went through an ideological transformation during their incarceration and moved to a middle point between Maoism which they followed till then and Trotskyism This and the allegation that the JVP propagated antiTamil rhetoric through the lecture Indian Expansionism pressed the party leaders to drop the idea by 1972 and another highly theoretical class the Role of the Revolution replaced it Therefore people who remind the JVP of Indian Expansionism now have to get themselves updated as Dissanayake advised the Opposition Leader There was a time after that when the JVP was in fact defending the regional interests of India deeming it as a strong ally of the socialist bloc In 1984 after the party was unfairly proscribed and sent underground by the United National Party UNP government in July 1983 JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera in a Q A document which the party described as an interview by an anonymous foreign journalist with its leader accused President JR Jayewardene who was once called Yankee Dicky for assisting the US to encircle India which is already flanked by two more US allies Pakistan and Bangladesh Nevertheless the notion that the JVP is an antiIndian party is deep rooted among the Sri Lankans especially due to its violent opposition to the IndoSri Lanka Accord of 1987 and the resultant provincial councils system However the party was not consistently an antiIndian party The relationship between the two has been having its ups and downs The party which viewed the northern neighbour as a friend in the early eighties used the provisions of the IndoLanka Accord and the deployment of Indian troops in Sri Lanka to whip up antiIndian feelings among Sri Lankans and thereby wage a longdrawnout guerrilla war against the state The Deshapremi Janatha Vyaparaya DJV the JVPs military wing in 1989 launched armed attacks against the Indian forces which were then officially called the Indian Peace Keeping Force IPKF Kumar Gunaratnam the current leader of the Frontline Socialist Party FSP was said to have been assigned with this task This second JVP insurrection ended in November 1989 with the decimation of all but one member of the Partys Politbureau Somawansa Amarasinghe who so escaped death fled to Britain ironically through India The irony is so vivid when Amarasinghe after a 12year exile returned to the country in another November in 2001 as the successor of Wijeweera to thank Indian authorities including former Indian Prime Minister VP Singh at a massive rally in his home town Kalutara for helping him to leave the country defying death No doubt India invited the NPP leaders for the current visit a privilege that was not awarded even to the official Opposition in Parliament on the premise that the party is going to form the next government The outcomes of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Institute of Health Policy IHP since late 2022 which have not been challenged yet even by the ruling parties indicated a rapid progress in the popularity of the NPP The latest Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey SLOTS by the IHP in December last year showed Anura Kumara Dissanayake surpassing the Constitutional benchmark of 50 at a future Presidential election His closest rival Sajith Premadasa had scored only 33 percent of public preference This seems to have prompted not only India but several other powerful countries to approach the party US Ambassador Julie Chung who had met the NPP leaders during the early days of the Aragalaya visited the JVP office in Pelawatta again on October 20 last year which was followed by a meeting between former Indian High Commissioner Gopal Baglay and the NPP leaders on November 17 at the Indian High Commission Representatives of the International Monetary Fund IMF visited the JVP office on January 19 this year as a part of their efforts to study views of various parties in the country New Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha and German Ambassador Dr Felix Neumann also met the NPP leaders on January 23 and 31 respectively However the New Delhi visit by the NPP leaders especially on an invitation by the Indian government and the itinerary of the visit which included meetings with highest level authorities of the country such as the External Minister Dr S Jaishankar Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval seem to have sent shock waves across the main political parties It prompted them to ridicule the NPP recalling the Indian Expansionism and the attack on the IPKF which the JVP then called Monkey Force Even NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa who as a former JVP stalwart very well knows that the party has never and nowhere used the term Indian Expansionism since 1972 had questioned the visit on the same ground However predicting election results through opinion polls is not so prudent always in a highly corrupt country at a time when the Executive gives its own interpretations to the Constitutions Yet in case the election results and the opinion polls coincide the NPP has to meet an India with the same ups and downs in relationship as India has already chosen economic interests in the Trincomalee oil tank farm Mannar wind power project Sampur power plant and many more which the NPP does not agree with Only time will tell how competent the party is in diplomacy not as an opposition party but as a ruling party"

Tigers to attack the Navatkuli Army Camp on Valentines Day went awry due to the accidental explosion that killed 43 and injured 51 persons Prabakaran wanted his cadres to redraw plans and attack Navatkuli again But while preparations were in progress the soldiers expanded the camp area further by taking over the Andriesz factory and the Thamby Walavu Coconut grove The water problem faced by the Army was solved The Hhour struck The water bowser was substituted and then filled with water at Kaithady but the Tigers found to their dismay that in spite of their elaborate preparations they had neglected one aspect They had not tried filling their duplicate bowser with water prior to the actual switching of both When the water was filled the outer pipes of the explosive laden bowser began leaking When Ponnamman reached the scene he found the pipes leaking He and Ranjan decided to fix it with a blow torch welder The welding began on the outside while the explosives were in the secret compartment on the inside Curdles Vasu Paran and others also gathered around those engaged in welding The time was between 520 and 525 pm Suddenly there was a powerful blast The bowser exploded The explosion expected at Navatkuli went off by accident in Kaithady All hell broke loose The exact reason for the explosion is unknown even today although it is surmised that the heat generated by the welding process may have been the cause The armed forces became aware of the situation and a helicopter assault was launched on the withdrawing cadres The best laid schemes of mice and men often go awry penned the Scottish bard Robert Burns in his poem To A Mouse This truth was brought home in an explosive manner to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE 37 years ago when a massive explosion rocked the Kaithady area in the Thenmaratchi division of the Jaffna peninsula A welllaid plan by the LTTE known popularly as the Tigers to attack the Navatkuli Army Camp on Valentines Day went awry due to the accidental explosion that killed 43 and injured 51 persons 14 February 1987 remains an explosive date in the annals of contemporary military history and is worthy of being recounted as its 34thanniversary draws near What happened then was this The war between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE was continuing LTTE leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran gave the slip to Indian authorities and clandestinely returned to Jaffna from Tamil Nadu on 5 January 1987 To mark his return the Tiger supremo wanted his men to expedite a bold attack being planned against a Sri Lankan Army camp in the North Navatkuli Camp The army camp at Navatkuli was set up in the 198485 period along the JaffnaKandy road near the lagoon It had around 300 to 400 security personnel The Ceygma Company factory which specialised in manufacturing water pumps and pipes had been acquired by the state for this purpose At the time the camp was set up the military installation was not selfsufficient in drinking water If premises belonging to the adjoining Andriesz Seafood Processing Factory or the adjacent Thamby Walavu coconut grove had also been acquired then drinking water could have been available but it was not done initially Instead a Tamil civilian from the neighbouring village Kaithadi was contracted to supply water to the camp This man would haul a water bowser attached to his tractor every morning and evening and fill it up with good drinking water at a well in Kaithady He would then deliver it routinely to the Navatkuli camp Thileepan alias Curdles The LTTE commander for Jaffna district in 1987 was Sathasivampillai Krishnakumar alias Kittu The Thenmaratchi divisional area commander was Thileepan alias Curdles aka Curdy Curdles was entrusted with the task of preparing a feasibility study on attacking the Kaithady camp He was in the process of planning the attack when the LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabakharan relocated to Jaffna from India Prabakharan was very keen that the hitherto defensive war should be transformed to offensive status So he instructed Kittu to prioritise the attack on Navatkuli Since the NavatkuliKaithady areas were part of Thenmaratchy and therefore technically under Curdles Kittu ordered him to draw up the initial plan of action Later it was personally streamlined by Kittu The LTTE obtained maps and plans of the Ceygma factory premises from a construction contracting firm in Jaffna and made elaborate plans including the setting up of a model replica Also heavy reconnaissance known in LTTE parlance as rekki was also conducted Since LTTE sentries were posted around the camp earlier the presence of LTTE rekki scouts did not arouse the suspicion of the army camp Water Bowser Driver Another unexpected bonanza to the Tigers was the willing cooperation of the water bowser driver The man was apparently an ardent Tamil nationalist and a genuine supporter of the Tigers He was prepared to go to any length to help the LTTE and proved to be a useful accomplice Through his assistance the LTTE photographed the water bowser in minute detail and started work on the project It was decided to build an exact replica of the water bowser at a secret site in Meesalai Ranjan a nonLTTE civilian engineer who had collaborated earlier with Ideas Vasu on an aircraft project was in charge He was assisted by Yogaratnam Kugan alias Ponnamman in this respect Although Ponnamman was then technically the Mullaitheevu district commander Prabakharan personally assigned Ponnamman also known as Atputhanto to work on this project The duplicate water bowser was to have a false bottom in which explosives were to be placed Since the army sentries had got used to the reliable tractor driver and his water bowser intensive search was not anticipated Explosiveladen Bowser The plan was to substitute the explosiveladen bowser for the original with the connivance of the driver To avoid suspicion the duplicate bowser was constructed almost as an exact replica of the original with the appropriate shade of blue paint water marks signs of corrosion etc The day of attack was scheduled for Feb 14th 1987 a Saturday In those days the LTTE had a penchant to launch major attacks on a numerological basis The 5th 14th and 23rd were good days while the 8th 17th and 26th were bad days The duplicate bowser was surreptitiously transported in the early hours of the 13th a Friday to a granary at Kaithady There the false bottom was loaded with explosives along with proportionate booster charges This was personally undertaken by Ponnamman the resident LTTE expert at that time in explosive technology The plan was for the driver to bring the original bowser to this granary where it would be substituted with the explosive laden duplicate bowser filled with water and taken to the Navatkuli camp The attack was to begin with the explosion of the water bowser between 530pm and 6pm In the meantime the carefully drawn up attack plan was being executed with exact precision by the Tigers Cadres from all over the Jaffna peninsula and Mannar were transported on 13th night in small groups to abandoned houses at Navatkuli They were ordered to remain hidden throughout daylight on the 14th Action Plan The action plan was drawn up with meticulous detail The driver was to enter the camp with the water bowser and then walk away towards the toilet without attracting attention When he reached a safe distance the explosion was to be triggered off through remote control In case the remote did not work a timer too had been fitted on as a precautionary measure The LTTE spokesman of the time Rahim was stationed at the top of the adjoining Andriesz factory airconditioning plant It was a vantage point to obtain a birds eye view of what was happening in the camp When the driver was clear Rahim was to signal another senior cadre Ravi who was to press the plunger Once Ravi triggered the explosion at Rahims signal the attack was to commence It was expected that the whole Navatkuli camp would be thrown into confusion and disarray by the explosion A group led by Uthaman was to assault the gates with the extensive use of Bangalore Torpedoes Uthamans group would clear frontal defensive mines Four sandbag laden trucks with mounted firearms were to penetrate the outer defences and enter the camp frontally from different points Each truck was at the vanguard of four different Tiger groups on foot The four groups were led by Curdles Johnny Soosai and Paran respectively At that time Curdles was LTTE leader of the Thenmaratchi division Johnny the Valigamam division Soosai the Vadamaratchi division and Paran the deputyleader of Prabakharans body guard squad Each leader was perched on each of the advancing trucks Two groups led by Vasu and Kutti Sri were to conduct mortar fire from two directions Veeman was in charge of the group assigned to provide covering fire with small arms Six groups led by Ravi Malaravan Mathan Rahim Kandeepan and Mayooran respectively were to breach the defences at six points on three sides and enter the camp fighting A cutout to prevent military reinforcements by air was established towards the Ariyalai direction under the command of Daniel This cutout was equipped with 50 calibre guns then the most powerful in the LTTE arsenal 180 LTTE guerrillas comprising assault and support cadres were to be involved in the operation The operational headquarters was at a house near the KaithadyKopay road The person in charge was Kunju the deputy leader of the Thenmaratchi area but Kittu the overall Jaffna commander also stationed himself there Prabakharan was at Valvettithurai then Leaking Pipes The Hhour struck The water bowser was substituted and then filled with water at Kaithady but the Tigers found to their dismay that in spite of their elaborate preparations they had neglected one aspect They had not tried filling their duplicate bowser with water prior to the actual switching of both When the water was filled the outer pipes of the explosive laden bowser began leaking News of the leaking pipes did not reach all the leaders and group leaders as only an uncommon frequency was used to inform Ponnamman and Ranjan the engineer They raced to the scene in a pickup vehicle Three other Tiger leaders Vasu Curdles and Paran also heard about the leaking pipes and proceeded to Kaithady with some of their cadres As was customary LTTE battle practice a separate frequency was being used in the combat zone Kittu also was using it Some walkietalkies had switched frequencies while others had not That is why some leaders heard about the leaking pipes and others did not The others did not know what was happening and were waiting in their positions for the signal to attack Rahim for example had detained the evening shift employees at Andriesz factory in a safe place so that they would not get caught up in the attack Residents of Navatkuli who strayed into the combat zone were also detained in this manner Blowtorch Welder When Ponnamman reached the scene he found the pipes leaking He and Ranjan decided to fix it with a blow torch welder The welding began on the outside while the explosives were in the secret compartment on the inside Curdles Vasu Paran and others also gathered around those engaged in welding The time was between 520 and 525 pm Suddenly there was a powerful blast The bowser exploded The explosion expected at Navatkuli went off by accident in Kaithady All hell broke loose 43 Killed51 Injured 12 LTTE cadres and 31 civilians were killed 51 persons comprising civilians and LTTE cadres were injured Those waiting at the Navatkuli battlefront heard the explosion report and wondered what happened The explosion was powerful enough to rattle the windows of the Kailasapathy Hall at the Jaffna University at Thirunelveli The exact reason for the explosion is unknown even today although it is surmised that the heat generated by the welding process may have been the cause Among those killed were Lt Col Kugan alias Ponnamman the Mullaitheevu commander and a favourite of Prabakharan The Thenmaratchy leader Major Curdles was also killed Sudhagaran alias Vasu known as Ideas Vasu was also killed Apart from Capt Vasu Lt Paran and Lt Siddarthan the younger brother of Sornalingam alias Shankar the Chief of the AirTigers wing was also killed Among the civilians killed were Ranjan the engineer and the water bowser driver The body of Ponnamman was blown to bits and nothing was recovered Curdles was identified by parts of a belt Vasu was identified through a piece of an identity card Curdles had a premonition that he was going to die in the Navatkuli attack He left behind a letter written to Kittu He had also made entries in his diary to that effect But Curdles never expected death by explosion and it is said that the hardboiled Kittu cried when reading Curdys last epistle Aruna another senior leader was despatched with the unenviable task of breaking the news to the LTTE supremo Prabakharan in Valvettithurai Kittu who visited the scene of the explosion almost broke down and it was left to Radha another senior leader to call off the operation Couriers were dispatched to the attack groups who began withdrawing The armed forces became aware of the situation and a helicopter assault was launched on the withdrawing cadres The LTTE retaliated with ground to air fire Prabakaran wanted his cadres to redraw plans and attack Navatkuli again But while preparations were in progress the soldiers expanded the camp area further by taking over the Andriesz factory and the Thamby Walavu Coconut grove The water problem faced by the Army was solved Separate funerals and Jaffnawide memorial meetings were conducted in honour of the dead persons The LTTE was the darling of the Jaffna masses then and all Jaffna overtly mourned the victims of the Kaithady bowser explosion Conversations with Tigers I conclude by stating that most of the information used in this article was obtained through conversations with exJaffna LTTE commander Kittu and three other extigers involved in the abortive Kaithady operation DBS

Palestine by the art platform Creative Debuts AFP Do as I say not as I do This is the mantra with which the imperialist West keeps its colonial or neocolonial projects going This duplicity is also evident in the imperialists media policy Often developing countries midcareer journalists are invited to the West for training that lasts weeks months and even a year The institutes to which they go meet the airfare accommodation and meal costs They are even paid per diem They are lectured on journalistic rules and dos and donts They are taught that journalisms first obligation is to the truth which is sacred and cannot be warped or violated The primary duty of the journalist is to find out the truth verify it factcheck it and convey it to the people they are morally bound to serve Journalists should be impartial independent and unbiased and whatever they write should be in the public interest We journalists were taught that news has many sides Every stakeholders viewpoint should be presented We were asked to adhere to journalistic ethics and warned that misusing journalism to promote personal interests or settle scores with a person a group or even a country was not journalism We were elated when journalists were described as the fourth estate of democracy the watchdog and the voice of the voiceless But all these hallowed principles that Western institutes teach developing countries journalists are flouted by some Western journalists serving the interests of the imperial West This is not to discount the great journalistic endeavours of some Western journalists Among these great names is Seymour Hearst who revealed to the world the US war crimes in the My Lai village during the Vietnam War in 1969 and the torture of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail in 2004 Then there are Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein whose expos on the Watergate scandal forced thenUS President Richard Nixon to resign In separate investigative work Bernstein revealed that the US establishment had hired journalists to work as spies John Pilger who passed away recently was another journalistic great With his courageous documentaries he exposed what the imperialist forces did not want the people to know However some mainstream Western media outlets which people still regard as the epitome of good journalism practise the art of deception instead of truthtelling journalism Their slip is showingor their shame is exposedin their coverage of the Gaza war Last week Britains Guardian newspaper carried a shocking report about CNN which reaches out to people with catchy slogans such as The worldwide leader in the news and the most trusted name in the news The Guardian headline said it all CNN staff say networks proIsrael slant amounts to journalistic malpractice The strapline read Insiders say pressure from the top results in credulous reporting of Israeli claims and silencing of Palestinian perspectives The articles first two paragraphs say CNN is facing a backlash from its own staff over editorial policies they say have led to a regurgitation of Israeli propaganda and the censoring of Palestinian perspectives in the networks coverage of the war in Gaza Journalists in CNN newsrooms in the US and overseas say broadcasts have been skewed by management edicts and a storyapproval process that has resulted in highly partial coverage of the Hamas massacre on 7 October and Israels retaliatory attack on Gaza Apart from the management edicts to warp news from the Gaza Strip the article also reveals that all PalestinianIsraelirelated news is vetted by CNNs Jerusalem bureau This is not journalism This is embedded journalism of the worst order If embedded journalism is to be defined it is nothing but prostituting journalism and producing bastardised news CNN the BBC Sky News ITV and several other big names practise selective journalism designed to show Israel as the victim and the colonised Palestinians as aggressors Craftily edited videos and the choice of words are the sleight of hand that they use to perpetrate their deceptions under the pretext of providing fair and accurate news These media outlets journalists are not even present in Gaza Thanks to brave journalists from AlJazeera and a handful of news organisations and socialmediabased citizen journalists the world sees live the full scale of Israels genocide campaign in which more than 100 journalists have been killed Years ago awardwinning journalist John Pilger wrote an article recalling a 20year BBC ban on journalist Peter Watkins thoughtprovoking film The War Game The BBC said the film which was about the nuclear catastrophe was too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting But Pilger reveals that the BBC and Whitehall felt that the film would create a public outcry against nuclear weapons In a secret note the then BBC chairman Lord Normanbrook says the film is not designed as propaganda and the showing of the film on television might have a significant effect on public attitudes towards the policy of the nuclear deterrent Writing this article during Israels 2012 war on Gaza Pilger says Israel has successfully intimidated the BBC into presenting the theft of Palestinian land and the caging torturing and killing of its people as an intractable conflict between equals He says that so effective is the BBC distortion that young viewers of BBC News have told Glasgow University researchers they are left with the impression that Palestinians are the illegal colonisers of their own country The BBCs perceived independence comes with a political price Pilger notes Citing historian Patrick Renshaw Pilger says Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin in the 1920s saw that if they preserved the BBCs independence it would be much easier for them to get their way on important questions and use it to broadcast government propaganda The Zionist lobby has a big influence on the US and Western media which in turn programmes the peoples minds to see white as black justice as injustice and resistance as terrorism This is not journalism This is information terrorism Misinformation cultivates antiPalestinian hatred which in turn produces state terrorism by Israel and its Western allies The very Western governments that preach to us about freedom of expression are the biggest oppressors of free speech Leave aside antiSemitismrelated free speech censorship but what will explain their witch hunt against WikiLeaks cofounder Julian Assange His case proves that the West allows free speech only as long as it does not violate imperial interests Under Assanges watch WikiLeaks became an outlet for whistleblowers who were disturbed by the criminal acts of their governments The Zionists and their imperialist Western partners have also to a great extent succeeded in taming the social media giants X owner Elon Musk converted to Zionism after his recent visit to Israel while Facebook and Instagram cooperate with the war party in vetting antiIsraeli content The Chineseowned TikTok which is under pressure in the West for being a spy tool for Beijing is listening to Israels diktats after a recent meeting with Zionist authorities Even AI tools such as Copilot ChatGPT and Google Bard have been programmed not to answer proPalestinian questions In the absence of agendafree factbased and valuedriven global media which the Global South envisioned during the heydays of the NonAligned Movement under the theme New World Information and Communication Order NWICO people as news consumers

of America On the surface it could amount to be an invitation to test the psyche of a political party that has the potential to win an election but might not know what to do with extreme power that comes its way when it forms a government There was a time when people in this island nation feared the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP That was a time known as the insurgency We saw the worst of this insurgency in the late 1980s and this was a time when there was an Indian Peace Keeping Force in this island sent here to help the Sri Lankan security forces in the fight against terrorism Fast forward the clock to 2024 and now the JVP has grown to form an alliance National Peoples Power with several other groups and is even recognized as a force in the political scene by neighbouring India Critics might even be bold to state that India is concerned about the rise of this JVP led National Peoples Power NPP which is registered with the Elections Commission of Sri Lanka as a political party Just recently NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and a delegation representing the alliance visited India on an invitation extended by New Delhi to talk on matters common to both India and Sri

Delhi cannot forget that history so easily We remember just after the Indo Lanka Accord was signed in 1987 how this nation started burning at both ends the north due to the civil war and the south because of the insurgency The JVP started calling all people who didnt support its cause traitors and even issued an ultimatum to the state security forces to quit service and stop supporting the then regime India landing the Indian Peace Keeping Force here didnt help Sri Lankas cause in fighting terrorism it just dumped another load of problems on the Government of Sri Lanka The then JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera termed the IndoLanka Accord as the Second Upcountry Pact the First Upcountry Pact was signed between Kandy Chieftains and the British colonizers paving the way for the British Crown to officially take over this nation Wijeweera also termed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE as the fifth battalion of the Indian Government A detailed account of Wijeweeras thoughts on Indias interference in Sri Lanka was penned by writer Udeni Saman Kumara and appeared in the Mawbima newspaper in its edition published on August 4 2019 Wijeweera wanted the removal of the elected Executive President an unlawfully elected Cabinet and the Local Government authorities set up around the country at that time which were not opposing a regime that signed the IndoLanka Accord India has since the era of our kings and continuing to the time when ushering in an elected Parliament been interested in Sri Lanka on the above mentioned three aspects There are political reminiscences from the past which reveal that Sri Lanka through two males connected to a highprofile familyrun political party had discussions with then Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka JN Dixit to bring in Sirimavo

That is the volatile nature of Sri Lankan politics when it comes to dealing with India One good thing about the JVP like with the majority of the people of this country is that it has short memories The JVP has now fully forgotten about Wijeweera who formed this revolutionary party But it is pertinent here to mention that Wijeweera always warned that Sri Lanka cannot break free of Indias clutches The founder of the JVP underscored the importance of studying the details in the national flags and the state symbols of these two South Asian nations He had observed the Dharmachakra Buddhist symbol present in the Indian national flag and also in the state emblem of Sri Lanka He had also observed the figure of the Lion present in the national flag of Sri Lanka and also in the state emblem of India Sound thinking if applied here will reveal that these two symbols common to both nations and appearing differently in their national flags and state emblems suggest that Wijeweera saw far and wide that Indias political winds would decide the course on which the political ship of Sri Lanka will manoeuvre"

mitigate conflict between villagersfarmers and elephants Elephants are frequently at the receiving end of the everaggravating humanelephant conflict HEC that was created more than 5060 years ago when people moved into elephant territory sans any assessment The WNPS experimented on a Light Repel System LRS for the past three years which has yielded satisfactory results in 6 districts at 24 locations The discovery of an elephant carcass in Giribawa on February 6 raised the total count of elephant deaths to 21 for this year In 2023 Sri Lanka made history as the country with the highest number of elephant deaths hitting a record high of 400 or more Elephants are frequently at the receiving end of the everaggravating humanelephant conflict HEC that was created more than 5060 years ago when people moved into elephant territory sans any assessment As a result people are more worried about their paddy lands and vegetable plots and would go to any extent to keep the elephants away But what they fail to understand is that they have constructed their houses along elephant corridors or near forest reserves which are home to elephants HEC in the North Central Province The North Central Province is one of the worstaffected areas by the HEC Most elephants succumb to gunshot injuries while some elephants are subject to illegal electrocution Others collide with speeding trains In September last year within a span of 36 hours eleven elephants succumbed to injuries as a result of elephanttrain collisions But no practical solution has been implemented to mitigate this situation Haphazard encroachment activities have kept people and elephants at war The HEC has claimed the lives of at least 176 people in 2023 As more humans are being killed people fear to coexist with elephants A common notion is that elephant fences and other solutions may not work anymore There have to be orders given from above for the Department of Wildlife Conservation DWC to provide a lasting solution for the HEC opined R M J Bandara a resident from Galgamuwa Bandara has been working at the grassroots level raising awareness on the HEC for many years He observes how illegal constructions along elephant corridors environmentally sensitive areas and forest reserves have pushed more elephant herds to raid villages and cause irreversible damages to property and vegetation Elephants travel long distances in search of water and food We have seen how elephant herds in Palukadawala Lake reserve now frequent smaller lakes such as the Ambakola Wewa when water levels in bigger lakes go down They travel to the Kala Wewa via the KahallaPallekele forest reserve towards the Inginimitiya Wewa Thabbowa all the way up to Wilpattu Hence when their usual migratory path has been disturbed they will seek alternatives Bandara added Efforts by WNPS to Mitigate HEC As a leading conservation organization in the country the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society believes that no single mitigative method will solve the problem of the Human Elephant Conflict All stakeholders must gather and work in unison to reduce the stress levels of both the farmer and the elephant WNPS President Jehan CanagaRetna A mindset change of how the farmer sees the elephant and if we can change their minds to make an earning from the elephant will solve a lot of our HEC issues in the future The WNPS experimented on a Light Repel System LRS for the past three years which has yielded satisfactory results in 6 districts at 24 locations Currently we have an 82 efficacy rate for the LRS We are in the process of compiling a white paper so that we can publish the results and pass on the concept to the government as another effective tool for conflict mitigation The WNPS has supported the Presidential Committee headed by former Director General of Wildlife Conservation Dr Sumith Pilapitiya to monitor the progress of the implementation of the National Action Plan for the Mitigation of the HumanElephant Conflict by implementing pilot projects in erecting protective fencing around villages as well as agricultural cultivations This is a concept of Dr Prithiviraj Fernando who has been experimenting with it in two Districts with more than 500 farmers benefiting from it The idea is to fence the village in and keep the jungle free for the elephants to roam their traditional ranges The WNPS is also working on legal proceedings that bring about landmark judgements against perpetrators of elephant killings For good reason we cannot publicly outline the details We are also working on a method of engaging with villagers trying to implore them to see the elephant in a different light with the priority of making them understand that humans and elephants can coexist We are trying this out in the Anuradhapura District and we hope to publish our results within 2 years We have individuals who are on WNPS pay roll that live in hamlets and are going through the problem with the villagers to come up with the best solution There is no better way than experiencing the stress by living with farmers and understanding the situation first hand CanagaRetna added Work continues with farmer communities to provide them with immediate assistance to make their lives less stressful and thereby make the elephants lives less stressful too In collaboration with the Elephant Transit Home ETH of the Department of Wildlife Conservation DWC and the Ragama Campus of the University of Kelaniya the team has conducted research on an antibiotic study to understand the resistance levels of elephants in the wild in captivity and elephants in the wild who feed on garbage dumps We are also experimenting with a collar system again working with the ETH of the DWC to understand if we can use this collar to provide an early warning system to mitigate conflict between villagersfarmers and elephants This experiment is currently taking place but it will not be until the end of 2024 before we can assess how successful it has been he said in conclusion Will The Numbers Come Down In December 2023 the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment Natural Resources and Sustainable Development presented the National Action Plan for reducing HumanElephant Conflicts The committee was chaired by Senior Elephant Researcher Dr Sumith Pilapitiya In their presentation the Committee pointed out that wild elephants have spread across 62 of the countrys landscape and that the construction of communityled electric fences is the most viable solution to minimize the HEC But even though electric fences seem to be the most viable solution many elephants succumb to illegal electrocution As a result DWC officials are now conducting a survey to ensure that private electric fences have direct current instead of alternating current We dont have adequate technical staff but we are now working in different zones to educate people on constructing standard electric fences said DWC Director General M G C Sooriyabandara The DWC has put up electric fences in certain areas and people should ideally take these fences as an example When asked about the rise in elephanttrain collisions Sooriyabandara said that there doesnt seem to be any increase but several elephants succumbed to injuries within a span of a few days in 2023 We found that these incidents are likely to occur in places where new railway tracks have been laid or when trains run behind schedule We have deployed our officials to clear the thick shrub growing on either side of railway tracks to minimize elephanttrain collisions Sooriyabandara further said that a collaborative approach among stakeholder institutions would help provide more feasible solutions to minimize HEC Already the Department of Agrarian Development has started putting up fences around plots of agriculture in areas with a heavy HEC The Railway Department is working on a plan to minimize accidents This way going forward we hope to bring down the number of elephants as well as human deaths"

conviction in the nation UNP has seen an erosion in its confidence and we have reestablish that in the best possible way President Ranil Wickremesinghe is proposing a daring new system that is adventurous Some 18 months ago you were without electricity gas and fuel I think people should not forget about all these Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake in an interview with the Daily Mirror said that he is still actively involved in politics and hopes to make his contributions to put the debtridden country back on the right path He also spoke of reinventing the party using the experienced hands and also by bringing in new faces He added that moves are underway to restore peoples confidence in the UNP Excerpts of the interview Q Are you engaged in active politics now What have you focused on these days Yes I am actively involved in making national development I can see that there is a dearth of professionalism in the country I can see the necessity of getting the country back onto the right path and it is the need of the hour Q How are you getting about with this task of nation building At the end of the day the necessity is for a dynamic result oriented leader for the country We need someone who can give guidance so that the nation is able to move on an innovative direction The country is confronted with too much of hearsay and prophesies which have led to the downfall of the government Now is the time that a nation building exercise has to take place There are no people with courageous and conviction in the nation I am talking about politicians There are no statesmen in this country My intention is to address these issues Q We have heard that there would be changes to the UNP There is going to be a leadership board You are also part of it Also there are reports that you are to be appointed as the General Secretary of UNP Is that correct I will refrain from answering that question At the moment we are doing a complete reinvention of the party using the experienced hands and those of the knowledgeable and also by bringing in new faces The UNP has seen an erosion in its confidence and we have reestablished that in the best possible way so that we UNP will be accepted by the people QMany UNPers who had left the party have joined SJB Any possibility of getting them back We are looking at that from a broader perspective It is not people who leave us during elections and come back who are important We are looking at a longhaul nation building process In that exercise similar thinking people will come together You will see that happening Narrow minded people who dont exercise forward thinking who are only interested in the next elections dont have a great future We are an old party which is looking at a broad confidence building exercise to reestablish ourselves as a deliverable party which the country sadly lacks We are focusing on daring innovative ways to take Sri Lanka to the world like the late President J R Jayewardene did in 1977 QWhat do you think of the current status of the countrys economy They say taxes are too high What is your opinion I agree with the thinking of people It is true I am disappointed with the government servants who cannot think neatly They take the passage of easiness They should think of what is best for the nation I think it is necessary to embrace a Sri Lankan solution for a problem created by the Sri Lankans We dont need a foreign player to answer our problems I am a believer that we have the talent and the ability and the will We lack conviction and political ability to carry things forward President Ranil Wickremesinghe is proposing a daring new system that is adventurous There is no way out except that process which he proposes QWhat are your thoughts about Sri Lanka obtaining assistance from the IMF The IMF is not a palatal solution However Sri Lanka needs to do what is needed whether the IMF tells us to do anything or not QWhere do you think the countrys economy stands at present Do you think it is in the process of recovering The economy experienced an unwarranted passage not by choice and not by chance We had the COVID issue There were obvious issues and they were omitted and that is where the problem arose We in 2015 inherited an economy where its GDP recorded a revenue growth of 82 percent We increased it up to 15 percent in 2017 There were only 200000 tax files We increased it to more than 15 million In 2020 it was reduced to 200000 tax files once again The revenue went down to 8 percent of GDP once again as a result There was a Rs 750 billion loss in revenue It was a political decision and it was hoped that there will be investment with growth content That should have been balanced with professionalism You need professionals who are practical to make day to day decisions Q Do you think the countrys economy has stabilised No it is still progressing towards stability Some 18 months ago you were without electricity gas and fuel I think people should not forget about all these People should remember that things have changed The reason for this is being silent When you remain silent Rs 750 billion was written off That is where the issue is Central Bank created the situation and is asking the people to pay 30 percent tax A retrospective answer for the tax issue will not work Q When do you think the country would return to stability It will be after a passage of time There are 23 million people and more than 5 million families in the country The concept of working for the betterment of the country will ensure a quick return to stability We are highly over regulated These are the two factors government servants and politicians must work on No one knows who is responsible There should be public servants not parrot servants Today decision making takes time It is not possible to attract local investors We live as if the world lives inside Sri Lanka This is the issue We are an island stricken with poverty but on an ocean of prosperity We have to get out of it We have to consider 800000 to 900000 government servants There are 17 million public servants who need to be paid monthly We have to spend 84 percent of the tax revenue to pay 17 million government servants Salaries of some public servants are 200 percent higher than it should be Q The prices of some essentials such as eggs have risen There is speculation that rice would be imported There is talk of a rice scam similar to the sugar scam What are your comments regarding that as a former trade minister These issues crop up as a result of lack of national policies We have been an agriculture based economy since the days of kings We were supposed to have a warehouse containing essential food items Today we are a nation that imports This is because we dont do the right thing at the right time We import at a time when the harvests are coming in Where have we been successful It is easy to blame others either politicians or government servants should take the responsibility We see different policies in the same political party We see Lal Kantha saying something and Harini Amarasuriya saying something different It is essential for the country to assume one policy when it comes to economic recovery and development Q I dont see any difference in your ways of thinking and the manner in which some opposition MPs are thinking regarding the economy Your comments I dont see a difference in thinking but the issue is the ability to get things done They love to profess but when given the opportunities they dont know how to perform It is hard to build up a nation with those who profess because they are eternally on a learning curve"

        "body": "Tamil nationalism would take the same perilous journey dragging the country down with it When proPalestinian groups planned protests on Armistice Day last year policymakers in Europe were livid calling rightly so the conduct disgraceful No matter the context in this case the Israeli military campaign on Gaza in response to the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th such protests held on a special day of the collective memory are an affront to the majority insensitive and provocative On Sunday February 4th when Sri Lanka marked its 76th anniversary of independence the newly elected leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ITAK S Sritharan a known LTTE apologist led a mass protest of blackclad protestors in Kilinochchi and clashed with the Police Several protestors mainly students of Jaffna University were arrested but not Mr Sritharan They were later released Developments in the North and the East receive only a cursory glance in the Southern media It had been so in the past until the bombs went off in Jaffna killing 13 soldiers in 1983 leading to Black July It was the same in the East well until a group of homegrown Islamists attacked churches and tourist hotels killing 250 persons and setting off a fresh bout of Islamophobia Early warning signs that were overlooked in the past have come to haunt the country at some point later When that happens news media themselves go overkill trying to catch up with the missed coverage often inflaming tension The conduct of the security agencies is no different A nuanced understanding can spot the early signs of the breeding of extremism and the political will to nip them in the bud even before they proceed to take violent form which inevitably sometime later would have saved the country from so much carnage and three decades of a nihilistic terrorist war One might ask why single out the Kilinochchi protests when there were several dozen others across the country There is a difference Firstly it is the motive Everyday protestors in the South and some even in the North are protesting against the government which is their fundamental right Whereas Mr Sritharan and his Tamil nationalist cohorts are protesting against the state targeting its deconstruction So did Velupillai Prabakaran Theirs is not a matter of fundamental right though like every other extremist campaign they would cloak it as such It is a matter of security concern Security planners and commonsense political leaders who have seen the evolution of terrorism in this country should be able to dissect the difference between the two by now Secondly it is the capabilities Those few dozen protestors who gathered in a busy city junction holding placards are what one would call Facebook protestors social media warriors without a following who seek their validation not from the people of this country but from their benefactors elsewhere Others are JVP cadres and Peratugamies who have done the cap of civil society activists They are ineffectual publicity hunters whose existence is integral to a noisy democracy as ours One might ask why single out the Kilinochchi protests when there were several dozen others across the country Protestors in the South and some even in the North are protesting against the government which is their fundamental right Mr Sritharan and his Tamil nationalist cohorts are protesting against the state So did Velupillai Prabakaran In contrast S Sritharan is mobilizing a group of people who hold a strong rancour against the state who bred suicide terrorists at an industrial scale in the past and who would do the same if a security lacuna would enable that THIS IS NOT A GENERALIZED REFERENCE TO THE TAMIL PEOPLE BUT TO A SPECIFIC SUBGROUP WHO STILL HOLD A STRONG SENSE OF BITTERNESS FOR THE ANNIHILATION OF THEIR PRIDED TERRORISTS It is for the exact typical reason that the Western nations are reluctant to bring their nationals back from the AlHawl camp of foreign IS fighters in Syria In this context Sri Lanka should pay special attention to the radicalizing elements within the remnants of the LTTE within the country Just like Rohana Wijeweera poached willing recruits in the universities and disgruntled youth to wage a socialist revolution in 1971 against the most socialist government ever to come to power in the country S Sritharan is exploiting a security lacuna to mobilize the disgruntled exLTTE members and their family members to rekindle the next phase of a Tamil nationalist struggle This is a dangerous gamble which would have serious consequences The ITAKs new leader is an unabashed LTTE apologist whose first activity after getting elected was to pay homage to the Tamil National Leader who was a megalomaniac terrorist He is married to the sister of LTTE Colonel Theepan Some have suggested that reference to family matters is lowbrow It isnt A cursory glance at the leadership structure of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State would reveal that they thrived in closely knitted familial networks Sritharan has rejected the 13thAmendment to the Constitution as inadequate and wants a federal state Any solution beyond the full implementation of the 13thAmendment would risk the Balkanization of Sri Lanka The federalism that Tamil nationalism advocates is ethnic federalism Anyone who wishes to take account of the full scope of the disastrous consequences of ethnic federalism can take a look at what is unfolding in Ethiopia which is lumbering from one war to another in part because of a constitution which rather than integrating different ethnic groups amplified their differences through ethnic federalism Sritharan would rekindle the worst excesses of Tamil nationalism Time and space are in his favour If the previous track record of the JVPs second insurgency is any guide 15 years after the disastrous ending in Mullivaikkal is long enough for most people to forget the cost of the previous misadventure and bet on a new one The government at the time is amenable to the Tamil concerns and is occupied with fixing the economy Political leadership that coopted Saharan for just 2000 votes would give a pass to Mr Sritharans excesses However there is no gainsaying that Tamil nationalism would enter a dangerous phase if Sritharan manages to capitalize on a permissive political and security environment He says he renounces violence So said SJV Chelvanayakam So did Amerthalingam while covertly nurturing nascent Tamil militancy hoping to use them as cats paw to intimidate the government in Colombo History if not repeats rhymes Anyone who has followed this column might recall I have warned since way back in 2014 that the ongoing Wahabization of some quarters of the country would degenerate into terrorism though the massive scale of the attack was beyond the belief most of us had about the capabilities of local Islamists Anyone who has followed the trajectory of Islamist terrorism in the world would give the same warning One does not need to look beyond the shores to make an educated guess on where the next phase of Tamil nationalism would lead If undeterred I would give five to seven years before bombs go off That would be a horrid thing to say but politics at its core is selfinterested nasty brutish and manipulative The kind of nationalism that S Sritharan is peddling around would take its own life breeding out extremists terrorists and suicide bombers It happened in the past and will in the future unless it is deprived of the permissive environment That is one lesson one can draw from Sri Lankas 76 years of independence Follow RangaJayasuriya on X"

Dissanayake who is also the leader of the JVP is heading a delegation of the NPP to India on a fiveday threecity visit covering New Delhi Ahmedabad and Thiruvananthapuram The National Peoples Power NPP the political alliance led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP undertook a tour of India setting the stage for political development ahead of the presidential elections slated for the last quarter of this year Its leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake held talks with both Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Monday and with Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan on Tuesday further elevating the importance of the visit The NPP Leader Dissanayake led the party delegation which included senior legislator Vijitha Herath NPP Secretary Nihal Abeysinghe and executive committee member Prof Anil Jayantha After the meeting Dr Jaishankar took to X and said Pleased to meet anuradisanayake Leader of NPP and JVP of Sri Lanka this morning A good discussion on our bilateral relationship and the mutual benefits from its further deepening Also spoke about Sri Lankas economic challenges and the path ahead Online media platforms affiliated with the party have interpreted the visit as Indias recognition of Dissanayakes potential to win the presidential elections Indias invitation to the NPP leaders was not an arbitrary gesture The partys prominence has surged due to its popularity among people after the economic crisis and Aragalaya which resulted in former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa relinquishing his powers Since then foreign envoys including both former Indian High Commissioner Gopal Baglay and current High Commissioner Santhos Jha have met with Dissanayake and other leaders of the party US Ambassador Julie Chung also interacted with the NPP leaders at an official level indicating that the party has become a force to be reckoned with since polling only three percent of the votes in the 2019 Presidential Elections Therefore one cannot merely dismiss this visit as part of Indias regular interaction with political parties across the spectrum in the country The invitation has been timed against the backdrop of a recent survey by the Institute for Health Policy a local research institution which shows that Dissanayake is the most preferred candidate to win the presidential elections From Indias perspective it offers an exploratory opportunity to understand the JVP a party that has historically advocated an antiIndian stance During the 19881989 insurrection led by the JVP the party even referred to the Indian Peace Keeping Force IPKF as the Monkey Force and advocated for its expulsion from the country India had not made significant efforts to engage with the JVP in the past because it lacked political strength among the Sri Lankan populace However the political landscape has changed significantly and the JVPs current visibility and popularity merit international recognition The NPP also views the invitation as an opportunity given its political importance and relevance Online media platforms affiliated with the party have interpreted the visit as Indias recognition of Mr Dissanayakes potential to win the next presidential elections though nothing can be ruled out in the everchanging political and social environment Rather than solely for economic reasons India cannot afford to weaken its ties with Sri Lanka its closest maritime neighbour Indias ties with Sri Lanka are crucial from cultural economic geographical historical political and geostrategic perspectives Maintaining healthy ties with India is essential for any party in power in Sri Lanka Indias relevance is particularly prominent today due to its robust economic growth and influence in the international arena The NPP recognises this reality and has embraced the invitation to liaise with Indian leaders Rather than solely for economic reasons India cannot afford to weaken its ties with Sri Lanka its closest maritime neighbour Under Prime Minister Narendra Modis leadership India has shown a proactive approach in the Indian Ocean Region as reflected in the SAGAR Initiative Security and Growth for All in the Region launched in Mauritius in 2015 India vigorously pursues its interests in the region and seeks access to the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka occupies a crucial position in Indias foreign policy particularly in pillars such as Neighbourhood First and Act East Today India has invested in connectivity projects with Sri Lanka due to its strategic location in the Indian Ocean It has provided financial assistance secured energy projects and proposed infrastructure development plans including a land bridge and undersea pipelines for fuel distribution Indias focus on strategic connectivity projects underscores its desire for robust and stable ties with Sri Lanka Containment of China is another major aspect of Indias interests in Sri Lanka India aims to ensure that no government in Sri Lanka leans towards Beijing Better relations with Sri Lanka are even crucial for India especially in the context of strained relations with proChina governments in neighbouring countries like the Maldives Like its current outreach to the NPP the Indian leaders built similar ties with the leaders of the Rajapaksa Government well ahead of the 2019 elections Ajit Dowal used to meet with Gotabaya Rajapaksa regularly months ahead of the 2019 presidential elections at neutral locations such as Singapore Those meetings were not officially declared though For the first time India has invited a prospective presidential candidate openly this time During the 19881989 insurrection the JVP even referred to the Indian Peace Keeping Force IPKF as the Monkey Force Despite its evolving focus on Sri Lanka India maintains its principal stance on the Tamil national question advocating for powersharing based on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution The JVP a fundamental ally of the NPP has been opposed to India from the outset The JVP should clarify its stance and provide insights into its approach towards ongoing connectivity projects with India including the development of the Trincomalee

lose our ventures With apologies to Shakespeare Sri Lanka is in the IT Age equivalent of the ancient Silk Route hence it is up to us to take advantage from the future of technological innovation to attract investment Communication is the basis of the existence of human society When we think of communications most of us go back to the telegraph and the early telephone forgetting that human beings have always been social animals Human civilization would not have evolved to the state it is in today if not for its inborn need to communicate From the very basic to the advanced these forms of communication have evolved to embrace one of the highest points in the technological invention That urge to communicate led humans to develop and adapt technology to communicate with lessening the burden of life in the process The laying of the transatlantic telegraph cable eliminated the transport of shiploads of cash across the Atlantic and instead facilitated the Telegraphic Transfer of money Just like today adapting technology has not always been easy because changing the status quo leads to opposition from authority Sir William Preece then Chief Engineer of the British Post Office famously declared There are conditions in America which necessitate the use of telephones more than here Here we have a superabundance of messengers errand boys and things of that kind The absence of servants has compelled America to adopt communications systems for domestic purposes The telephone to become a device of mass communication was never intended The original phone was a clever replacement for the telegraph Then businesses realized that they could benefit from direct telephone service but the focus of the telephone companies was not on the mass market It took much pressure from the public before they became commercially available for installation in any home Fast forward to today where the smartphone has led to the explosion in telephone ownership to the point where there are more mobile phones than the population With the Internet came email that suddenly gave the masses the new convenience of sending a message to anyone anywhere quickly and easily whenever you wanted to The adoption of email was incredibly swift as if society was waiting for the next best technological innovation in communication The Government must take note of the current situation facing SLT and listen to its inner voice not that of the armchair heroes who sit outside At this point the best for SLT and the country is to defer the divestment and for the government as its major

transactions From the perspective of technological innovation we are living in a digital age It is transforming the way we interact and the way we work Communication sells Sri Lanka is at a pivotal moment to take advantage of its position in the global information communications highway After all Sri Lanka was a country that was brimming with great potential in early period of post independence For instance the idea for the Maruti car had germinated in its founder after he caught sight of the locally manufactured Upali Fiat during a visit to Sri Lanka in the early 1970s Many decades later look at what Indias automobile industry has achieved and where we are in comparison Another good case in point is how we set up the first mobile phone company in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s when there were just a handful of nations in the world that were using mobile phones But today we are fast falling behind in this segment as well Whereas starting in the late 1980s by liberalising our telecom industry Sri Lanka then leapfrogged others in the region NTT of Japan a global leader in telecommunications transformed Sri Lanka Telecom from a state owned institution into a modern telco with global management concepts and investment strategies Celltel heralded the birth of the first mobile telephone network in South Asia Strategic position We are at the IT crossroads between Europe Africa Middle East and East Asia Sri Lankas geographic proximity to major undersea cables that transmit millions of terabytes of data makes it an attractive destination for operations that serve the information requirements of the region Sri Lankas strategic position can attract investments in some of the nextgeneration industries governed by robotics manufacturing and controlled from anywhere in the world Moreover Sri Lanka could be the staging point for automated transhipments of manufactured goods With its increased use across industries it is projected that by 2030 semiconductor integrated information communication technology devices will be running most operations As Sri Lanka is in the middlebetween the emerging economies of East Asia and Europe it takes equal time for a signal to travel to Europe or East Asia from here We can be the most efficient place given our location from which to conduct many operations It is SLT through its early investment in data centres the cloud and fibreoptic cables along with the investment in a consortium of large global operators to build submarine fibreoptic communication cables from Europe to the Far East that made investors come to Sri Lanka Furthermore our industrial expansion strategy must include preparation to capture the shift from todays factory to the future factory The factory that will run remotely with Internet of Things IoT enabled machines communicating via 56G technology supported by fibreoptic backbone Likewise organizations will be at an advantage given the flexibility to use data centres and cloud services managed centrally The future organization which will also reflect this transformation will not require inhouse computers and IT specialists to process information An organization will not require any software on its premises and thereby require human resources only to carry out its core business Such technology will even operate autonomous cars feeding on different signals such as traffic lights and other commands to navigate itself In the future rather than labour becoming the deciding factor for efficiency a company setting up business will find the location the most decisive factor Ideally businesses will become more transparent and less manipulative in such a setup as small players will have equal access and chances as the more prominent players Consumers will choose based on what is good for the community and the planet Capitalisms monopolistic nature will reduce when automation gives every industry and business irrespective of scale the opportunity to be efficient Competition will be on the quality of the product rather than the volume of scale Given Sri Lankas strategic location for transhipment smart autonomous port operations can transform our status as an efficient service provider It is SLT through its early investment in data centres the cloud and fibreoptic cables along with the investment in a consortium of large global operators to build submarine fibreoptic communication cables from Europe to the Far East that made investors come to Sri Lanka SLT has built the foundation of the infrastructure of the future Government must be cognizant of the reality of the countrys excellent position in the global communications technology highway to harness it Intelligent people worldwide know that the change will overtake the world in the next decade and if Sri Lanka is to fall in line to ride this tide then our systems need to be swiftly put to embrace the opportunity therein As longterm investors envisage this future scenario many prudent telcos are making investments in these changes The big question is are we ready to create the environment for investors to consider Sri Lanka as one of the best places to do business Because of its foresight into the future globally Israel is known as the startup nation Sri Lankas location is an opportunity for it to be another startup nation The steam engine gave birth to the industrial revolution It was considered a miracle for that era as it reduced the toil on manual labour and increased energy efficiency The steam engine derived efficiency from its production scale making it cheaper and easier to produce in large amounts The larger the establishment the higher the productivity which meant that people had to migrate to the cities to fill in the jobs required to meet the demand for increased output On the strength of the steam engine they built large industrial cities Mass migration occurred hence people lived in poverty exploited and worked long hours under deplorable working conditions and low wages These abysmal working conditions led to many chronic health conditions and workers having a low quality of life There was scant regard for environmental pollution The darker side of capitalism operated as the industrial revolution accelerated Murky capitalist order However today we can expect a change in this hitherto murky capitalist order Such as with fibreoptics 56G technology Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and robotics will lead to automated manufacturing moving to decentralized and remote manufacturing where labour will no longer be a factor A small factory will be as efficient as a large one Big cities will slowly disappear Mass of people congregating in one place will not happen as technology will connect them from wherever they are The Pandemic was a good example demonstrating the possibility of working remotely It has been a learning curve for SLT with its 8000 employees not required in the office as before Renewable sources of energy is the future choice The distributed nature of renewable energy sources requires a Smart Grid to transmit electricity anywhere in any direction replacing the environmentally polluting gigantic coal power plants The technology SLT will provide will play a pivotal role to create the smart grid that can switch electricity from one place to another fast Operations will become decentralized with investment in renewable energy semiconductors robotics and fibreoptics that support infrastructure for nextgeneration networks and connectivity resulting in less travel Less travel will lead to less pollution That in turn would lead to an improvement in the quality of life The planet will be able to regenerate and sustain itself when there are environmentally friendly practices the overuse and depletion of resources will reduce In the next ten years the health sector will be one of the most critical areas that will benefit from these advancements Likewise the agriculture industry can be mechanized and automated to use precision techniques including in pest control That would negate the need for harmful pesticides The value to society of present and coming advances in communications technology and infrastructure is immense Twenty years ago no one expected this many advancements to take place in technology However SLT started investing in the technology the country required Internally to make this happen we need to continually reinvest That requires nondebt sources of capital given the present country economic situation This is why SLT needs a world class strategic investment partner Today more than ever we have to make hard and fast decisions We can learn from other countries Singapore for example developed not because it had better people than Sri Lanka Singapore developed because it had leaders and ministers who put the country and its people before them and built the system to create an enabling environment People in Singapore dont break the law because the law is applied equally to all As a nation we must understand the brutal fact that we have to make decisions with the countrys interest foremost It is up to individual countries to choose and ride the tide at the end of the day Countries that have begun to embrace this change will achieve ultralow latency communications by 2030 And it will be a different world for such countries while those that fail to adopt these changes will be impaired While for Sri Lanka it is still within reach Decisionmakers must understand that this change is a life and death matter given we have hit rock bottom Telecommunications as a reinvestmentintensive industry The technology of today will be different tomorrow So we have to invest more than we invest today tomorrow as well SLTs mission has to considered as national In years 2021 and 2022 SLT results showed that no other utility industry in the country generated a profit ran efficiently to create a profit than SLT Yet if you take the years since the unfortunate and almost forced exit of NTT from SLT reinvestment needed into SLT becoming the bedrock of driving IT led growth has slowed down drastically SLT never had a proper globally recognised JV partner since the exit of NTT With the planned divestment of the government owned shares in SLT there was initial hope that a multiplicity of globally recognised telco with ability to reinvest will vie with each other But unfortunately the government is left with only three interested parties In the meantime in the face of uncertainty SLTs performance is fast sliding down SLT is the bedrock on which the entire digital infrastructure of the nation rests And this staggering infrastructure has been built brick by brick over the last one hundred and sixty years with investment raised locally with publics money by literally generations of people including engineers and other professionals of our country If not for SLT not even its fiercest competitor telcos would operate because they all by and large depend on SLTs foundation infrastructure at the end of the day The Government must take note of the current situation facing SLT and listen to its inner voice not that of the armchair heroes who sit outside At this point the best for SLT and the country is to defer the divestment and for the government as its major shareholder stabilise SLT Once SLT and the country is out of the woods a globally recognised diversity of telco will show interest instead of the present limited interest And at that time carry out the divestment in a manner that foremost safeguards national interest About the

        "body": "The SalamaFikira FP Group a leading global security and risk management firm warned in January that despite a perceived decline in Somali piracy recent incidents indicate that the menace has not been eradicated and remains a formidable challenge By January 2011 736 people were taken as hostages and 32 ships were captured by pirates Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses costing an estimated US 69 billion a year in global trade according to Oceans Beyond Piracy OBP According to the German Institute for Economic Research DIW a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy Insurance companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as these companies hiked premium rates in response The hijacking of a bulk carrier off the coast of Somalia on the 14th of December 2023 was the first since 2017 said Lt Col Conrad Thorpe Chairman of the SalamaFikira While unusual it was not surprising given the Somali piracy capability has never been relinquished he added Thorpe warned that the tactics employed including the use of a mother ship a large ship which can go long distances enable pirates to operate at sea for extended periods and at considerable distances catching ship owners off guard The Somali pirates once a significant concern between 2008 and 2016 saw a decline in activity due to concerted international efforts But since the IsraelHamas war in Gaza began in October 2023 the worlds attention was diverted leaving the coast off the Horn of Africa unpoliced The FP Group warned that pirates are expanding their reach into the Arabian Sea and northern Indian Ocean targeting ships away from the perceived Houthi threat area in the Red Sea Piracy incidents off the coast of Somalia rose dramatically after 2005 and reached a high of 243 in 2011 but then plunged in 2012 to 63 attacks says a World Bank report Since the first known Somali hijacking in April 2005 till about 2013 149 ships were ransomed for an estimated total of US 315 US 385 million the report says The international community has now mobilized to combat the surge of piracy off the Horn of Africa Over 40 countries are involved in military counterpiracy operations Since 2008 the United Nations UN Security Council has adopted 13 resolutions to support counterpiracy action off the Horn of Africa Landbased Crime But a Sri Lankan researcher Amali Kartika Karawita of the London School of Public Relations in Jakarta says in her paper entitled Piracy in Somalia An Analysis of the Challenges Faced by the International Community that piracy is actually a landbased crime and not a seabased crime People take to piracy because of economic problems and unsettled conditions in their countries on land that is Somalia is a failed state pushing its young men into crime including piracy Since millions of dollars can be made through piracy it is now in the hands of the rich with links with money launders in Dubai Therefore the solution to piracy lies not so much in capturing and prosecuting the pirates at sea but in setting right the horrendous conditions in Somalia Karawita argues Piracy has become a lucrative business in Somalia due to the political instability caused by the absence of an effective government There are fights between different factions striving for power she points out War lords rule the roost Agriculture and industry if any have collapsed due to the internal wars and absence of governance This has created unemployment and abject poverty Civil War From 1969 to 1991 Mohamed Said Barre ruled the country with an iron fist but his overthrow transformed Somalia into a theatre of violent fights between clans for power At the dawn of the present century radical Islam entered the fray War with neighbouring countries only made matters worse The international community failed to rebuild and stabilize the country Foreign aid was eaten up by the influential few There was no strong central authority to ensure that such things did not happen People began to indulge in crime including piracy to make ends meet first and then to become rich Grinding Poverty Poverty in Somalia is endemic Over 12 million people were living below the international poverty line of US 019 per day in 2017 The unemployment rate was 67 for a population in which 70 were under the age of 30 When taking into consideration that a single pirate hijack can lead to a ransom range between US 500 000 to US 3 million with individual profit going up to US 15000 in a country where poverty is rampant and economic opportunities are low it becomes understandable why piracy is an attractive business for young Somalis Karawita says The US with the support of the UN launched a multinational operation in December 1992 called United Nations Operation in Somalia UNOSOM to curb piracy But UNOSOM only reinforced the warlords power and allowed the proliferation of armed groups The UNOSOM was eventually withdrawn Karawita recalls The failure of the international community to find a durable solution to the Somali politicoeconomic problem provided a fertile ground for the emergence of radical Islamist movements seeking to create an Islamic State Since 1991 local terrorist organizations such as AlItihaad have tried to establish an Islamic State AlQaeda also developed a network here Somalias 3330 km coastline and its land borders were not patrolled The absence of an effective authority over Somali territorial waters led to foreign fishing vessels plundering Somalis fish stocks costing the country US 300 million a year in losses This affected supply in Somalia Somali waters had also become the dumping ground of hazardous waste for industrialized countries since the early 1980s This destroyed fish stocks Shipping companies found dumping in these unpoliced seas much cheaper than disposing off their waste by scientific methods US 250 per ton against US 250 per ton To combat such dumping Somali fishermen began attacking foreign ships and seeking ransom to let them off Fishermen joined hands with militias and unemployed youth to hijack ships Those who took to piracy on a big scale lived lavishly But the traditional Somali practice of sharing wealth with the community led to many common folk developing a stake in piracy albeit indirectly The piracyled economy was also built on corruption People openly bribed their way through officialdom Somalia was ranked as one of the worlds most corrupt countries in 2011 obtaining a score of 1 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being the least corrupt Corruption is intrinsically linked to money laundering Organized pirates syndicates operating in Dubai have been laundering money acquired through ransoms These syndicates play a major role in the development of piracy off the coast of Somalia especially in providing access to new technologies useful for hijacking and tracking ships Since 2008 the international antipiracy operation Atalanta was highly successful Several states like China Russia India and South Korea have been sending navy ships in the region The Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia CGPCS serves as a liaison between different naval forces involved in counterpiracy operations within the Gulf of Aden an Internationally Recognized Transit Corridor and a part of the Somali basin Then there is the Djibouti Code of Conduct to share intelligence But this is a nonbinding agreementTherefore the level of political support is quite weak Karawita says Much depends on whether states have sufficient national legislations and willingness to commit forces for antipiracy work and bring pirates to trial Both are expensive The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS Article 101 defines piracy as any illegal acts of violence or detention or any act of depredation committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft on the high seas against another ship or aircraft This means that when piracy is committed within territorial waters of a country it cannot be classified as piracy This is a handicap And if the state concerned is weak or is a failed state like Somalia piracy will not be investigated at all"

by placing national interest in the forefront We must engage with a country based on an agenda that best suits us Whether its India China or America no other country is going to come and work with us or engage with us without an agenda National Peoples Power or NPP the major alliance of JanathaVimukthi Peramuna JVP is in a historical juncture of its political journey as its leaders have visited India on an invitation by the Indian Government In the 1980s the JVP took a strong stance on India especially against the IndoLanka pact signed under the J R Jayewardene government Taking a more flexible line on geopolitics compared to several decades ago the NPP is ready to deal with any foreign power by placing national interest in the forefront Talking about transformation from once a revolutionary movement Dr HariniAmarasuriya academic who was elected to Parliament on NPPs national list criticised how tax policies have been implemented by the government and went on to share how the party is going to deal with IMFs loan restructuring process Excerpts of the interview Q You are a member of the NPP and are you a you member of the JVP as well No I am not a member of the JVP Q How does this statement make a difference JVP is a political party which is part of the National Peoples Power NPP which is a broader coalition that consists of about 28 other organizations of which the JVP is the leading political party But there are other organisations which are also part of the NPP and I am a member of the Progressive Womens Collective PWC which was started in 2019 and the National Intellectual Organization NIO which was started in 2017 or 2018 QWho made the decision for you to be an MP Was it made by the JVP or NPP Well it was a decision that was taken collectively by NPP when we met soon after the election and there was a discussion about what we should do in the aftermath and also about who we should send as our national list MP To be honest the JVP is represented in our national steering committee and each of our organizations has two representatives in the NPPs Steering Committee and the proposal that it should be made came from the JVP representatives in the steering committee And the rest of the committee agreed Q Is this understanding between the JVP and NPP continuing from strength to strength or where does it stand now We made the decision in 2019 itself when the NPP was formed that future elections will be contested by the NPP Since 2019 and 2020 we have been there as the NPP So at the Presidential Elections Anura Kumara Dissanayake will be contesting as the NPP Presidential candidate and at the General Election we will be contesting as the NPP Already we have worked together over the last few years and this is one of the biggest achievements During the last couple of years we have been drawing in new people into the movement Some of them are coming through the JVP and some of them are coming through NIO and some of them are coming through DWC and the other womens organizations There are other organizations like Aluth Piyapath the youth groups and trade unions that are involved with us QCertain critics of NPPJVP allege that the decision making process is not clear and takes place secretively What are your comments There is nothing underground or clandestine how we do things In fact neither is the JVP an underground or a clandestine movement The leadership is very evident Everybody knows who the leader is and the leadership of the NPP is very public This perception that you are talking about is a perception that is created and how our opponents try to challenge us In a political arena our critics also have to come ups with something So this is kind of going back to history and labelling it as a secretive Left organization and a guerrilla type movement Attempts are made to delve into the past to try and indicate that this is what is happening now as well Even if you take only the JVP forget the NPP the JVP has been in parliament and part of the democratic system since 1990s We are a registered political party so is the JVP And JVP and the NPP are a few of the political parties that actually conduct proper audits and submit them to the Election Commission You can check on that So we have been very transparent in our dealings Of course we have a decision making structure Our decision making structure unlike the traditional parties is not the leader who makes our decisions for us Ranil Wickremesinghe can decide what he wants to do with the UNP But Anura Kumara Dissanayake doesnt decide on what to do with the NPP or with the JVP We have a leadership council We have a steering committee at the NPP and the decisions are made through discussion debate and dialogue And once a decision is made we all stick to it We are actually a democratic party where the leader doesnt have the sole authority to decide on things for us Clandestine decision making in a secret organization is really an old way of thinking and one that the JVP discarded several decades ago QAs a solution to the ongoing economic crisis the government has come up with the plan to go with the IMF and none other than the Central Bank Governor says there is no other alternative even if there is a change in government Even some opposition politicians are also of the opinion that this is the way forward What is the stance of the NPP First of all this idea that there is no alternative is something that needs to be examined carefully because there is always alternatives There are always alternatives for everything and it is very dangerous limiting way of thinking if we start off by saying that there is no alternative In that case the human history will never change or will never evolve That is an extremely narrow way of thinking What we are talking about relates to a specific situation context and crisis right now We would have dealt with this crisis in a different way perhaps Had we been in power we might not have had to declare a state of bankruptcy That would not have been the path we would have taken But that path has already been taken It is beyond our control now That is the path that the previous government had taken Now we have to sort it out from there Once a country declares a state of bankruptcy you have to restructure loans The restructuring process has already emerged A new government cannot suddenly decide on going back to the drawing board on that However we dont necessarily agree with all the conditions or all the decisions that are being made by this government under the guise of an IMF agreement The IMF will tell you to balance the account How you balance your account is up to your government The IMF will say get your tax system in order How you do that is up to each government The IMF is not going say or specify that you should raise your taxes upto 18 percent or 25 percent or whether it is that VAT that needs to be increased or some other tax The IMF will say come up with a rational tax policy What we disagree on is the manner in which this government is using the IMF agreement or the IMF restructuring agreement to make decision about the economy Because those decisions have been proven to have failed We are not doing anything different now that we havent already done Privatisation didnt start today it started in the 1990s This tax system has been around for years Selling what we consider as our important national assets is not a new thing either So it is these policies that were badly managed which led to this crisis So nothing has changed QSo what needs to be changed primarily Primarily what needs to be changed is the political culture in this country or the politics of this country where all decision making is actually based not on policy but on corruptions and deals So the government tax policies are based on deals They are not based on the most rational tax policy for a country such as ours but what is the tax policy that will benefit your friend At the end of the day that is what happens in this country You decide on a development project not based on science or evidence on discussions with the public but from where you get the best commissions That is what needs to be changed first This government keeps talking about successive governments that had ruled this country and about the importance of the private sector What have they done to support the private sector What have they done to enable the private sector to function in a way that doesnt mean that a private sector has to make friends and deals with politicians in order to get things done It is extremely difficult for the majority who are really ethical and honest private sector people who have integrity to function in this country The only people who thrive or most of the people who thrive do so because they have connections with the politicians We want to change that There needs to be policies in place Thats the role of the government QDo you mean that the tax policies are based on deals and vested interests Thats what I said I mean I take an example How was that tax on sugar imposed We are a country with certain tax exemptions How come OK you need to have room for a government to have tax exemptions But the way tax exemptions are being granted in this country have benefited those having political connections QBut when the Restructuring Process was introduced there were conditions laid by the IMF itself to follow anticorruption policies and introduce a transparent system Doesnt the government know about it or is that the IMF ignores them The IMF is not intervening in political decision making In the Governance Diagnostic Report too they have stated how corruption is one of the major reasons for the political crisis So they have recommended that you bring in laws to prevent corruption We all supported the AntiCorruption Bill Has it being implemented Has the necessary institutional infrastructure required to implement the Act being set up No So to this idea that to sort economic issues laws can be removed from politics and that will effect change is really a misguided idea You need a political will QSo provided an NPP lead government assumes power at the next elections would you continue with the IMF or not If we are elected we will be elected on the mandate on which we campaign In that campaign what we will say is that we will free ourselves from this crisis We will present a plan as to how we are going to resolve this crisis And we dont think the IMF will be opposed to that plan We dont see any reason why the IMF will be unable to work with us QResults of certain surveys have been released and NPP is even more popular than the Samagi Janabalawegaya SJB the main opposition party But when the election results are released we dont see this popularity being reflected in the final count Can people expect something different at the elections this year I think what you saw in the past was that the JVP wasnt popular like the way we are at present The citizens of the country are more aware have a conscience and are mobilised The second factor that is being ignored is that we as the NPP have worked really hard at the grassroots level to educate the citizens of this country to provide that political mobilization and political education and what citizenship really is about We have also educated them about the need and the role of a citizen in doing this in a very critical moment We are talking about a different time and different period where a lot of things have changed QDo you have any estimation as to what percentage of the vote base the NPP can account for Thats a tricky question We want to be able to form a government with the majority and be able to bring about changes So we are working towards winning that majority And we want to be able to establish a government that will enable us to bring about the transformation this country so desperately needs QOver the passage of time the JVP has been branded as an antiwest or an antiAmerican political movement Certain past leaders of the party strongly used this slogan during the partys campaigns Does the NPP has similar views We are not anti anything We are only anti people who have destroyed this country through their corruption and through their extremely petty personal agendas We have been having meetings with the diplomatic community on a regular basis over the past few months and years We have very cordial relationships with all the diplomatic missions in this country QIf we talk about the geopolitical situation right now Sri Lanka is being hounded up by super powers like China India Japan and the United States What is the relationship NPP is going to have with these super powers specially China and India We will engage with every country based on a foreign policy that we feel is most suitable for us So we will have a foreign policy that we will be developed based on what will be to our best interest The ideal position for us to take is one where we are not aligned too much with any one country but one which allows us to be open with every country We must engage with a country based on an agenda that best suits us Whether its India China or America no other country is going to come and work with us or engage with us without an agenda The problem is that we dont have an agenda And then we have to go with their agenda because we dont have one When we sit at a discussion table we are in a weak position We dont know what we want We cant really engage with them in a straightforward manner because at any moment the minister might ask for a bribe They know that we are already on the backfoot We must make the changes thatll enable us to engage in business matters with mutual respect And when we sit down having an agenda we can look at areas of common interest and work with common cooperation and collaboration and trust QTraditionally the JVP with its Marxist ideology has had a soft corner for China hasnt it This relationship had not been denied by the party leadership as well Obviously China is a socialist country and JVP is a socialist party so there is a engagement that exists between them I mean Communism and socialism are international movements Its not that something happens in isolation Of course there are areas where political ideologies are more sort in sync with others But it is a different situation when you engage with a political party and when you engage with the government in power When the Chinese government engages with the Government of Sri Lanka it doesnt happen on a communist agenda Then how on earth is it working with Ranil Wickremesinghe who is the most right wing of all presidents and also with Mahinda Rajapaksa So this is not how foreign policy works"

        "body": "For close to a decade and a half I have been studying cooperatives particularly as I was preoccupied with questions about the postwar reconstruction of Jaffna As I watched the failure of development policies that prioritised building transport and urban infrastructure over rural livelihoods supported the proliferation of financial institutions leading to indebtedness and grand claims about the private sector generating employment that did not materialize I became more and more involved with the cooperative movement Drawing on the institutional memory of the cooperative movement and the vast network of cooperatives that survived the war some of us began to see an alternative for social and economic revival of the still rural wartorn society in the North Those initiatives that began as an alternative for postwar recovery have gained more traction with the ongoing economic crisis As agricultural production and the food system have become crucial for survival amidst a food crisis and the cost of living along with transport and energy costs multiply people are increasingly turning to the local economy linked to cooperatives A younger generation of youth including young women are entering the cooperatives as employees and members and in some places becoming energetic leaders of the movement The governments and the elites bluff about economic recovery is now exposed with the mounting hardships of the working class The challenge for the working people today is to throw out this government and ensure that another government with the same bankrupt vision is not elected The cooperative alternative for wartorn rural livelihoods in Northern Sri Lanka is now slowly providing some options to address the economic crisis that is devastating the country as a whole For those of us who are part of the cooperative movement in the North the renewed interest in cooperation from womens groups peoples movements and intellectuals from the East the Hill Country and the South more broadly is pushing us to think critically about our own work including our strengths and weaknesses Is cooperation towards achieving selfsufficiency in the context of a global debt crisis that is not only crippling Sri Lanka but much of the Global South after decades of neocolonial financial dependency on the West an alternative for survival and recovery And how much of that cooperative alternative depends on the particular historical development of each region and country From 1948 As we mark another anniversary of Sri Lanka gaining independence from colonial rule on 4th February 1948 I record below from a report that year The Reserve Bank of India RBI undertook a study about the cooperative movement in Ceylon in 1948 to gain insights for cooperatives in India Reviewing the tremendous increase in cooperatives in the 1940s the RBI claimed every village in Ceylon had a cooperative and that it was now a live issue where cooperatives whose membership comprised just 7 percent of the population in 1942 had risen to twothirds of the population by 1947 The question of course is what role the state played in such an expansion And what cost would the state have to incur for such an expansion particularly if we are to draw any lessons for our Government today which is under the fiscal straight jacket of an IMF program On the question of state support for cooperatives during the stringent financial situation of the Second World War the RBI report has the following to say Our country has been placed at the mercy of the IMF World Bank and Asian Development Bank backed by the West powerful creditors including China Japan and India and the extractive global financiers to whom we have sold our sovereignty in the form of International Sovereign Bonds At the outset it may be mentioned that from the point of view of the financial stake the government does not seem to have committed themselves more than what the government in any other country particularly in India has done The movement has been selfsupporting to a very large extent and the finance amounting to millions of rupees has all been found from within The importance of stateaid is therefore to be seen more on the moral side than on the material pages 6667 Cooperation in Ceylon Reserve Bank of India 1948 I draw on this history recorded during the year of Sri Lankas Independence for three reasons Firstly it is important for us to think again about what independence means as our country has been placed at the mercy of the IMF World Bank and Asian Development Bank backed by the West powerful creditors including China Japan and India and the extractive global financiers to whom we have sold our sovereignty in the form of International Sovereign Bonds Secondly our history tells us that cooperation is more about a vision than funds from an external actor and for that matter the state although the redistribution of resources including land and are crucial for economic progress Thirdly that we advanced cooperation towards selfsufficiency during a similar crisis in the past and in a relatively short period of time Vision Today The problem today is not just that the government will not provide material support towards cooperation Rather the governments colonised ideological vision works actively against any form of cooperation and selfsufficiency Instead of rejecting decades of dependency on crisis inducing extractive financiers and for that matter the fickle tourism sector government policies are only reinforcing such dependency under the watchful eye and stringent conditions of the IMF such as trade liberalisation The challenge for the working people today is to throw out this government and ensure that another government with the same bankrupt vision is not elected Cooperation is ultimately about the mobilisation of people The governments and the elites bluff about economic recovery is now exposed with the mounting hardships of the working class In the agitation of the fisher folk the farmers the factory workers and the youth there are possibilities of forging a vision for cooperation in our crisisridden times Such a vision cannot merely go back to the strategies of the 1940s rather we need to research and rethink how production markets technology credit services and the institutional forms of cooperative societies and federations have to be developed for the realities of the 21st century From addressing the microfinance debt crisis to the challenges of reviving rural livelihoods there are many lessons from cooperative ventures in the North that could be scaled up towards a national vision of selfsufficiency and development"

consuming considerable aviation fuel and time Pix by Kushan Pathiraja The 76th February 4th has passed marked by four days of aerobatics consuming considerable aviation fuel and time This prompts questions about resource usage during such events The primary question persists why after 76 years of independence hasnt this celebration translated into genuine freedom To attain complete freedom for Sri Lankans there is a need to fully implement the 13th Amendment or consider extending beyond its provisions Despite the festivities onethird of our child population is starving revealing a stark contrast between proclaimed freedom and harsh realities The disconnect raises questions about national priorities and the need to reevaluate policies to ensure tangible improvements for all citizens Politicians often extol the virtues of democracy presenting it as a catalyst for progress yet paradoxically nations with restricted political freedom seem to outpace them in certain aspects The conventional world order a result of Peace of Westphalia signed in 1648 marked the end of the thirty and eighty years wars establishing the foundation for modern international relations The 30 Years War 16181648 was a conflict between feuding Catholic and Protestant estates within the Holy Roman Empire Simultaneously the 80year war 15681648 was fought over the Netherlands quest for independence from Spain Despite the festivities onethird of our child population is starving revealing a stark contrast between proclaimed freedom and harsh realities The disconnect raises questions about national priorities and the need to reevaluate policies to ensure tangible improvements for all citizens This historic treaty introduced key principles such as state sovereignty diplomatic mediation and the basis for religious toleration from a political standpoint It laid the groundwork for international laws and influenced the formation of entities like the European Union and the United Nations The Westphalian system retains its influence on global politics with current international treaties and conventions Meanwhile emerging powers in the Eurasian region like Russia China India Indonesia and Vietnam are undergoing significant development challenging the traditional dominance of Western nations In contrast as a nation gaining independence in 1948 precisely 300 years after the Westphalian Peace and initially boasting healthy foreign reserves we unfortunately witnessed economic decay over the past 76 years This decline reached its peak with a bankrupt Treasury leading to the emergence of a politically rejected individual stepping in to take charge and rescue the nation In certain parts of the world the freedom of selfexpression speech and thought thrives while in others it remains elusive Individuals conditioned by their backgrounds often rebel expressing their discontent through various sometimes immature reactions termed as freedom This rebellion manifests in different ways When people get fed up with politics they sometimes just step back and avoid it Some folks when facing economic issues try creating small groups with their own rules to be more independent but these groups often break apart over time In terms of religion some people rebel against established beliefs by joining different religious groups following leaders or rejecting organized religion altogether Are these actions just outward attempts to find freedom These different responses show how personal expression and societal rules interact in the pursuit of freedom Freedom is super important in life People all over the world have fought for it in politics Religions often say they offer freedom but usually they mean it in the afterlife In countries with capitalism theres some personal freedom but historically communist nations have not been big on it Amidst global chaos recognizing the vital need for human unity beyond divisions like nationality and religion is crucial for survival Relying on politics or legislation alone wont bring about this essential transformation Throughout history people have fought for freedom not only in politics but also in the realm of religion The Inquisition serves as a stark example using excommunication torture and banishment to suppress the pursuit of freedom Wars too have been waged over freedom forming a recurring pattern in our shared history Trying to be free from something often means carrying on with modified versions of our past not really breaking free True freedom isnt about having a specific direction or making choices When theres a clear direction it brings division choices and conflicts True freedom is found when the mind and heart are free from these limitations existing without being divided or conflicted Theres no special type of freedom called individual freedom its just freedom When we say individual it means something that cant be split not something against the group But weve made up this idea of individuality with its own traits which come from how weve been taught and influenced We often compare this individuality with being part of a group Our culture money stuff and how we live all play a role in shaping how our minds work True freedom is beyond these influences outside of our usual way of thinking The responsibility that comes with being free from these influences is different from what we usually think of as freedom Freedom lies in being bold Robert Frost Amidst global chaos recognizing the vital need for human unity beyond divisions like nationality and religion is crucial for survival Relying on politics or legislation alone wont bring about this essential transformation In a world filled with conflicts and violence driven by profit and ideologies individuals must question their role and the

        "body": "Although Jaffna district Member of Parliament Sivagnanam Sritharan had told the media on what principles he would lead the struggle for the political rights of the Tamil people after being elected as the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ITAK popularly known as the Federal Party it was expected that he would officially explain his policies after assuming office at the partys convention that was to be held in Trincomalee last Sunday However the convention was postponed indefinitely due to controversies surrounding selections for other posts including the post of the General Secretary of the party So the new leader was unable to deliver that important speech After the election of Sritharan by the partys General Council in a secret ballot at Trincomalee Town Hall on 21 January the other contender Member of Parliament MA Sumanthiran had publicly announced that he would cooperate with the new leader However the incidents that took place in Trincomalee last Saturday and the subsequent comments made by the stalwarts of the ITAK clearly indicate the challenges that Sritharan will have to face in leading the party as a cohesive entity While it is not known for sure when the convention will be convened criticisms are being made on the basis of the comments made by Sritharan to the media After the end of the civil war Sritharan who has been a long time resident of Wanni the heartland of the ethnic war contested as a candidate of the Tamil National Alliance TNA from the Jaffna district at the Parliamentary Election in 2010 and entered Parliamentary politics He was an ardent supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE He never hesitated to say it publicly He has been a Member of Parliament for the last 14 years and has often expressed his views in support of the LTTE inside and outside Parliament Sritharans comments even after he was elected as the leader of the ITAK showed that he was intent on leading the party on a political path that followed the LTTEs principles but not an armed struggle Based on the interview given by Sritharan to the Tamil Guardian newspaper it seems that he is sure that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution is not going to be the solution to the problems of the Tamil people He has said that any political solution found within the scope of a unitary state will not satisfy the political aspirations of the Tamil people and that their journey is towards a solution based on a federal system He told the Tamil Guardian that the Tamils goal is to find a solution in a merged NorthEastern Province that can recognize the land language and cultural identities of the Tamils and to help the Tamils in the homeland in charting a political path for the liberation of the Eelam Tamils About 15 years have passed since the end of the civil war Sritharan must realize the inadequacies of a political approach that binds the Tamil people to memories of past struggles He said that it is very important to unite the Tamils in the homeland and the diaspora Tamil community and connect with the Tamils in Tamil Nadu in charting a political path Calling for the unity of the Tamil parties he said that the diaspora Tamil community has an important role in uniting the Tamil nationalist forces and charting a path for all Above all it is important to note that Sritharan has said that their journey should begin from the graves of the Eelam national liberation fighters There is no doubt that his views are aimed at appeasing his supporters including radical groups within the Tamil diaspora But what took place is only an internal party election No one knows what the Tamil people think about Sritharans stance About 15 years have passed since the end of the civil war and in todays domestic and international political situation Sritharan who has come to the leadership of the main political party of Sri Lankan Tamils has the responsibility to understand the challenges that may lie ahead of him He must realize the inadequacies of a political approach that binds the Tamil people to memories of past struggles He should be freed from thinking that a political thought which remembers and emphasizes past struggles and sacrifices is the Tamil peoples view It is his view Such views may be a liability in the present context The irrelevance and dangers of applying to parliamentary politics the political doctrines of a movement which believed only in armed struggle must be grasped for the entire Tamil community And it is not an easy task to remobilize the Tamil people of the North and East today as the leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front TULF of those days did using emotional slogans in the preVaddukkoddai Resolution period The needs of the Tamil people and their thinking about the future have completely changed Most of them are dreaming of migrating to Western Europe or North America The more nationalist forces among the Southern Sri Lankan polity will definitely take advantage of Sritharans rise as the leader of the main political party of the Tamils and whip up communal propaganda that the separatist forces are reemerging in the North and East There are already clear signs of that Fifteen years after the end of the civil war the election of someone with a staunch Tamil nationalist stance like Sritharan as leader of the ITAK is a setback for the relatively moderate forces within the party in particular and Tamil polity in general However the governments that came to power after the end of the war are themselves responsible for this unfortunate scenario Tamil political leaders who believe in solving the ethnic problem by negotiating with the government through constitutional processes should have been able to show some results to the Tamil people to justify their actions The usual deceitful approach and actions of governments are the main reason for the isolation of moderate political forces from amongst the Tamils and the regaining of influence by radical nationalist forces It is against this backdrop that Sritharans victory and Sumanthirans defeat should be viewed in the election of the leader of the ITAK"

parts of the country shared kiribath and lit crackers over the killing of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran by the army on May 19 2009 How did you feel when the news about the tragic death of State Minister Sanath Nishantha first reached you Did it make you feel sorrow or happy Indeed we all might have felt either one of the two though sometimes we might have regretted rejoicing over the tragedy later There is a debate now going on in social media over celebrating deaths after the same social media circulated a lot of cheery posts on the death of Sanath Nishantha The general perception is that rejoicing at deaths is bad and a state of degeneration of ones civility But how many of us can avoid taking pleasure over a death of a person whom we hate is a valid question though the majority of us tend to hide our elation or the satisfaction over the death of such a person Sanath Nishantha had been a controversial politician in the Gampaha District who had earned wrath and hate from his opponents by his statements and actions He made headlines by conducting an illegal motorcycle parade without number plates and helmets during the 2020 general election campaign and again by an argument with a female forest officer in the same year over his insistence to clear a part of a mangrove forest to make way for a playground He was arrested by the CID in connection with the attack on the peaceful protesters on May 9 2022 in front of the Temple Trees and the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo Fort two sites of protests which had been named by the protesters as MainaGoGama and GotaGoGama During a YouTube interview he had said he would have killed even a hundred people had the protesters or their supporters laid a finger on him or his leader Mahinda Rajapaksa on that day However many of those who hated him over such incidents are not saints either The only difference is that they are not on the ruling side now For an instance one would recall an incident taken place not long back but on July 26 2017 where a group of thugs who claimed to be the residents of Kolonnawa launched a massive attack on striking workers of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation near the Kolonnawa oil installation Sanath Nishantha was on the wrong side at a wrong time when he died in an accident along the Katunayake Expressway on early January 25 He was an ardent supporter of the Rajapaksa family and dared to vividly showcase it at a time when the public anger against his party the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP and the Rajapaksas is overwhelming due to the agonizing effects of the current economic crisis In spite of the leaders of the SLPP and President Ranil Wickremesinghe claiming that they have rescued the country from an economic catastrophe citing the absence of public agitations and long queues for fuel and cooking gas the level of suffering by the people has multiplied now compared to what was experienced by them in 2022 amidst queues and demonstrations The frustration and anger among the masses is being well manifested by the galloping upsurge in the public support for the JVPNPP these days Hence the negative posts in social media about Sanath Nishanthas death have to be taken as those not only targeted at him but also at the political camp he represented It was also a manifestation of the frustration whether it is civilized or uncivilized If a similar fate befell now on those who were behind the attack on the petroleum workers in 2017 we sometimes wouldnt read jubilant posts in social media as they are not on the wrong side at the moment Celebrating deaths is not a new phenomenon in Sri Lanka and in other countries We can witness or at least feel this wherever there are rivalries conflicts and hatred not only in the field of politics but in other fields as well especially where money and other resources are involved Intolerance of dissent and disagreement even in democratic politics and religious matters also leads to prayers for death and attempts on lives of others For instance many people openly prayed for the deaths of certain Ministers of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government who had fallen victim to the Corona virus in 2020 The Easter Sunday terrorist attacks were an extreme manifestation of intolerance People in many parts of the country lit fire crackers when Former President Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed in a suicide attack by the LTTE on May 1 1993 and people in many southern parts of the country shared kiribath and lit crackers over the killing of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran by the army on May 19 2009 The hate and aversion against the Ranasinghe Premadasa government overshadowed the jubilation of a section of the people over the custodial killing of JVP founder leader Rohana Wijeweera by the army One would wonder whether there were people in this country who hated these men but did not rejoice when the news of these incidents first reached them However everybody accepts in public that praying for the death of others or taking pleasure at their deaths does not go well with the accepted norms in the society But feeling jubilant or weeping over a death is something innate and effortless though the former might be inhumane Therefore many do not let their hearts out However their affiliations political or otherwise would speak Some preach humanity while hiding their real feelings Others express their feelings sometimes openly or through fake accounts in social media The elation or sorrow mainly depends on the relationship with the deceased Government members are lamenting these days that fake account holders of social media are praying for their deaths by way of praying for the bliss of Nirvana for them Nivan Sepa Lebewa However it was just months ago that they too took pleasure over the deaths of some of the Aragalaya activists Exactly one year after the attack on the protesters at Galle Face Green former Minister Rohith Abeygunawardena on May 9 last year pleasurably said so in Parliament He said One Kattadiya who performed a ritual to remove the President at the Aragalaya site was later killed in a lightning strike Thats number one There was a library at the Aragalaya and the librarian committed suicide The person who made Vesak lanterns in black is now at the National Institute of Mental Health Angoda Another main activist was killed after being hit by a train The person who insulted Mahinda Rajapaksa died suddenly in Lanka Hospital Werent these expressions of joy Politics has not always been peaceful wherever in the world as it is a struggle for power and thereby a hunt for wealth and resources Hence except for a few leaders like President DB Wijetunga all others have resorted to violent methods to suppress opposition and dissent prompting both oppressors and the oppressed to pray for the death of people on the other side and to celebrate overtly or covertly the deaths of others Jubilation over the deaths of political leaders has been more evident if they are brutal despotic or repressive as people take the opportunity to release their pressure that had been accumulated over time During the Premadasa administration tens of thousands of people were abducted and killed mainly by the forces and groups supporting the then government and those who rebelled against the government The LTTE killed anybody who seemed not to be prepared to toe their line Hence a sense of relief was released in the form of lighting fire crackers when Premadasa Ranjan Wijeratne Prabakaran and Wijeweera were killed Therefore the current situation can be deemed to be a collective degeneration of the society It could apparently be minimized only by minimizing repressive actions by the state and deradicalizing the society"

worldwide are probably sick and tired of seeing and hearing the triumph of evil and injustice Each time they hoped for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip so that the besieged people could breathe the air of melancholic freedom they were dealt yet another blow by the war party The latest is what followed the International Court of Justices ruling on January 26 The world court ruled by a majority decision that Israel should take all measures within its power to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip The court also ordered Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza Although it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire most jurists believe a ceasefire is implied The ICJ ruling on South Africas application to end the genocide in Gaza brought a pyrrhic victory of sorts for the Gazans and the worlds peaceandjustice constituency that backs the Palestinian cause Alas even before the toner inks carbon particles on the court papers were blown away by the courtroom air the Palestinians faced another collective punishment Upon allegations that some 13 Palestinian staff of the United Nations Works and Relief Organisation had taken part in the October 7 Hamas attack on Israeli civilians the United States Britain Germany Italy France and several other Western nations announced the suspension of funds to the humanitarian agency The big shock is Japan once considered the citadel of global pacifism Just because Japan depends on the United States to protect itself from any security threat from China it need not stoop morally so low as to join the imperial bandwagon to impose collective punishment on the hapless Palestinians Commendable however is the diplomatic courage Norway Spain Belgium and Ireland displayed in their refusal to cut funds to UNRWA despite heavy Israeli and US pressure How could the USled imperial West be so stonehearted and psychopathic while Gaza is experiencing one of the worlds worst humanitarian crises since World War II ended One wonders whether the leaders of these countries relish the deaths of Palestinian children and civilians Or are the leaders suffering from what psychiatrists call antisocial personality disorder a mental health condition characterised by a disregard for the rights of others a lack of empathy and a tendency to engage in criminal and violent behaviour The fundcutters are a bunch of hypocrites Did they cut funds to the UN peacekeeping force and other UN agencies such as UNICEF whose members have been convicted or accused of raping women and children during UN missions If this is not hypocrisy then what is it And these are the leaders who at international forums shout themselves hoarse calling for a rulebased international order The fundcutters are simply endorsing Zionist extremists argument that UNRWA is a major obstacle to their plan to annex Gaza In December a leaked Israeli foreign ministry document suggested the elimination of UNRWA Moreover Knesset members representing extremist religious parties have also called for the abolition of UNRWA Palestinian human rights groups have described the fund cut as an attempt to cause death by starvation Nay it is genocide by starvation Four months of relentless bombing according to conservative estimates have so far killed 27000 Palestinians and wounded more than 65000 people A majority of the dead and wounded are children and women in keeping with the genocide recipe Removing UNRWA will ensure hundreds of thousands of deaths by starvation It is a faster less expensive and less blameworthy way to commit genocide The USled proIsraeli Western alliance has just signed a genocide warrant for 23 million Palestinians while dismissing appeals from the worlds humanitarian community In a joint appeal 21 international organisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said they were deeply concerned and outraged at the decision taken to cut funds for UNRWA amid a rapidly worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza They said the suspension of funding by donor states would impact lifesaving assistance for more than two million civilians more than half of whom are children who rely on UNRWA aid in Gaza The population faces starvation looming famine and an outbreak of disease under Israels continued indiscriminate bombardment and deliberate deprivation of aid in Gaza UNRWA was set up in 1950 especially to deal with Palestinians displaced by the Zionist project Today some six million Palestinian refugees living in Gaza the West Bank and 58 refugee camps spread across the region depend on UNRWA for food education and employment Awardwinning British journalist and global justice activist Jonathan Cook in a post on X explains the Zionist design behind the UNRWAs creation He says UNRWA is separate from the UNs main refugee agency the UNHCR United Nations High Commission for Refugees and deals only with Palestinian refugees Although Israel does not want you to know it the reason for there being two UN refugee agencies is because Israel and its western backers insisted on the division back in 1948 Why Because Israel was afraid of the Palestinians falling under the responsibility of the UNHCRs forerunner the International Refugee Organisation The IRO was established in the immediate wake of the Second World War in large part to cope with the millions of European Jews fleeing Nazi atrocities Israel did not want the two cases treated as comparable because it was pushing hard for Jewish refugees to be settled on lands from which it had just expelled Palestinians Part of the IROs mission was to seek the repatriation of European Jews Israel was worried that this very principle might be used both to deny it to the Jews it wanted to colonise Palestinian land and to force it to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their former homes So in a real sense UNRWA is Israels creature it was set up to keep the Palestinians a case apart an anomaly Back in 2018 for example the refugee agency was plunged into an existential crisis when President Donald Trump acquiesced to Israeli pressure and cut all its funding Even after the decision was reversed the agency has been limping along financially The fundcut move comes amidst disturbing signals from the region that the Gaza war could trigger a regionwide or even a world war after three US soldiers were killed in an attack launched by a proIranian Iraqi resistance group on a secret US base in Jordan The US vowed a tough response which could even mean an attack on Iran But Teheran was equally strong in its reply It said it would decisively respond to any US attack on Iran Apart from exposing Israels and its Western allies genocidal intentions the whole UNRWA fundcut issue has sorted out the wicked from the good as far as humanitarianism is concerned Samuel Huntington propounded a clash of civilizations between cultures and religions in the postCold War world But the Gaza war has unleashed a different clash of civilizations one between those who advocate for global justice peace and freedom for the Palestinians and those who push for wars relish the killing of children and civilians and support and fund colonialism occupation ethnic cleansing and genocide"

        "body": "With the current traffic the airline is in a perfect position to feed it to Australia China Japan Singapore depending on where the connecting traffic is That is where the big opportunity lies The commercial opportunity is huge The risk is more about the country politics and the currency There is huge potential for the national carrier given Indias booming economy Growing is a real challenge due to lack of aircraft engines and spare parts Chief Executive Officer of SriLankan Airlines Richard Nuttall in an interview with Daily Mirror discussed the way forward and the current challenges of the national carrier in the midst of efforts by the government to restructure it Excerpts of the interview Q SriLankan Airlines is the most cashstrapped government institution at the moment You suffered losses amounting to US 525 million We sometimes do our accounts What sometimes people do is they look at the exchange loss So for instance we had US 1 billion debt When the currency devalued 180 billion in LKR suddenly became 360 billion in LKR If you start looking at the LKR results you say weve lost because its doubled But actually the US dollar component is just the same It is still a billion US dollars If you look at our accounts in US dollars for 2022 2023 we broke even We made US 4 million Q You have an idea about the performance of the current financial year What is your assessment You are correct We have a huge amount of debt that we have to restructure The reality is that the airline has lost money over many years It had to pay interest on that We then had COVID when every airline in the world lost money Youre paying for aircraft and engines that are sitting on the ground The biggest problem for Sri Lankan Airlines is the cash situation It is a fact that we have a lot of debt The real big problem is that we cant borrow So we have to do everything with our own cash flow This industry is a very low margin industry We have to pay for past debt If we have a bad year and cant borrow money we dont exist We have to pay off our debts We are breaking even But breaking even isnt enough because were still having to pay We have to pay RollsRoyce for contract issues that go back to 2015 Q We have to pay a lot of money to restore LEAP engines engines on the 320 neo fleet that came off the aircraft in 2021 What it means is that we dont need to just break even We need to earn 5060 million more than breaking even to pay everybody If youre going to pay off all of this debt you need to grow That is now very difficult in the world today If you went back two or three years as we were coming out of COVID the world had a lot of spare aircraft You could get aircraft very cheap We were going to take advantage of that Then the country had its issues and went into the bond default When you go into a bond default nobody is going to give you an aircraft until they can see whats happening Weve come out of the other side of the bond default and things are being restructured What weve discovered after COVID is that there arent enough aircraft in the world What happened during COVID was that engineers and technicians left the industry The manufacturers stopped manufacturing because you couldnt put people together in COVID Nobody was building planes engines and spare parts Some people who know how to do that left the industry And at the same time nobody was being trained to replace them because nobody was trained during COVID You cant learn to work on an aircraft engine by doing it on a computer You have to stand by the engine with other people or a little bit of both The issue has been made worse by the fact that the new generation engines have had a lot of problems Around 2014 2015 new generation engines came out You had the Pratt Whitney engine and the CFM engine that they were going to put on the 320neos and the 737 MAX aircraft What they all promised was that they would reduce fuel burn by 15 percent That is good for the environment and the airlines because fuel is your biggest cost Its 40 percent All of these engines are failing So our problem is not just that we cant grow We actually have a problem keeping our existing fleet in the air because we cant get engines And when we have an aircraft that has a problem we cant get spares because they dont exist This is not just a Sri Lankan problem If you look in India youll find over 100 aircraft grounded because they dont have engines We have three or four What it means is that if you want to grow its very difficult Everybody is looking for aircraft We have one 320 aircraft thats leased Its lease finishes in maybe 15 months time The people who own that aircraft which is 14 years old have already been approached by four different very large airlines One of them is a big Gulf carrier Two of them are airlines that would never ever before go for a used aircraft This aircraft is probably the most used aircraft in the world Everybody who has an aircraft will ask Shall we put this aircraft into Sri Lanka where you have an airline with a lot of debt and a country where 18 months ago you couldnt get your dollars out of the country Or do I give it to a big European carrier or a Gulf carrier So we have this perfect storm that makes it very difficult to get aircraft now It is a problem for everybody with aircrafts to keep them flying because of the engine difficulties and the spare parts issues So at a time when we need to grow to pay off our debts were actually struggling to keep our full fleet flying Q In this context we have set a target to restructure the airline by June How challenging is it to achieve this target under the current circumstances So I think there are two aspects Part of our problem is the same as everybody which means that its quite hard getting access to aircraft and growing And part of our problem is the fact that we have no cash which means that when people have aircraft we are the last people to get them We have the commercial opportunity if you can get aircraft We are in Sri Lanka right next to India with all of the growth in India The commercial opportunity is huge The risk is more about the country politics and the currency Again if you want to invest in a company youre going to be a little bit worried about it If I make money can I take my dollars out of the country So the economic situation here is part of the risk But the commercial opportunity is very good Q Can you explain a bit more about commercial opportunities At the moment India has maybe half an aircraft per million population China has three aircraft per million population The United States has 30 aircraft per million population Even in Sri Lanka we have one aircraft per million of population You have to remember India is 65 times bigger than here in population India is also growing very fast So for a long time India didnt grow but China was growing Now its a bit the other way around The rule in this business is that if GDP grows by X air travel will grow by three times So if Indias GDP is growing at 5 or 6 that says the demand for air travel will grow at 15 to 18 If you go to India now we talk about that half aircraft Most of it is being used for domestic travels Theyre hoping it will double in the next six years In India they dont really have enough aircraft even with these huge orders In India youve got Mumbai and Delhi These are the two big hubs Then youve got all of these cities there If youre in Cochin and you want to go to Australia there are no direct flights from Cochin So if you want to go from Cochin to the Middle East or Europe you go on a Gulf carrier We used to carry that traffic But now with the Gulf carriers it doesnt work But if you want to go to Australia you can either fly three hours this way and then three hours later if youre flying over Sri Lanka or you do a hop and you go to Australia With all of this growth and all of these cities we fly to nine and ten cities in India With that traffic were in a perfect position to feed it to Australia China Japan Singapore depending on where the connecting traffic is That is where the big opportunity is What happens is the more flights you have the more traffic well get to Sri Lanka So if you look at India at the moment the number one country for tourism to Sri Lanka is India It varies by monthyear Number two is the UK Russia sometimes in the winter but also the UK The UK is maybe 10 less The UK has a population of 50 million people 11 hours flying time away India has 14 billion an hour away or up to three hours away So the demand from India that should be coming here shouldnt be 12000 It should be 120000 But you need to have enough flights So you add flights that can bring Indians here Indians to Australia to New Zealand to wherever with those connections You have a really strong opportunity to build a hub here Q For you to increase the traffic to Colombo in that sense the facilities at our airport should also be expanded What is your view about the facilities at the airport The airport is already at capacity at the peak periods So you need a bit more discipline and spreading capacity But for us we want all the flights to arrive at the same time and we want them all to leave at the same time because then you have the connections So yes the airport needs to be bigger So it needs the second terminal But in the meantime AASL Airport and Aviation Services Ltd is working creatively to find solutions Theyre looking to put some more checkin counters Theyve identified another area in the current terminal where they can put some more checkin counters Were also putting kiosks where people can check in themselves and drop their baggage So there are ways and also using technology people will start using facial recognition and scanners So theres a way that even with the current airport we can expand the capacity by maybe by 50 percent But then in time theyll need the new terminal But if we work together we can manage it a little bit Q Despite the commercial potential Sri Lankan airlines are burdened with a huge debt burden at the moment Will these private sector investors pour in money for such a venture You know so this is being managed by the stateowned enterprise restructuring unit Its not actually being managed by the airline But you are correct I think thats why part of the IMF process was for the state institutions to restructure their balance sheets and then privatise If you dont restructure the balance sheet nobody will buy with too much debt Equally if you dont restructure the balance sheet the danger is nobody will buy Then the IMF doesnt want the government to put any more money into the airlines If the airline is not sustainable the government is going to have a choice of either putting money in or losing the airline There are two problems with that There are some routes where people will fly But many routes only work because of the connecting traffic So for instance our flights to Australia only work because we have connecting traffic from India So if we dont exist you will not have direct flights to Australia Maybe some of those Indian routes wont be there if theres no connecting traffic So that reason is there all the time You need somebody here whos based here as a hub if you want to have the same number of flights The other issue is that there are not enough aircraft in the world at the moment So for anybody who wants to come and set up a new airline or anybody who wants to expand the chances are that theyre going to have to wait three four or five years to get aircraft So the danger is if something happens to us tomorrow theres going to be a whole lot of capacity in the country that nobody is going to fly Q As an expert in the industry and also as the CEO of Sri Lankan Airlines what kind of proposals have you put forward to this restructuring unit headed by Mr Suresh Shah Well so we have sat down with Suresh Shah and we have given them the background and our thoughts about the industry and why its important and how connectivity works and all of these things But what we also told them to do or what we also suggested they do was that they were using IFC International Financial Corporation to manage the transaction But airlines are a very specialised business What we suggested and what they also did was that the IFC worked with some aviation specialists so that they could work with the government on the valuation and could help market the airline If we were privately owned obviously we would do it ourselves But even if we did it ourselves we would use somebody to assist us When SOERU calls us we provide as much data as we can However we painted the picture for them at the start but now theyre running with it Q Are the countries such as India and China showing any strategic interest in acquiring the airline This is what I understand alternatively We are not part of the SOERU although we do know people who are there We understand that they had a Zoom call a call for people to ask questions when they first of all put out the document for Expressions of Interest We understand that seven or eight people participated in that call and none of them were airlines some international some domestic We also understand that some of those people asked for time to see if they could get together to form consortiums So they extended the deadline until February Maybe nobody will know who is interested until they open up the EOI Q In Sri Lanka SriLankan Airlines is identified with national pride as in any other country How valid is this concept of the national carrier in the current global context It is actually very valid I think it depends a little bit where you are If youre in Europe where essentially in Europe you have open skies you have airlines from one country that have hubs in another So you know you have carriers like WizzAir and Ryanair that have hubs all over Europe So its not quite as important there But if you are an island or if youre somewhere thats like an island because you have zones around you without good transport or where there may be conflict then your airline is quite important because you rely on it for connectivity you rely on it to connect passengers you rely on it for freight And what happens is that foreign airlines will only fly according to economic conditions whereas your national airline will also try to support you when you need it If you look at COVID if you go back to 2022 when the country had its problems the foreign airlines were all pulling out and reducing flights because they couldnt repatriate their dollars So at that time the national airline was very very important Because again without us a lot of people wouldnt have been able to connect whether for business whether for tourism or whether to go overseas or even to work You know even if youre a diaspora and you want to go to work in Australia or Europe or the Gulf or Korea or wherever you need to be able to get there During COVID we played a key role in transporting goods and medicine When things are difficult thats when you need a national carrier When everything is booming and everybody has lots of aircraft maybe its not quite so important As a country Sri Lanka had a few issues over time So having a national carrier that makes sure you have those connections is very important"

in inadequate constitutional or institutional restraints on how government power is used That is exactly the kind of problem that the new Central Bank Act is designed to solve Congratulations to the Supreme Court for finding three Rajapaksa brothers two former Central Bank Governors and two former Treasury Secretaries guilty of the sustained economic mismanagement that led to the 2022 economiccumdebt crisis The judgement is at the frontier of jurisprudence There is no precedent for this kind of ruling about such a broad and complex policy question But the incompetence was so gross and visible that the court could rule with confidence Some of the policies notably the giveaways of potential tax revenue in 2019 and the insistence in 20202022 on continuing to repay foreign debts when the Treasury was clearly about to go broke were not just contentious They were inane But what about the deeper causes What about Sri Lankas constitution law or governing institutions that have enabled successive governments to implement pernicious fiscal and economic policies so obviously contrary to national interests There seems to be a consensus that corruption is a major problem The countrys rulers have been more focused on enrichment than on the essential challenges of financial and economic management Corruption and the blatant abuse of power have rightly been the central concerns refer to the recent Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report on Sri Lanka by the Civil Society Initiative on AntiCorruption Reform for Economic Recovery and the IMFs Sri Lanka Technical Assistance Report Governance Diagnostic Assessment Not all economic mismanagement or misuse of public money stem directly from visible corruption or from blatant abuse of power Some of the harmful policies that rulers use to advantage themselves are quite legal The problems lie in inadequate constitutional or institutional restraints on how government power is used That is exactly the kind of problem that the new Central Bank Act is designed to solve Previously it was quite legal for governments to use various tools to persuade the Central Bank to permit the government to spend significantly more money than it raised That persuasion was practiced almost every year Governments benefitted from greater popularity citizens suffered from high inflation without understanding the reasons Future governments will not cease trying to persuade the Central Bank to print money for them But the Bank now has more latitude to say no More of these kinds of reforms are needed to cut the government down to size and make it accountable One issue has not yet received the attention it deserves the fact that for the past three and a half decades since April 1989 Sri Lanka has not had a proper Finance Minister Someone has always held that title Exceptionally from 20172019 Mangala Samaraweera held the title and did the job He enjoyed personal political authority and the backing of the Prime Minister He at least tried to coordinate government revenue raising and spending and to rein in the pressures from other Ministers to spend without constraint He was the first Finance Minister in a long time to pay serious attention to tax policy and tax administration He even masterminded some limited positive tax reforms Other than Samaraweera a couple of the people who have briefly held the post of Finance Minister since 1988 have been figureheads For most of that period the post has been held by the incumbent President It follows that the PresidentMinister of Finance could not exercise any independent influence over economic and fiscal policy or query or check government financial decisions Not only were Presidents too busy to be effective Ministers of Finance they also entrusted the post of Secretary to close confidants who had almost unchallenged authority and wide unofficial political responsibilities Between 1989 and 2022 four people held the post of Secretary to the Minister of Finance for significant periods of time R Paskaralingam R H S Samaratunga PB Jayasundera and S R Attygalle The last two were among the seven people CC1 recently found guilty of economic mismanagement by the Supreme Court PB Jayasundera was Finance Secretary for a total of 13 years under Presidents Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa He was also Secretary to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from 2019 to 2022 This arrangement prioritised the political authority of the President over economic and fiscal management which has been neglected This is very evident in relation to the revenue collection machinery Before Mangala Samaraweera Ronnie de Mel was the last Finance Minister to pay this serious attention back in the 1980s One reason that we face the current paradox of acutely inadequate tax collection and highly dissatisfied taxpayers is that the Inland Revenue Department is still organised and equipped for the twentieth century rather than the twenty first A

social media celebrated his death What a great day to wake up to said one poster in the Sri Lankan X formerly Twitter Fake news and doctored imagery amplified that rancour A photo widely shared on social media platforms was revealed as an old imagery of the public in Borella celebrating the resignation of Nishanthas political patron Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2022 Public anger at the system can obscure a bigger picture of an assortment of defects that led to the economic and political decay of the country Subpar individuals in politics are only part of the problem the bigger malady is the destructive economic and social policies their governments followed to keep their constituencies satiated for the time being Mr Nishantha was a foot soldier of the Rajapaksa regime and like most of his peers of the same ilk he prided in their sycophantic loyalty to the Rajapaksas He rose in politics at a time Sri Lanka underwent a period of extreme bastardization of its politics Many Sri Lankans blame JR Jayawardene for setting off this degenerative process which has overtime robbed the honour and public respect of the elected office At the same time politicians got rich in the system that placed little value on personal and professional integrity This erosion of the quality of the political class probably happened before JRs Presidency when SWRD Bandaranaike opened floodgates preferring to capitalize on the local intimacy of the candidates to any idea of intellectual or professional sophistication Or it is an inevitable function of the electoral democracy But of all the people Mahinda Rajapaksa took it to the extreme end He adopted a group of young MPs including the refuse from other parties such as Duminda Silva who was sacked from the UNP after an alleged sexual assault on a woman and promoted them purely on the ranking of their sycophantic loyalty to him and his family While the young MPs were the court jesters and guard dogs of the Rajapaksa fiefdom seniors like GL Peiris nannied the Rajapaksa scions to groom the dynastys next generation All were the accessories of the dynastic enterprise relishing whatever the breadcrumbs thrown on their way Such a system blinded by an overbearing familial interest cannot last longer and it crashed during an interim phase of the dynastic succession of Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was sent as a seat warmer until Presidential scion Namal was ready The Rajapaksas alone could not have unleashed the political and economic decay as acute as it had later proved to be without the help of their sidekicks Many have internalized the same economic model that was the root cause of the economic collapse And charlatans who are no different from their opponents are offering the sun and the moon without addressing the elephant in the room Interestingly though some of the same young MPs some of whom are Ministers in this government have proved to be competent administrators of their portfolios perhaps more accomplished than their seniors when they were given the freedom of action Liberty was not available under the Rajapaksa regime when the first family controlled the lions share of the government budget and made all key decisions guided by the simple and selfish calculations of perpetuating the familial hold on power However Nishantha held no such latent genius A school leaver who joined politics soon after he climbed the ranks purely by his sycophantic loyalty So much so that he paid the overdue electricity bill of several millions of rupees of Namal Rajapaksas wedding Such gestures could still be more transactional a reciprocal act in a welloiled patronage network that the Rajapksas managed through the state funds A Mirror Image of the Hated System The public reaction to Nishanthas death is not necessarily aimed at Nishantha himself Rather it is a public display of repulsion against the political system he was part of That political system promoted nincompoops who brought in nothing in intellectual sophistication or personal integrity It is now facing its worstever crisis of legitimacy The public considers Parliament a den of thieves and holds all 225 members accountable for the current plight of the country Much of the everyday resentment at the political system tends to find scapegoats everywhere but makes little mention of reforming the statist captive economic model in the grip of the SOEs and local wheelerdealers Without dismantling the restrictive market barriers and liberalizing the economy Sri Lankans would be trapped in a low growth underperforming economy that begets many other social woes including corruption and nepotism However public anger at the system can obscure a bigger picture of an assortment of defects that led to the economic and political decay of the country Subpar individuals in politics are only part of the problem the bigger malady is the destructive economic and social policies their governments followed to keep their constituencies satiated for the time being It was the aggregate impact of the flawed economic policies that accelerated the economic collapse However much of the everyday resentment at the

However many who find fault with the government which State Minister Nishantha was part of for the economic misery offer no realistic economic solutions to the countrys long persisting problems Instead many have internalized the same economic model that was the root cause of the economic collapse And charlatans who are no different from their opponents are offering the sun and the moon without addressing the elephant in the room Few have ever called out this duplicity Probably it is this intellectual poverty in our time that elects the likes of Sanath Nishantha to the political

        "headline": "The Contribution of Siam and Burma to Buddhism in Sri Lanka",
        "body": "It is well known that monks from Siam and Burma as Thailand and Myanmar were called earlier helped stem a decline in the practice of Buddhism and contributed to its democratization in Sri Lanka during certain periods in the islands history The circumstances which necessitated help from Siam and Burma the process of securing such help the role of the Dutch in it and the results of foreign involvement are vividly described by Auckland University sociologist Kitsiri Malalgoda in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 17501900 Tambapanni Academic Publishers Colombo 2023 Because of the hilly terrain Kandy was relatively isolated from the rest of the island and Western influence was minimal there The seclusion of Kandy enabled its kings to nurture Buddhist institutions Buddhist monks were so much privileged there that they were given even administrative posts In 1731 the chief monk of Poyamalu Vihare was also a Basnayaka Nilame a temple custodian who is usually a lay man and a Disava District Governor too During the rule of King Rajasinha II 16351687 it was a monk Kobbekaduwe Ganebandara who conducted political negotiations with the Dutch At that time the Kandyans were liaising with the Dutch in order to throw the troublesome Portuguese out of the island Because of the physical security Kandy enjoyed new temples were built and old ones were renovated Kandyan kings welcomed monks from the Western coastal areas and the Low Country who were fleeing from the proselytizing Portuguese All this made the clergy pretty influential and the kings quite willingly pampered them with land grants But as the British historian Lord Acton said power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely The powerful monks of Kandy bent rules to serve their personal material interests From the 13th Century onwards the Kandyan kings started donating lands to individual monks contrary to the Buddhist Vinaya regulations Monks became custodians of temple properties when that role should be played by laymen The rules required the custodian to pass on his power to a pupil But the pupil chosen to inherit would be a kinsman of the monk who had entered monkhood primarily only to inherit the property This way temples went into the hands of the Kandyan aristocracy It was not uncommon for a monk to leave the order and take to a secular vocation after handing over the temple property to a pupil who is a relation Prof Malalgoda points out Those who joined the order under these conditions were not in it for spiritual reasons but to preserve property rights within their families These monks were illtrained and not ordained as per Vinaya rules With the result the institution of monks suffered A stage was reached when there were few qualified monks to perform Upasampada or the higher ordination of monks Sensing the deterioration King Vimaladharmasuriya I 15911604 and King Vimaladharmasuriya II 16871707 tried to reestablish higher ordination with the help of monks from Burmas Arakan region The Burmese monks came in 1697 and Velivita Saranankara 1698 1778 who was to bring about a tremendous change in Sri Lankan Buddhist practice later was ordained by them However unfortunately after King Vimaladharmasuriya II died in 1707 the kingdoms interest in improving spiritual matters ceased Royal neglect resulted in Vinaya rules being violated Many monks ceased to be celibate and maintained families with funds from the temples Instead of preaching the Buddhist doctrine they became practitioners of astrology sorcery and exorcism banned by Buddhism points out Prof Malalgoda It was at this time that Velivita Saranankara launched the Silvat Samagama Pious Fraternity Prior to this he had retired to the mountainous area of Alagalla and devoted his time to meditation and learning Pali His piety attracted a following and the group that emerged came to be known as Silvat Samagama To keep the purity of the group Saranankara revived the traditional practice of holding fortnightly confessional sessions to check if Vinaya rules were followed Saranankara received the patronage of the then King Sri Veera Parakrama Narendrasingha 17071739 who helped him establish a Buddhist educational centre at Niyamakanda But Saranankara was keen on training monks for higher ordination Upsampada He was able to do that during the reign of King Narendrasinghas successor Sri Vijaya Rajasingha 17391747 King Sri Vijaya Rajasingha the brotherinlaw of King Narendrasingha was a South Indian To make himself acceptable to his Sinhalese subjects he became a Buddhist and did all he could do promote Buddhism He commenced negotiations with the Dutch to charter a vessel to bring Siamese monkteachers to Sri Lanka In 1741 a delegation comprising two officials of the King and five followers of Saranankaras set sail for Siam But the mission failed as the ship floundered off Pegu in Burma Undaunted Saranankara sent another mission in 1745 headed by Doranagama Muhandiram This reached Siam in 1747 and met King Maha Tammaraja 17331758 But the king was reluctant to send his monks to Sri Lanka because he had heard by then that King Sri Vijaya Rajasingha had died and was not sure if his successor would entertain the Siamese mission But fortunately the new king Kirti Sri Rajasingha 17471782 who was the brotherinlaw of Sri Vijaya Rajasingha was very keen on promoting Buddhism and getting down Siamese monks Like Sri Vijaya Rajasingha King Kirti Sri Rajasingha was also a South Indian who had to prove that he would promote Buddhism The Dutch were again approached to arrange a vessel They obliged and a delegation of five officials and 61 others left for Siam in 1750 The Siamese king sent a team of 25 monks led by Upali Thera The team arrived in Sri Lanka in 1753 amidst great rejoicing The kings ministers escorted them to Kandy and King Kirti Sri Rajasingha received them warmly Upali Thera and his team of monks were put up in the Malwathu Vihare in Kandy The first Upasampada ceremony was held at a consecrated Sima at Malwathu Vihare on a full moon day in Asala JuneJuly in 1753 The second Sima was established in the Asgiri Vihare Upali Thera travelled around the island and set up Simas at several Vihares and conducted Upasampada Upali Theras mission motivated many to join the Buddhist order Interest in a true monastic life grew rapidly Enthused by this the king of Siam sent a second group of monks in 1756 under Visuddhacharya who was a master of meditation techniques and Varananamuni who was well versed in the Buddhist doctrine The Thai team thoroughly overhauled the Kandyan Perahera ceremonial procession It had become a parade of Hindu Gods and deities The Buddha was conspicuously missing This reflected the Kandyan kings kinship with South Indian rulers They were under South Indian influence The Siamese monks changed the format reintroducing the Dalada Perahera in which the Buddha was given primacy The Perahera in this form symbolically reestablished the primacy of Buddhism within the Sinhalese religious system Prof Malalgoda observed There was a marked spurt in Vihara building during the rule of King Kirti Sri Rajasingha It covered all parts of the island says the art historian Ananda Coomaraswamy But though King Kirti Sri Rajasingha had become a Buddhist to be king and did a lot for Buddhism he was personally a Saivite sporting the holy ash Vibhuthi on his forehead This was a cause of a revolt against him in 1760 which he crushed Be that as it may Buddhist revival continued under King Kirti Sri Rajasinghas successor King Rajadhi Rajasingha 17821798 King Rajadhi Rajasingha spent a lot of money even using income from his own royal villages called Gabadagam Between the two Rajasinghas places of worship in Anuradhapura Polonnaruwa Mahiyangana and Kelaniya were renovated Since Kandy was the centre of Buddhism the Malwatte and Asgiriya Vihares became heads of the Buddhist order and all Vihares in the island were placed under one or the other of these two Nikayas fraternities However the Malwatte and Asgiriya Nikayas were the exclusive preserve of the Goyigamas the top most caste in Sri Lanka But a time came when the Karavas Duravas and the Salagamas felt the need to have their own establishments In 1799 Ambagahapitiye Nyanavimala a Salagama monk proceeded to Burma with five novices Samaneras to get ordination there When they reached Amarapura which was the capital of Burma they were received by King Bodawpaya 17821819 The Sri Lankans got their ordination done by the Burmese monk Sangaraja Nyanabhivamsa in 1800 When they came back they set up their own Simas in South Sri Lanka and performed Upasampadas The new fraternity came to be known as the Amarapura Nikaya and the Kandyan Nikayas Malwatte and Asgiriya came to be known as the Siam Nikayas"

without an acknowledgement of the contribution of Sir Robert Wilmot Horton to Ceylon Both Horton and Arunachalam contributed to Ceylons allround development each in his own way and as per the opportunities available in their time Sir Robert Wilmot Horton was Governor of Ceylon between 1831 and 1837 and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam was a polymath lawyer educationist public intellectual and

Colonial Legacy Laksiri Jayasuriya Journal of the RAS Vol 46 2001 pp 68 The Europeans perceiving themselves as the dominant white race believed in the natural conquest of inferior people for the betterment of mankind viewing it as an expression of natures law While national heroes like P Sirisena and Tibatian Mahinda Thera as well as Indian legend Rabindranath Tagore in his poetry collection Gitanjali explored themes of freedom spirituality and nationalism inspiring nationalists Sir Arunachalam and Gandhi to resist colonial invaders Europe produced poets like Rudyard Kipling who wrote The White Mans Burden in 1897 This poem framed imperialism and colonialism as a moral duty for the white race to uplift nonwhite civilizations During Robert Hortons tenure in Ceylon he was tasked with implementing the recommendations of the ColebrookeCameron Commission a result of pressure exhorted by local agitators in the early 19th century which led to the establishment of Ceylons First Legislative Council and Executive Committee Horton 3rd Baronet 17841841 a British politician sociopolitical theorist and colonial administrator served as the UnderSecretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1821 to 1828 he later assumed the role of Governor of Ceylon from 1831 to 1837 His notable contributions extend to his writings on the subject of assisted emigration to the colonies within the British Empire The practice of disposing of national assets to foreign businessmen was initiated by Horton marking a regrettable trend Arunachalam the first Ceylonese to enter CCS was deprived of the position of Government Agent in Colombo and posted subsequently to judicial posts across the island This reflected an unofficial policy of the British Government at the time which systematically prevented exceptional Ceylonese individuals from assuming prominent roles within the government In 1906 Arunachalam was appointed to the Legislative Council His groundbreaking Census Report of 1901 was hailed by The Times of London as the most comprehensive authority on the ethnology of Ceylon and of its varied people their history their religions languages and literature James T Rutnum Sir PonnambalamArunachalam Scholar and Statesman 18531924 1953 pp 11 In 1913 a new phase in Arunachalams life began In this year he joined a political movement demanding selfgovernance for the people of Ceylon In an historic lecture entitled Our Political Needs given at the insistence of DR Wijewardene Arunachalam crystallised the arguments for selfgovernment In 1915 he was elected as the inaugural President of the Ceylon Social Service League dedicated to uplifting the poorer classes in Ceylon In 1917 Arunachalam founded the Ceylon Reform League In 1919 he delivered an address at a Sinhalese conference supported by FR Senanayake with the aim of organizing Peoples Associations across Sinhalese districts for political social and economic improvement This initiative directly led to the establishment of the Lanka Maha Jana Sabha Arunachalam was the Father of the Ceylon University Movement played a pivotal role in establishing the Ceylon University Association in January 1906 In a memorandum to Governor Sir West Ridgeway he requested the formation of a commission to assess educational progress and need surging the creation of a Ceylon University only to receive a negative response from the Governor Following his death the Ceylon Daily News described him as the most powerful personality in Ceylon and the Times of London hailed him as the Founder of modern Ceylon The next significant acknowledgement of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam came from the late and esteemed Mr DR Wijewardene a close friend and admirer In 1948 on the occasion of Ceylons independence Mr Wijewardene despite being in retirement and unwell rose from his sick bed Reflecting on events over three decades earlier in the Ceylon Daily News he wrote In those days the national consciousness was dormant and there was nothing in the spirit of the times to stir it to life and activity Later largely as a result of Arunachalams work the fire of the national soul was quickened Discussing Hortons tenure in detail in a paper titled Governor Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and the Reforms of 1833 in Ceylon Vijaya Samaraweera says There is no doubt that he particularly disliked the creation of the legislature for at the time of his appointment as Bathurst the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1812 to 1827 stated he had the satisfaction of being free from legislative assemblies Instinct and experience had their place but what emerges more clearly is that he acted with a conscious need to safeguard the power and privileges as the Governor This perhaps is understandable as the Governor of Ceylon he received far less than what he originally desired for when seeking a colonial appointment he was not attracted to Ceylon but to Canada Under British rule Ceylon acknowledged as the premier colony served as a testing ground for British ideals in social and political institutions In fact Sri Lanka had been proposed as the prototype and model for the new Commonwealth in the latter part of the 20th century The Historical Journal Vol 15 No 2 Jun 1972 pp 220 While representing an oppressive regime Horton may have played a positive role in implementing certain democratic and social reforms recommended by the ColebrookeCameron Commission a responsibility assigned to him This distinguishes him from more infamous governors such as Chalmers Torrington MacDonald or William Rogers However it is crucial to note that Horton the colonial agent was also instrumental in promoting the arrack industry through free distribution of arrack The commission recommended the abolition of the feudal practice of compulsory labour abandon governments claims to free service Rajakariya recognising the right to private property ending of the governments monopoly of the Cinnamon trade starting the first newspaper of Ceylon the Colombo Journal and the first mail coach in Asia reformed the education system reforms to the Civil Service and established Ceylons first public school the Colombo Academy which was renamed in 1881 as the Royal College It also recommended a drastic reduction on powers of the Governor The credit for the aforementioned reforms belongs to the Commission and the national heroes who advocated for them rather than Horton While Horton acquiesced to the changes in 1831 two years later he was no longer willing to do so Importantly in opposing the reforms of 1833 Hortons motivations were not solely driven by the selfinterest of preserving the power and position of the Governor He opposed specific reforms beneficial to the colony deeming them detrimental to the Empires interests This principled stance was notably evident in his negative approach and resistance to the reforms in the civil service of Ceylon The direction in which the Colonial Office was moving at this juncture was clearly indicated to Horton himself at the time of his appointment He was aware that in these days of Reduction measures he had to accept the governorship at a reduced salary During the Age of Imperialism 16th to 19th century European nations aggressively expanded driven by economic needs stemming from the Industrial Revolution This era of scientific and technological development transformed rural societies into industrialized ones Imperial powers set up trading posts gained footholds and collaborated with local rulers to protect European economic interests Motivated by political aspirations for national greatness and beliefs in Western superiority they employed military force economic influence and annexation to dominate Africa and Asia By 1914 Great Britain controlled the largest number of colonies symbolized by the phrase the sun never sets on the British Empire Colonialism was and remains a wholesale destruction of memory Lands the sources of identity stolen Languages ripped from mouths The collective loss to humanity was incalculable as cultures ideas species habitats traditions cosmologies possibilities patterns of life and ways of understanding the world were destroyed Countless ecological traditions involving diverse ways of being with nature were swept away The majestic mountainous terrain initially known as Maha Eliya Thenna was renamed Horton Plains National Park in 1834 by Lt William Fisher of the 78th Regiment and Lt Albert Watson of the 58th Regiment The legitimacy of the two military men to rename it is questionable Let Horton Place and Plains remain unchanged if that is the preference of residents and aligns with tourism demands However upon the inauguration of the proposed ColomboJaffna Highway let us honour this great personality by naming it after him In the past local communities were inclined to venerate the white invaders actively seeking their favour in exchange for privileges such as nindagams free grant of thousands of acres of crown land and coveted MudliarMuhandiram positions This historical practice of seeking patronage from colonial powers became deeply ingrained in the collective mindset of the locals Breaking free from this entrenched historical mentality requires a conscious and concerted effort kksperera1gmailcom"

When it comes to decisionmaking a systemsthinking mindset can be highly beneficial Despite strong interest the relationship between systems thinking and complex decisionmaking has received consideration With the use of a skill set called systems thinking one can hope to better understand the deep roots of these complex behaviours to better predictions and ultimately adjust their outcomes With the exponential growth of systems in our world comes a growing need for systems thinkers to tackle these complex problems This need stretches far beyond the science and engineering disciplines encompassing in the truth in every aspect of life What is a Systems Thinking Approach Lets look at the example of a busy hospital where staff shortages lead to heavy workloads and staff burnout As a result many staff quit causing even more staff shortages heavier workloads and even more staff burnout Staff shortages problem in a hospital The hospital tries to solve the problem by hiring temporary staff In the short run this balances out the workload and lessens the pressure on the hospital staff The hospital managers now have less incentive to find a longlasting solution to the problem However with time the rate of medical error increases in the hospital as the temporary staff are less familiar with the established processes and procedures Ultimately the hospital staffs workload increases even more Whole Systems Thinking is a method to understand how things elements and systems are related and how they influence one another within a whole Further decisionmaking is a crucial aspect of our daily life and it can take various forms depending on the context and complexity of the circumstances You have many decisionmaking examples in your daily life simple things such as decidingchoosing what to wear what to eat which book to read and what task to do next Of these lets examine two common scenarios such as career choice and business decisions First lets look at the Career Choice Scenario a high school graduate is trying to decide between attending college and entering the workforce or pursuing a vocational program In this decisionmaking process the individual considers personal interests future career prospects financial implications and the potential for personal growth before making the decision Now lets look at the Business Decision Scenario a company is considering whether to launch a new product into the market In this DecisionMaking Process the company conducts market research analyzes potential risks and returns evaluates competition and considers the companys financial resources before deciding whether to proceed with the product launch or not So the important point to reflect on is that the decisionmaking process differs from scenario to scenario and varies in aspects Individuals often have mental models or ways of thinking about how a system works When addressing problems within a system interventions should be designed with an understanding of the broader context and potential unintended consequences Time delays in the system can impact the effectiveness of interventions Understanding these delays is essential for anticipating the timing and impact of changes Military Science From the earliest times military expertise and strategists played a crucial role in winning wars Success in combat is an essential condition of military organizations and the ultimate purpose of military equipment depend on the ability of decisionmaking and putting them to optimum use to win the battle To develop our argument we create an analytical framework for assessing the impact of military strategy on battlefield performance This framework is built by surveying and categorizing various conceptualizations of military strategy to identify propositions for how the strategy could affect the outcomes in war It is also important to reflect on the asymmetric warfare that we have experienced which is a type of war between an individual group country or other entity that acts in a hostile manner in engaging in combat whose relative military power strategy or tactics differ significantly and both may attempt to exploit each others relative weaknesses Asymmetric warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which enemy combatants are not regular military forces of a nationstate SubjectSpecific Experts Vs AllRound Experts Leadership With my experience I observe that subjectspecific experts and allround experts leadership are important in the management and execution of decisionmaking We must have an optimum ratio that suits the role and task of your organization In the present context Artificial Intelligence AI metrics could help you to shape and ease your burden of selection AI metrics refer to the quantitative measurements and indicators used to assess the performance effectiveness and various aspects of the AI system These metrics help to evaluate how well an AI model or system could function and they can be used to monitor and optimize its performance over time In the choice of AI metrics its important to tailor the choice of metrics to the specific context and goals of your organization It is also important to regularly reassess and update the metrics based on the evolving needs and challenges in the deployment of AI systems Sri Lankas military draws its heritage from the British military Being a part of the Commonwealth we continue the same rank structure as the Royal Army Navy and Air Force However Singapore being in our ASEAN neighbourhood and still being a part of the Commonwealth no longer uses the Britishstyle across its armed services Military Experts in the Singapore Armed Forces Let us focus on the Military Domain Experts Scheme MDES Singapore Armed Forces It is a separate rank scheme that was introduced in April 2010 by the Singapore Armed Forces This system has been proven to be successful and it was a smooth transformation Military Experts use their expertise in areas like technical engineering nursing and intelligence to enhance the capabilities of the military to maintain highly complicated machinery or systems to improve skills and proficiency to support the evergrowing hightech Singapore Armed Forces These Military Experts are soldiers who serve in a specific military domain Military Domain Experts Scheme which is from the civilian professional expertise in key military domains comprises a rank structure organized according to qualifications and experience Further in this approach in the military context the choice between subject experts and allround experts depends on the specific roles tasks and goals of the militaryselected expertise of the organization Both types of expertise can be valuable in different capacities The following are the considerations for each of them Subject Experts in the Military Specialized Skills Military operations often require specialized knowledge especially in areas such as strategy tactics intelligence engineering logistics and technology Subject experts can bring deep understanding and proficiency in these specific domains MissionCritical Tasks In operations that involve complex and specialized tasks having subject experts in key roles is essential For example experts in cyber security aviation or intelligence analysis can be crucial for specific military missions Training and Education Subject experts play a vital role in training and educating military personnel in specialized fields ensuring a high level of proficiency in critical areas Deep Understanding Military Leaders with subject expertise have a deep understanding of specific areas which can be crucial in industries or organizations that require specialized knowledge Credibility Subject experts often command credibility and respect from their team members because of their indepth knowledge This can contribute to effective communication and influence within the organization on decision making Strategic DecisionMaking In situations where decisions require a high level of technical or domainspecific knowledge military leaders with subject expertise may make more informed and strategic decisions AllRound Experts in the Military Adaptability Any military environment could be dynamic requiring personnel to adapt to changing situations Allround experts may be better suited for roles that involve a variety of tasks and responsibilities contributing to the overall flexibility of the military force Military Leaders with a broader skill set can be more adaptable in dynamic environments They would be better equipped to handle diverse challenges and make decisions that consider a variety of factors Interdisciplinary Collaboration Military operations often involve collaboration between different branches and specialties Allround experts can facilitate agile communication and coordination between diverse units promoting a more integrated and effective force In organizations with diverse functions and departments leaders with allaround expertise can facilitate collaboration and understanding between different teams This can lead to a more integrated and cohesive organizational culture Leadership Roles Military Leaders at higher levels of command may benefit from a broader understanding of military operations encompassing strategy logistics and personnel management Allround experts in leadership positions can provide a comprehensive perspective Effective Communication Allround experts excel in communicating complex ideas to a broader audience fostering better understanding and alignment across the organization Concluding Insights Certainly the military structure I described with a mix of subject experts and allround experts has parallels in various commercial entities especially in large organizations where leadership roles are diverse and require a range of skills By comparing hypothetical commercial organizations we can highlight the diverse approaches that businesses may take based on their industry history and strategic goals by contrasting similarities and differences Though we discussed focusing on my forte you can always compare and contrast any commercial entity taking the guidance from the same line The process remains the same fitting into a different role and type of operation In summary a systems thinking approach to decisionmaking involves a deep understanding of the complexity interdependencies and dynamics within a system It requires a holistic perspective the consideration of feedback loops and the ability to map and visualize causal relationships This approach helps decisionmakers navigate uncertainties and make more informed choices in a complex and dynamic environment that is stable and unchanging but should be better when we are facing VUCA Volatility Uncertainty Chaos and Ambiguity I wish to reiterate that a systems thinking approach is applicable across various domains including business healthcare environmental management and social systems It encourages a more comprehensive and strategic approach to problemsolving by considering the interconnectedness of elements within a system In conclusion systems thinking is an approach that views a system as an interconnected set of elements with relationships and interactions emphasizing a holistic understanding of the system as a whole This approach encourages a comprehensive perspective on complex issues helping individuals to identify and address problems by considering the interconnectedness of various elements within a system Further I wish to give credit and acknowledge the information gained from my research on webbased opensource articles The writer is formerly Commander Sri Lanka Air Force Ambassador to

        "body": "A noteworthy incident was the attack launched on the vehicle he was travelling in by unknown gunmen more than 23 years ago In the news story appearing in the Uthayan Shritharan was quoted that the attack was a planned attempt to kill him and that his Tamil political opponents who were aligned with the government for concessions and ministerial posts were responsible Shritharan has been projecting himself as a supporter and fellow traveller of the LTTE from the time he entered Parliament This has earned him bouquets from proTiger elements and brickbats from antiTiger elements While the proLTTE label has helped him in politics it has at times placed him in jeopardy too The media spotlight is focused to a great extent on Jaffna District Parliamentarian Sivagnanam Shritharan these days The 55 year old former school principal has been elected as the President of Sri Lankas premier Tamil political party the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi ITAK known in English as the Federal Party FP Shritharan has been elected an MP continuously since 2010 Shritharan contested the ITAK Presidential election on a proLTTE platform euphemistically described as Thamizh Thesiyam Tamil Nationalism The newly elected ITAK leader demonstrated that he was a hawk in Tamil politics by paying obeisance at the LTTE cemetery in Kilinochchi He also issued a statement calling upon all Tamil nationalist parties to join him and realise the dreams of fallen LTTE fighters known as Maaveerar or great heroes Shritharan has been projecting himself as a supporter and fellow traveller of the LTTE from the time he entered Parliament This has earned him bouquets from proTiger elements and brickbats from antiTiger elements While the proLTTE label has helped him in politics it has at times placed him in jeopardy too A noteworthy incident in this regard was the attack launched on the vehicle he was travelling in by unknown gunmen This attack took place on the road in the Anuradhapura district more than 23 years ago I wrote extensively about the incident then This column revisits the attack on Shritharan with the aid of those earlier writings this week According to the complaints made by Shritharan to the Police and to the then Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa what had reportedly happened then was this Parliament was to convene on March 8th 2011 Shritharan based in Kilinochchi left for Colombo on March 7th 2011 to attend sittings in the House by the Diyawanna Oya It was his usual practice to start out from Kilinochchi in the afternoon on the day before Parliament was scheduled to convene and reach Colombo after nightfall WP HG 4846 The Jaffna District MP after an early lunch started out from Kilinochchi at 100 pm in his Toyota van bearing the number plate WP HG 4846 There were five persons in the vehicle They were Shritharan his driver his Police bodyguard and two others The Policeman was a Sinhalese while the driver and the other two passengers were Tamils One of these passengers was a close relative of the MP who was to be dropped off at Vavuniya The other was a young undergraduate who was the son of a close supporter The youth was to accompany the MP to Colombo The van reached Vavuniya at about 330 pm After a brief stopover during which the relative took his leave the van resumed its journey with four occupants at about 4 pm The van was somewhere in the Medawachchiya region when a white van with unmarked number plates crossed them Within minutes the same vehicle did a U turn and changed direction The unnumbered white van overtook the MPs vehicle slowly and then sped away ahead Soon it was lost Although the antics of the white van attracted attention it did not cause too much concern Shritharans van that was going along the A9 highway or JaffnaKandy road changed course at Anuradhapura The vehicle now got on to the A12 highway or PuttalamTrincomalee road The stretch between Anuradhapura and Puttalam along the A12 is 7154 kilometres 4445 miles Ulukkulama Area The vehicle was travelling along the A12 in the Ulukkulama area of the Maha Bulankulama region when it negotiated a small bend on the road Further down was a pond A white van without number plates was parked by the roadside Two men in denim trousers and white tshirts were standing by the vehicle The time was about 530 pm As the van proceeded the two men in white drew out pistols and began firing at the front of the vehicle Two shots pierced the windscreen and entered but did not hit anyone Alarmed but alert the driver began to accelerate The attackers were now seen with a hand grenade each As the vehicle drew near one of the men pulled the clip and tossed it in front The other tried to roll the grenade under the van Thereafter they drew back and continued to fire at the van The driver who had been accelerating saw the grenades and veered to a side One of the grenades exploded without causing much damage to the vehicle One of the rear wheel tyres burst but it was not clear whether the grenade or the gunfire caused the damage Seeing that the rear wheel was damaged the assailants kept on firing at the back of the van A third person in denims and a black tshirt presumed to be the white van driver also joined the other two Policeman Fires The solitary Policeman in the vehicle had only a nine millimetre pistol The cop was seated by the side of the driver in the front He now tried to fire back at the trio through the side from within the vehicle It was difficult to aim accurately in this position and the first shot was an own goal hitting their vehicles rear screen The Policeman then asked the driver to stop Seeing the vehicle stop the three gunmen started running towards the van with their firing guns But the lone policeman bravely got down on the road and began firing at them The trio were unprepared for this and immediately ran back towards their van Altogether the cop had fired nine rounds The Policeman then got in and the van proceeded on the road despite the damaged rear wheel The van reportedly plodded along the road for a further 8 km But finally the tyre was totally deflated and the van was forced to stop somewhere in the Nochchiyagama area The time was about 6 pm The four people got down from the van and went to a house nearby Upon being told of the predicament the hospitable household invited the four inside As is customary among rural folk the Sinhala family showered them with hospitality serving them refreshments Nochchiyagama Meanwhile Shritharan had begun telephoning the Police while the van was going towards Nochchiyagama after the incident He informed Police Emergency and the Anuradhapura Police of the incident The Police bodyguard also informed his superiors of the incident Shritharan then tried to telephone fellow Jaffna district MP and the then ITAK Secretary Maavai Senathirajah but Senathirajah was at a meeting and had switched off his cellular phone Shritharan then called the then National List MP MA Sumanthiran in Colombo Upon hearing of the incident Sumanthiran also made a round of telephone calls to various Police circles He also called the Ministerial Security Division Despite these efforts the official response was rather lethargic Shritharan and the other three continued to remain at the Sinhala household in Nochchiyagama without any one from the Police coming there or contacting them MA Sumanthiran Disappointed by this lack of response MA Sumanthiran telephoned the then Inspector General of Police IGP Mahinda Balasuriya directly The IGP to his credit apologised for the delay by the Police in responding Within minutes the IGP got cracking and the Police machinery got into action Balasuriya got the telephone number of Shritharan from Sumanthiran and telephoned him personally The IGP told the MP not to worry and assured him of speedy Police action Within a short time a Police party from Nochchiyagama arrived at the house and escorted Shritharan and the others to the Nochchiyagama Police station The damaged vehicle was also towed there Shritharan lodged a formal complaint about the attack at the Nochchiyagama Police Station A police contingent also went to the spot where the attack took place and cordoned off the area A full scale probe was launched at daylight Several people in the vicinity were questioned and statements recorded Much evidence like shattered glass empty bullets grenade clip unexploded grenade etc were collected and photographs were taken In addition to these other pieces of evidence found in the vehicle were also collected A team from the Government Analysts Department went to Nochchiyagama and conducted an inspection The evidence collected was sent down to the Government Analysts Department in Colombo for further examination Statements were also recorded in detail from Shritharan the bodyguard driver and the undergraduate Fortunately none of them had any serious injury Finally the Police transported Shritharan and the rest in a Police vehicle to Colombo with increased Police escort They had been at the Nochchiyagama Police Station from 714 to 1130 pm Shritharan reached his official residence at Madiwela at about 230 am Chamal Rajapaksa Shritharan together with colleagues Senathirajah and Sumanthiran called on the then Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa at his chambers in the morning of March 8th before Parliament sittings commenced The Speaker was shocked to hear of the attack He promised the TNA of a fullfledged investigation into the incident He contacted the IGP immediately and asked him for a full report The IGP assured the speaker that he would provide a preliminary report on the following morning March 9th The Speaker then asked the TNA to be with him when the IGP presented the report Chamal Rajapaksa also allowed Sivagnanam Shritharan to raise a breach of privilege issue in Parliament Shritharan made a short statement explaining in brief what had occurred He also thanked his Police bodyguard and driver for their commendable action in safeguarding him Responding to Shritharan the Speaker assured full safety and security for all MPs He also told Parliament that a full investigation will be conducted into the incident and a comprehensive report would be presented to Parliament in due course IGP Mahinda Balasuriya When IGP Mahinda Balasuriya came with the preliminary report compiled by the Anuradhapura DIG of Police several Tamil Parliamentarians including Shritharan were also present at the Speakers chambers The IGP brought several photographs of the crime scene and the affected vehicle He also related the different lines of inquiry being followed by the Police The IGP then stated that two teams of Police sleuths were investigating the incident One was from the Anuradhapura district where the attack happened The other was a special team sent from Colombo Mahinda Balasuriya told Chamal Rajapaksa that a final report would be submitted in due course Uthayan Daily Apart from his statement in Parliament Sivagnanam Shritharan also made statements to various media organs about the attack In a statement made to the Uthayan daily Shritharan made an interesting observation In the news story appearing in the Uthayan Shritharan was quoted that the attack was a planned attempt to kill him and that his Tamil political opponents who were aligned with the government for concessions and ministerial posts were responsible EPDP leader and Cabinet Minister Douglas Devananda responded to Shritharans coded attack by alleging that the so called attack had never taken place Wimal Weerawansa also said the alleged incident was fabricated friction Responding to Weerawansa former ITAK Jaffna district MP Saravanabavan said that they had met the IGP earlier in the Speakers chambers where the Police chief had submitted a report with photographs about the incident Contrary to Weerawansa the IGP had confirmed clearly that there had been an attempt to kill Shritharan said Saravanabavan Fabrication There were also reports in some overseas Tamil websites insinuating that the attack on Shritharan was a fabrication It was alleged that the entire episode was a contrived drama and that there had been no real assassination attempt None of these accusations were substantiated with credible proof They were for the most part wild speculation tinged with venom against Shritharan However the fact remains that no one was arrested or charged over the incident The investigation petered out with the passage of time For some inexplicable reason Shritharan himself never pursued this firmly He never exerted pressure on successive governments to probe and bring to book those allegedly responsible Forgotten Chapter Shritharan also did not make much of the incident in the propaganda speeches he made during the elections of 2015 and 2020 The episode is almost like a forgotten or omitted chapter in the book about Shritharans life DBS Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyarajyahoocom"

        "body": "With the end of the war in 2009 the ITAK again gained its clout as the main Tamil party in the country as well as within the TNA Despite other Tamil parties in the north having grown as a threat to its hegemony in the north and the Tamil politics the ITAK is still a force to be reckoned with Many in the south seem to confuse the Tamil National Alliance TNA with the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi ITAK the group that can be considered to be the main Tamil political party in the country especially in the north This confusion was evident by the news items carried by some of the south based newspapers on the election of the Leader of the ITAK last Sunday January 21 Some Sinhala newspapers said that Sivagnanam Sritharan was elected as the Leader of the TNA while the others rightly described him to be the new President Leader of the ITAK The reason was very clear R Sampanthan MA Sumanthiran Mavai Senathirajah and Shanakiyan Rasamanickam who are familiar to the south have been the leaders of both the TNA and the ITAK for a long time Until 2014 Sampanthan headed both the parties and then Senathirajah was appointed the Leader of the ITAK Yet he did not make any impact in the south as the Leader of the ITAK With Senathirajah losing the Parliamentary seat in 2020 he was further eclipsed by Sumanthiran Rasamanickam and Sritharan and the ITAK also distanced itself from the limelight in the south The media always refer to these politicians as Leaders of the TNA though officially they represent the ITAK in Parliament Finally when Sritharan was elected as the President of the ITAK on Sunday some confused media channels in the south said that he was elected as the Leader of the TNA Although the TNA was initially formed as a fiveparty Tamil coalition in 2001 all constituent parties of it except for the ITAK have left it by now The last two parties the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation TELO and the Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam PLOTE left it in January last year Hence in a practical sense both the TNA and the ITAK have become an entity of two overlapping organizations now In other words the TNA is a one party alliance now despite Sampanthan being considered to be the Leader of the TNA while Sritharan has taken the mantle of the ITAK The ITAK is a party that has changed the political trajectory of Sri Lanka by officially introducing separatist politics in the country which later transformed into a three decades long bloody war between the armed forces and the Tamil armed groups claiming tens of thousands of lives However it functioned as an independent party only up to 1972 since its inception in 1949 From 1972 it has been the main constituent party of three coalitions Tamil United Front TUF from 1972 to 1976 Tamil United Liberation Front TULF from 1976 to 2001 and Tamil National Alliance TNA from 2001 to date Meanwhile the traditional Tamil parties including the ITAK were sidelined by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE and its violent campaign for a separate state These are the primary reasons for the present young generation of the south to mix the TNA up with the ITAK However with the end of the war in 2009 the ITAK again gained its clout as the main Tamil party in the country as well as within the TNA Despite other Tamil parties in the north having grown as a threat to its hegemony in the north and the Tamil politics the ITAK is still a force to be reckoned with The government as well as the representatives of the foreign governments and international institutions treats it as the chief representative of Sri Lankan Tamils Today it has a considerable say in determining the President and the ruling party of the country It is against this backdrop that one has to find the importance of the election of Sritharan as the leader of the ITAK at its special Central Committee meeting held in Trincomalee on Sunday Although three candidates initially vied for the leadership only two of them Srithran and MA Sumanthiran a politician well known in the south were finally left in the fray as former Batticaloa District Parliamentarian Seenithamby Yogeswaran withdrew his candidacy at the last minute in support of Sritharan Then Sritharan was elected President of the party at the first ever election for the leadership in the history of the party Sritharan obtained 184 votes and Sumanthiran had managed to get only 137 votes Both Sritharan and Yogeswaran have a more nationalistic approach towards the issues affecting the Tamil people than that of Sumanthiran Sumanthiran has considerable dealings with the south based political parties and local and international NGOs while Sritharan so far seemed to have an insular approach This nationalistic leaning in him might have helped Sritharan to have the edge over Sumanthiran at the election Confirming this inference former Chief Minister of the Northern Province CV Wigneswaran while congratulating the new Leader of the ITAK which nominated him as the Chief Ministerial candidate in 2013 stated that Tamil nationality has been safeguarded by the election of Sritharan and the party activists by their verdict have sent the message that the Tamil nationality should not be ruined With this statement it is not clear if Wigneswaran who served as a Supreme Court judge during the war meant any aspersion against Sumanthiran Sumanthiran has been targeted by the leaders of his own party in the past for his moderate approach towards the southern politics Sampanthan and Sumanthiran who have had hundreds if not thousands of rounds of discussions with the leaders of various south based parties are very well cognizant of the southern mindset and always attempted to reconcile with it while aligning with their party line as far as possible They have failed every time earning wrath from both the north and the south The best case in point was the solution to the ethnic problem proposed by the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly instituted in 2016 to draft a new Constitution In an attempt to strike a balance between the aversions to the terms unitary state and federal mode of governance by the north and the south respectively the Steering Committee with the consent of Sampanthan and Sumanthiran used the terms Ekiya Rajyaya in Sinhala and Orumiththa Nadu in Tamil in its proposals All hell broke loose with both the south and the north accusing the Yahapalana Government and the Tamil leaders of betraying the respective community During the same period Sumanthiran was taken to task in Jaffna for a statement he made in the south where he said that his party is not interested in the labels like federal state and unitary state He also landed in hot water for an alleged statement during an interview in Sinhala that he did not approve the armed struggle launched by the LTTE Every time Sumanthiran had to back down in the face of heavy nationalistic pressure On the other hand Sritharans mind has been shaped up by the environment he lived in during the war in Jaffna He had personally gone through that dark period having close dealings with the LTTE However one cannot expect a different future trajectory for the ITAK even if Sumanthiran had been elected President of the party owing to the heavy nationalistic pressure he would have to endure from the Tamil polity The political crisis faced by the Tamil community today was very clearly explained by a Tamil analyst in the Thinakkural newspaper two weeks ago He says that many in the Tamil community which has failed in formulating postwar political strategies are attempting to capitalize on the past Those who do not have such a past are being forced to imitate Although it would be futile to put forward a defeated party of the war in politics it is what many tend to do he had observed Against the backdrop of the frenzied veneration of the LTTE by the Tamil community there is little possibility for this view to be at least respected leave alone accepted However there is much food for thought in his remark on the postwar political strategies"

        "body": "Election fever is in the air Whether it be in the south with over 70 percent of the population or the Northern Province which is home to the largest minority elections are a hot topic In the south three political parties namely the National Peoples Power an alliance of individuals and organisation centred around the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP the Samagi Jana Balawegaya SJB and the United National Party UNP have named their candidates for the upcoming Presidential election Anura Kumara Dissanayake popularly known as AKD is the nominee of the NPPJVP combine The SJB nominee is Sajith Premadasa and President Ranil Wickremasinghe is the nominee of the UNP The Sri Lanka Freedom Party SLFP and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP have not put forward candidates of their own and are expected to support either the UNP or SJB candidate In the Northern Province the Tamil political groupings are divided as to whether they should boycott the elections or put forward a common candidate of their own The SJB though a new political party is largely seen as being part of corrupt political groupings which alternatively ruled the country since independence The JVPNPP the leftist nexus on the other hand has never been in power It is therefore not tarnished with the brush of corruption But the Wijeweeraled JVP was responsible for organising the armed insurrection of 1971 During that period the JVP described the Tamil tea plantation workers the only group of workers who could be described as the proletariat as an Indian fifthcolumn and called for their repatriation Their solutions to the food shortages facing the country at the time were childish Wijeweeras JVP spoke of uprooting the tea estates in the hill country and replanting the same with potatoes as the means to overcoming food shortages In a likely manner their armed insurrection was doomed to end in failure They attempted overthrowing state forces with locally manufactured guns galkatas and homemade hand bombs whilst facing a much larger well trained military armed with semi automatic weapons The organisation unfortunately learned no lessons from the failed up uprising which evolved into the barbaric uprising in 198889 The second uprising was brutal It paid scant heed to the value of human life or the teachings of Marx and Lenin whose political leanings the group purported to follow They also treated the masses as their serfs and brutally killed any who opposed them The organisation also made little effort to link up or recognise the problems of the northern Tamils referring to militant groups as Tamil terrorists The result death to large numbers of young men and women the brutalisation of society and the introduction of repressive legislation like the Prevention of Terrorism Act which remains in force even today Since those gruesome days the JVPNPP combine of today has come a long way The second JVP uprising launched in opposition to the setting up of the Provincial Council system has seemingly changed The present NPP leader in a June 2022 interview with the Daily Mirror said the Provincial Council system is now in the Constitutional system The PC system is a failed system of administration and it is a failure in the national crisis also But if those people believe that it is their right the PC system has to exist However in February 2023 JVP MP Handunnetti emphasised his party was not in agreement with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution He added the National Peoples Power NPP does not accept the Amendment to any extent adding that the JVP too is vehemently against the legislation Similarly the JVPNPP has been vacillating over its stance on the governments structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund IMF Presently surveys indicate the JVP nominee AKD as a frontrunner in the Presidential poll But if survey predictions are to be turned into votes the NPPJVP will need to stop changing its positions from time to time People have not forgotten the 2022 era of near anarchy They also remember with thankfulness the man who brought goods back to the shop shelves and calmed a near anarchic situation in the country They are unlikely to reject what they have in hand in place of an untested uncertain entity"

        "body": "Palestinians fleeing Khan Yunis on a donkey cart with their belongings as Israel pressed its blistering assault on the city yesterday AFP As Israels inhuman onslaught on the Gaza Strip continues the talk of a twostate solution is being bandied about by world leaders especially those from the Global South Though the twostate solution requires thorough scrutiny and resurrection some see this as an attempt to deflect global attention from the Gaza horror which has killed more than 25000 people 70 percent of them being women and children Whether this horror is gross genocide will be known today when the International Court of Justice delivers its provisional order Irrespective of the World Courts ruling Israel it appears has no intention to end its terror in occupied Palestinian territories as was evident two days ago in its heritage ministers reiteration that Gaza should be nuked Israels genocidal intention is also evident in its hardline Prime Minister Benjamins pointblank rejection of calls for a ceasefire Israels solution is war in which its adversaries are Palestinian children women the elderly and unarmed civilians with Hamas being the collateral damage Going by the Israeli leaders statements it appears that until there are no more Hamas members to die as collateral damage Israels war on children women and civilians will continue Sarcasm apart bringing the twostate solution from the back burner to the front may seem a little out of step given the ceaseless death and destruction in Gaza The immediate need is a ceasefire The twostate solution is for the day after But about the day after Israel and the rest of the world hold different views For Israel the day after will not dawn until Hamas is eliminated After more than 110 days of intense bombing that had no parallel in any other war theatre in modern history Israel has miserably failed to achieve the wars objective the elimination of Hamas and other resistance groups For the rest of the world minus Israels hardcore genocide cheerleaders such as the United States Britain and Germany the day after should follow an immediate ceasefire leading to talks that will eventually bring about a Palestinian state existing side by side with Israel in peace and harmony Such a day after was the call of the Global South when its leaders met in the Ugandan capital of Kampala for the NonAligned Movement and G77China summits last week Among them was Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe who has of late been more vocal about justice for Palestinians and a twostate solution Injecting a dose of practicality he set a fiveyear roadmap to navigate the obstacles and arrive at such an eventuality The presidents proposed fiveyear timeline brings back painful memories of the failed Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 The Oslo Accords outlined a plan to set up a Palestinian state within five years However the establishment of such a state based on the UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338which settled for the 1967 borders thus veering away from the 1947 UN General Assembly resolution 181could not be realised largely because Israel kept shifting the goalposts each time the Palestinian side met the Oslo deals conditions The last of such conditions was that Palestinians recognise Israel as a Jewish state a euphemism for a state exclusive to Jews Such recognition the Palestinians fear could give Israel a justification to expel its Arab citizensalmost 20 percent of Israels populationto the West Bank after stripping them of their Israeli citizenship The twostate solution is largely a charade that Israel with the backing of the US and some powerful European states used to mislead the world community into believing that it is ready to negotiate peace with Palestinians Israel also used it as a tool to divert the world communitys attention from its landgrabbing and settlementbuilding programmes in Palestinian territories Since the Oslo Accords Israels illegal settlementbuilding activities in the West Bank have more than doubled The US and Israels European allies would issue pro forma condemnation and would not take any serious measures to dissuade Israel from building these illegal settlements These illegal Jewish settlers have become a law unto themselves They kill Palestinians and when arrested they get discharged due to a lack of evidence or given a light punishment With the call for a twostate solution gathering some momentum Israel is faced with three choices 1 The twostate solution which the international community supports and is acceptable to the Palestinians 2 The onestate solution or a merger with Israel the Palestinians are willing to consider it provided that such a state is democratic and recognises the Palestinian refugees right to return 3 Continue its oppressive policy with genocide and apartheid laws until the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are cleansed of Palestinians Of these options Israel has chosen the third as has been evident in its genocidal action in occupied Palestinian territories Moreover for the twostate solution to be viable several obstacles need to be surmounted They include Zionism which dreams of establishing Eretz Israel or Greater Israel whose borders extend from the Nile in Egypt to the Euphrates in Iraq Another key obstacle is the support Israel receives from the United States As though it were under a spell Washington has been protecting Israel with military and economic assistance and the use of veto power to defeat antiIsraeli resolutions at the UN Security Council The mushrooming illegal settlements and the rise of Jewish extremism in Israeli politics are also peace killers The status of Jerusalem is another major challenge It is claimed by all three major Abrahamic religions Judaism Christianity and Islam Besides these religions propound conflicting eschatological narratives about Jerusalem The Jews expect the birth of a final messiah and the building of the fourth temple When this happens they believe the world will embrace Judaism The Christians await the second coming of Jesus Christ and when this happens the Jews and the rest of the world will embrace Christianity The Muslims also believe in the second coming of Christ who they say will give leadership to the Muslims defeat the antiChrist and urge people to join Islam Then there are other issues to be dealt with They include the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their villages from which they have been expelled the borders of the Palestinian state and last but not least the discord among Palestinian factions especially the rivalry between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas If President Wickremesinghe is serious about his twostate peace plan then he should back Chinas call for an international conference to explore a twostate solution President Xi Jinping has urged that the solution to the Palestine question be comprehensive just and sustainable Russia is backing Chinas call and has blamed the US for deliberately scuttling an earlier international effort through the quartet comprising the US the UN the European Union and Russia Unsurprisingly the US is not inclined to support a Chinaled international effort"

citizen of the country for a few more years because he has made essential goods in Sri Lanka freely available and also put a full stop to queues at fuel and gas stations But there are credibility issues with this government because this President hasnt yet got rid of many lawmakers who have had questionable track records Right now Sri Lanka is dependent on so many outside nations just to survive during the process of rebuilding its economy It is at a time of great uncertainty that other nations are so interested in our natural harbours Sri Lanka has been forced to cater to the interests of China and India on this matter which is connected to our geography But if you just turn the pages of time Singapore from virtually nothing has created for itself the worlds busiest port Its good if Sri Lanka can take a cue from Singapore as to how to become independent and be counted in a world full of highly ambitious nations In less than two weeks time Sri Lanka will celebrate its 76th National Independence Day giving its citizens enough memories to ponder on what kind of independence theyve enjoyed over the years To begin with we must ask ourselves the question whether we can afford to remain at home and relax on February 4th If not then we must take a quick look at the word independence and see whether we can relate to it Given the present situation in this island the word independence would mean something or more than that to people who have the ability to migrate of course in search of greener pastures Those who have decided to stay behind or cannot find the means and ways to leave this country will have to consider how fruitful February 4 should be spent especially if they are daily wage earners People right now dont enjoy the independence to voice their grievances against the authoritative regime thats in power Time and again we saw how civilians were arrested or dispersed when they gathered at public places and protested against this government First there will be resistance and then after some time the citizens of a country get used to the whip being cracked on them even if what there are demanding is well within the framework of democracy and fairness This regime promises growth in this country through this method of governance and gives a hint that Sri Lanka would one day akin to Singapore stand up on its feet The people of Singapore got used to the authoritative ways of governance by Lee KuanYew the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore who held office from 19591990 Now to be in power for 31 years is a long time But it served well because Yew delivered and turned Singapore from an underdeveloped country to a fully developed rich nation However in the process of Singapore making a turnaround its citizens were forced to experience hardships and also embrace discipline Yew always asked the question from potential foreign investors who stepped into the country and showed interest to invest in Singapore one initial question Whats there for Singapore if we get into a deal with you The equation was simple when Yew did business with the outside world Singapore was the subject of a business conversation and never the object At present political analysts are of the opinion that there is a school of thought that its better for the country to allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue as the first citizen of the country for a few more years because he has made essential goods in Sri Lanka freely available and also put a full stop to queues at fuel and gas stations But there are credibility issues with this government because this President hasnt yet got rid of many lawmakers who have had questionable track records Sri Lankans enjoy a freedom that doesnt serve the individual or the country We see people who are still lazy to work and are dependent on politicians and government aid It is in this backdrop that some citizens of this country are of the opinion that Wickremesinghe must continue in the hot seat of the President But then like Yew can Wickremesinghe put a full stop to corruption in politics and introduce legislation so that corrupt politicians can be arrested promptly Like Singapores renowned Prime Minister did the next President must bring in a system so that Ministers are paid well like in any other state sector job that demands professional qualifications this would then minimise corruption Not only the basic salaries all earnings of Sri Lankan Ministers must be subject to tax if this nations rulers continue to believe that a governments earnings must largely be generated through taxes Once this system is in order politicians can be paid large salaries but nothing should escape tax calculations We do remember the days when our first female Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike reformed this economy by imposing strict regulations If this writer remembers right in the 1960s there was a concept promoted by a certain business authority that a small family is worth gold But no politician had the guts to propose birth control because Sri Lanka is known to be a sensitive nation especially in relation to the use of business and political slogans Coming back to Yew he recommended a family planning concept under the slogan stop at two because he saw that if the countrys growing population was not checked it would have over burdened Singapores developing economy It would serve Sri Lanka well if our leaders take a cue from Yew on this issue that is connected to the countrys population Right now Sri Lanka is dependent on so many outside nations just to survive during the process of rebuilding its economy It is at a time of great uncertainty that other nations are so interested in our natural harbours Sri Lanka has been forced to cater to the interests of China and India on this matter which is connected to our geography But if you just turn the pages of time Singapore from virtually nothing has created for itself the worlds busiest port Its good if Sri Lanka can take a cue from Singapore as to how to become independent and be counted in a world full of highly ambitious nations"

Narammala Police Station opened fire at a civilian The civilian identified as K A Roshan Kumarasiri succumbed to injuries instantly The reason for this brutal encounter was the fact that the police officer who was in civilian clothes had signaled Kumarasiri to stop his lorry but since there was no sign to identify him as a police officer Kumarasiri had ignored the signalEyewitness accounts claim that the cop had chased after the lorry from Rammuthugala to Dampelessa He had then pulled it over for a spot inspection but eyewitness accounts claim that the subinspector had loaded his gun while going towards the lorry driver and subsequently opened fire We will take legal action Dharmasena Kumarasiri a father of three had been a carpenter by profession specialising in installing roofs On the day of the incident he was returning home after installing a roof in Katupotha said Mahesh Chinthaka Dharmasena who claims to be Kumarasiris best friend The Police say that it was mistake but that is not an excuse The irony of the situation is that even at the time of the incident it was two police officers from the Narammala Police station who were deployed to inspect the scene of crime Thereafter we heard that the two officers who were involved in the incident had been transferred and suspended from duties But that is not a solution to this matter said Dharmasena Following the incident area residents agitated in front of the Narammala Police Station The cop opened fire near a vegetable shop in Dampelessa In one video the owner of the Ambika vegetable shop who is also the main eyewitness of this incident blamed the cop for killing an individual The cop appeared to be in shock but was still waiving his pistol around He even attempts to flee the scene at onepoint Kumarasiris two daughters are twins and will be sitting for their OL exam this year His son is in grade two The wife is unemployed and Kumarasiri was the sole breadwinner of the family There were around 15 employees working with him Dharmasena added He said that providing compensation doesnt solve the problem His wallet is still missing We need to know why the police officer opened fire at him We need justice and we will take legal action said Dharmasena Police provides explanations Following the incident Acting IGP DeshabanduTennakoon ordered the launch of a special probe into the incident and issued a directive to the effect that policemen in civvies shouldnt be allowed to stop vehicles But the damage has already been done Thereafter the police provided Rs One million as compensation to the family of the victim Police Media Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that the police officer behaved recklessly and had not adhered to proper procedures while carrying out his duties A disciplinary inquiry too had been launched against the subinspector and constable who accompanied him The subinspector has been remanded till January 31 BASL calls for independent investigation In the wake of the incident The Bar Association of Sri Lanka issued a statement calling for an independent investigation on the recent surge of fatalities involving the police The BASL statement further said that the justice system provides a vital check and balance and should not be attacked for the sake of political pointscoring We vehemently denounce the use of divisive and deceptive rhetoric that undermines the rue of law and those dedicated to upholding it the statement read Police officers must be easily identifiable Satkunanathan The Police have been heavily criticised for alleged incidents of harassment while carrying out search operations under the Yukthiya programme Following the Kumarasiri Narammala incident people are worried about their own safety Speaking to the Daily Mirror Human Rights Lawyer and former commissioner of the Human Rights Commission Ambika Satkunanathan responds to a few salient questions regarding the conduct of the police Excerpts of the interview Q What are your observations regarding the conduct of the police as of late The police are supposed to provide protection to the public However not only in Sri Lanka but also in many other countries the police have become the predators They are supposed to arrest law breakers but instead the police break the law violate human rights and are never held accountable They also fail to take action to protect the public for instance it is quite common for women who try to lodge complaints about domestic violence to be turned away The police breaking the law undermines respect for the rule of law in general which makes society more insecure Q Can a cop in civil clothes stop a vehicle They should not because how would the public know it is a police officer and not a random civilian asking them to stop Police officers must be easily identifiable through uniform badge insignia etc Q What should the family or loved ones of a victim do in a similar situation Eg file a case at HRCSL or any other actions they could take They can file a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court but the verdict can take even years They can initiate civil action for compensation which can also take years But both options require them to retain lawyers which requires financial means They can also file a complaint with the HRCSL but the commission can only issue recommendations which the state authorities can ignore Subinspector captured on video following the incident"

        "body": "Hats off to the JVP lady who promised that when the JVPNPP comes to power it will legalize prostitution If Sri Lanka is to undergo the next phase of social revolution which the JVP promises the archaic and discriminatory laws should be discarded to build a system where every citizen irrespective of race religion income gender or sexual orientation could exercise the full scope of liberties But there is a glitch that the JVPs ideologues and their busloads of supporters fail to admit or they simply dont comprehend social liberalism cannot be achieved nor could it be sustained in the long run without economic liberalism A cursory look at international politics would reveal that where this was attempted at the exclusion of the latter from Cuba in the past to Venezuela as recently as a decade ago it ended up being a monumental disaster Therefore everyone who believes in the JVP promise to usher in a system change should ask the JVP leadership to reveal their economic strategy People conned by Gotabaya Rajapaksa who promised many things that the JVPNPP offers now though in a pungent ultranationalist flavour should take extra precautions when they hear promises that are too good to be true Unfortunately the JVP shows no inclination to offer any tangible economic policy agenda Thats a grave oversight considering Sri Lankas economic priorities and a simple promise of a system change could not wish away the countrys grave economic problems It has continuously opposed the IMF programme of economic stabilization Yet it offers no alternative Instead some of its stalwarts have hinted at the prospect of not paying up to the creditors of international sovereign bonds as if there would be no consequences that would be the easiest route to unravel the painstakingly achieved economic recovery so far The JVP thrives on public discontent with the government and its predecessors to come to power through a protest vote That is a dangerous gamble You can come to power through slogans but not govern a country You need an element of substance for that Since the JVP had not provided a detailed economic policy lets use some of the oftentalkedabout snippets on the JVP stage to deduce an idea about a generalized JVP economic policy Corruption Busting as a Panacea The JVP leaders have repeatedly said they would eradicate corruption as if growth would flow like water in a gutted pipe when the rod is removed But that is a dangerous oversimplification of the drivers of economic growth Firstly Sri Lanka has an enhanced sense of corruption perception rather than real corruption That results from the longterm function of how opinion makers politicians and NGO captains frame the discourse Secondly highlevel corruption in the country is born out of bureaucratic red tape permits restrictive legal regimes and monopolies of stateowned enterprises When excessive state control and interference hinder economic activity as some economists argue corruption serves as efficient grease that cuts down transactional costs for the investors though that could also dissuade many others from investing That is the case in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka can clamp down on corruption by dismantling this bureaucratic red tape liberalizing investment laws ending monopolies and reforming SOEs But one would doubt whether this is something the JVP would want to do even if it has the best intention of clamping down on corruption because its trade unions and its socialist ideology demand the continuation of this status quo of the overwhelming state control in the economy Last but not least if Sri Lanka is to rebrand itself it might also need proactive liable laws similar to Singapore to combat unsubstantiated politically motivated allegations which is not a question of free speech However ending corruption assuming it is materialized would not necessarily generate economic growth Interestingly many successful East Asian economies such as South Korea Japan Taiwan and even Malaysia under Mahathir were extremely corrupt during high growth decades Economic growth is facilitated by many drivers investmentfriendly policies low trade barriers reforms in land labour and capital laws a stable monetary regime and investment in human capital ExportDriven Economy Making Vietnam from Doing Nothing The JVP says it will turn the country into an exportdriven economy Everyone else says the same Since that would not happen by a miracle but only through government policy and investment fostering entrepreneurship and foreign investments in the absence of a detailed policy plan one should ask how Firstly lets take the recent remarks by Anura Kumara Dissanayake to export Graphene Though some make fun of his mixup of words Mr Dissanayake is alluding to a policy of promoting downstream industries instead of exporting raw materials However Sri Lanka is not necessarily a country with substantial raw materials that can stimulate economic growth Rather worryingly Dissanayake is implying a flawed policy in the past of indigenization and then to protect those underperforming local industries raise a wall around the country That is what Gotabaya Rajapaksa did through an export ban on building materials tiles and bathroom fittings which saw local wheelerdealers making a killing Secondly there is a misconception that it could pull off an economic miracle like Vietnam without doing anything Vietnam has two distinctive advantages its authoritarian which just like China exercises almost absolute control over the public and it has five times the Sri Lankan population Thirdly though economic liberalization is mandatory for the longterm economic survival of the country one should question whether Sri Lanka has longterm prospects by trying to jump into the missed train three to four decades after it left the station Lowend industrialization would have provided a longterm path to prosperity if JR Jayawardene succeeded in the 80s But it does not seem to work nor does it create decentpaying jobs A few years back the local garment industry struggled to fill in 50000 vacancies and lobbied to import workers from Bangladesh while the local lasses enmasse went to the Middle East to work as housemaids Instead of bottomfeeding industrialization Sri Lanka should try to jump into the middle Human Capital Cannibalizing it in the name of Free Education Sri Lankas greatest asset is its youth nearly twothirds of the cohort that sits for the GCE Advanced Level Examination now qualifies to enter university That is 167000 out of 262000 total applicants Instead of creating graduate and professional level education opportunities for them the Sri Lanka education policy is actively geared towards depriving their rightful chance The annual intake of around 40000 graduates into public universities paid by public funds comes at the expense of the rest of eligible peers The JVPaffiliated student unions are the most vocal in their opposition to privately funded higher education Medical students have forced private medical schools to be shut down If Sri Lanka is to have a real shot at prosperity it should provide higher education opportunities for all its children The government alone cannot do that in fact most staterun universities are the epitome of mediocracy Instead the government should proactively promote privatepublic partnership in education provide generous subsidies to attract worldclass universities to open campuses in the country and encourage the local private sector to open higher education and vocational training institutes Can the JVP do that Its ideological bed fellows would rather burn down the state than do this The Myth of Social Revolution in an Economic Straight Jacket Many students of international politics and policymakers believe that longterm economic growth gradually forces the states to dismantle oversized control The richer the country they become freer and more democratic Though some question the logic of this premise in relation to China under Xi Jinping China at present is a lot more socially liberal than it had been twenty years back A better example would be Taiwan which was under the grip of authoritarianism until the mid90s which were also its highgrowth decades that transformed it into a technological power house Today Taiwan is an oasis of political pluralism and the first Asian country to legalize samesex marriages Whereas system change without economic prosperity first peels off and then crumbles Finally leaving aside all the economic arguments are the JVPers worthy enough agents of social liberalism It is a party in which carders are banned from drinking alcohol Most of JVPs student activists in the universities double as moral policies

into the innovation frontier has its challenges The lack of extensive citation networks a shortfall in venture capital funding and skill mismatches represent the systemic constraints strangling the pipeline of creativity and opportunity Sri Lanka stares down these bottlenecks aware that overcoming them is a prelude to any genuine advancement in global standing In the heart of the Indian Ocean lies Sri Lanka a nation whose innovation engine is rapidly churning sparked by surges in Information Technology IT and Biotechnology a duo potent enough to redefine its economic story This country once overshadowed by the tigers of Asia is now on the brink of a remarkable transformation that may very well turn it into an innovation powerhouse The pivot to innovation is no longer a lofty ideal but an urgent necessity for Sri Lanka with statistics painting a stark contrast a mere 011 of GDP spent on RD in 2018 lagging the global average by over 2 But beneath these figures lies a treasure trove of potential fuelled by a nations resolve to excel If wellmined this potential could lead to a leap in GDP growth experts predict a possible 15 to 2 rise within a decade At the heart of Sri Lankas strategic metamorphosis are key strategies akin to cogs turning in a welloiled machine each vital to the nations upward mobility in the innovation race First the proposed National Innovation Fund and Innovation Enhancement Act vehicles designed to amplify RD investment and streamline regulations fostering an environment where innovation can breathe freely Equally pivotal is the educational overhaul to produce industryready talent a workforce naturally attuned to the nuances of groundbreaking technologies Initiatives resembling Hong Kongs Technology Leaders of Tomorrow program and Singapores crosssectoral strategies like Healthier SG may just offer the blueprint for inscribing success into the DNA of Sri Lankan innovation The undercurrents of change run deep with proposed intellectual property laws synchronized with global norms potentially vaulting Sri Lanka onto the world stage as a hub for innovation legality Furthermore the EcoIndustry Growth Grants could harvest the fertile crosspollination of sectors blending the richness of Sri Lankas biodiversity with biotechs precision and ITs agility Such bold measures can catalyze crosssector innovation much like Macrogens influence which echoes through South Koreas biotechnology success story A potent alchemy resides in the creation of global benchmarks and partnerships Imagine Sri Lanka entering a ResearchExchange Memoranda of Understanding akin to a tango between the nations inherent prowess and the cumulative wisdom from international counterparts Together they could engineer ecosystems fostering biodiverse research with the shared objective of global knowledge wealth However a leap into the innovation frontier has its challenges The lack of extensive citation networks a shortfall in

        "body": "Changing names of places and roads bearing the names of foreigners is common in countries that have gained independence from foreign rule Such changes can be easily justified in some cases where the foreign ruler was despotic but in others it may be a bit tricky as both personalities may have had significant contributions to their credit In most cases the personages displaced are driven into oblivion despite their contribution to society and erased from history The proposed changeover from Horton Place in Colombo 7 to Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha is justified given the yeoman service rendered by Arunachalam to Ceylon and the fact that he resided there But the change cannot take place without an acknowledgement of the contribution of Sir Robert Wilmot Horton to Ceylon Both Horton and Arunachalam contributed to Ceylons allround development each in his own way and as per the opportunities available in their time Sir Robert Wilmot Horton was Governor of Ceylon between 1831 and 1837 and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam was a polymath lawyer educationist public intellectual and political leader in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Both were at the forefront of Ceylons political and social development in their respective eras Sir Robert Wilmot Horton Educated in Eton and Oxford and with an interest in democracy Horton was posted as Governor to implement the 1833 Colebrooke Commissions report on constitutional reforms The report envisaged a Legislative Council of nine officials and six nonofficials The nonofficials were European merchants and native Ceylonese The nonofficials were nominated by the Governor The Legislative Council could only debate matters brought before it by the Governor It was a consultative body According to HAJ Hulugalle British Governors of Ceylon Colombo 1963 Horton was committed to democratization but he had difficulty choosing nonofficial members as in his view no native Ceylonese was fit to be in the Council The local British merchants showed no interest in joining the Council as there was no payment involved But Horton himself had a dim view of the merchants as they were no more than commission agents with no interest in improving matters in Ceylon No wonder then that when the Council met for the first time in 1834 there was not a single nonofficial They would join later due to his entreaties However Horton used the Legislative Council to the fullest abolishing forced labour and repealing the law forbidding Muslims and Chettiars a merchant class from Tamil Nadu from buying land in Colombo He also abolished the governments monopoly over cinnamon All these helped boost trade and economic activity The foundation of a judiciary was laid with the establishment of a Supreme Court and District Courts Trial by jury was introduced A Board of Education was set up in 1834 The Colombo Academy the forerunner of Royal College was set up in 1836 In the six years Horton was in Ceylon he built a number of roads thanks to good income from pearl fisheries Horton gave a boost to the local media He wrote for the Colombo Journal a governmentowned newspaper under various pen names Perhaps because of his acerbic comments in his articles the paper had to be closed in 1837 on the orders of the London authorities Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Like Horton Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam came from a privileged background After studies in Cambridge he joined the Ceylon Civil Service According to Speeches and Writings of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam edited by H Kumarasingham CPA Colombo 2019 Arunachalam won plaudits from The Times of London for conducting the census of 1901 The paper described him as the most comprehensive authority on the ethnology of Ceylon and of its varied people their history religions languages and literature In 1910 he brought out A Digest of the Civil Law of Ceylon which charted the rich and diverse legal traditions of the countryArunachalam was the prime mover of the Ceylon University Association formed in 1906 to create a university on the lines of Cambridge He also authored Sketches of Ceylon History which showed the multicivilizational splendour and significance of preEuropean Ceylon Arunachalam was radical even as a civil servant He published two articles in the Ceylon Observer in 1902 under the pseudonym Reform which strongly argued that Ceylon was ripe for selfgovernment when few would have even dreamt of it After retirement in 1913 Arunachalam plunged headlong into public service He became the first Ceylonese to be President of the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1916 He was especially interested in the ancient Great Chronicle The Mahavamsa Kumarasingham says Like his famous cousin Ananda Coomaraswamy he soaked in and savoured eastern art philosophy and literature However this and his eloquent attacks on colonial rule as practiced in Ceylon did not lead to callow denunciations of the West or what it represented Indeed as Robert Aldrich has argued despite his coruscating critiques of British imperialism and Western commercialisation he never rejected Europeans European cultures or the forms of democratic government that he witnessed in Britain Political Leadership Arunachalam was a fierce nationalist Ceylon is no pauper begging for alms She is claiming her heritage he asserted He was a driving force behind the formation of the Ceylon Reform League and Ceylon National Association and finally the Ceylon National Congress He followed the Indian National Congress to fashion a Ceylonese nationalism that promoted interethnic unity Kumarasingham reproduces a hard hitting speech by Arunachalam at the Ceylon National Congress on August 17 1920 in which he said that it was Ceylons misfortune that the Colonial Office was so illinformed of Ceylons needs and conditions and indifferent to its wishes He mocked Sir William Manning who was the Governor then saying that Manning belonged to the time before the Flood By temperament and training Manning was absolutely impervious to new ideas or to the spirit of the times He might make a passable Governor of a savage region in Africa but is quite out of place in Ceylon Arunachalam added in good measure The Ceylon National Congress under Arunachalams Presidency wanted the Colonial Office and Governor Manning to institute reforms on the pattern of the MontagueChelmsford reforms in India But Manning was stonewalling it For this Arunachalam blamed the Ceylonese too They were too divided for any meaningful action he pointed out There were multiple clashing interests Europeans Burghers Mohammedans Indians the Chamber of Commerce the Low Country Products Association all clamoured for representation and that competitively This way they played into the hands of the crafty Manning Arunachalam also regretted that the reform movement excited only the educated Like Gandhi in India he was for mass mobilization to achieve national ends He said Our feform propaganda too has scarcely touched the masses of the people though they are most vitally concerned The Lanka Mahajana Sabha and the Workers Federation the only bodies claiming to represent them have great possibilities but are hardly yet on their feet The movement has been mainly confined to the English Educated Classes and the workers are lamentably few Though these have worked with zeal and selfsacrifice beyond words they have been much hampered by the apathy of many professed reformers and lack of funds Some men of influence in our party have little trust in the masses of the people and regard them as only fit subjects for apparent despotism The Congress CNS itself has been obliged to whittle down its demands and to hedge them round with so many safeguards and checks as to imply that we had little confidence in ourselves and we could hardly expect the Colonial Office to have more confidence in us Governor Manning who was totally opposed to reforms encouraged the Kandyan Sinhalese to demand separate representation so that the Low Country Sinhalese would not dominate the Council Manning introduced a system by which if one were to stand for election from the Western Province one had to be a local resident This was a ploy to keep influential nonresident people out Later he substituted residential qualification by a property qualification Piqued by Mannings prevarication Arunachalam campaigned for an agitation and a boycott until Manning met the CNCs demands But there were virtually no takers for agitations in the CNC as terms like Home Rule and Swarajsmacked of an undesirable Indian influence When the CNCs Presidency went to Sir James Peiris a conservative agitations were rejected emphatically Before the 1921 Legislative Council elections Arunachalam had asked James Peiris to allocate the Colombo Town seat to him in accordance with an agreement reached during the formation of the CNC But Peiris turned down the request saying that acceptance would mean the acceptance of communal representation Arunachalam was distressed over the betrayal writes T Sabaratnam the veteran journalist The veteran Ceylonese leader announced his resignation from the CNC and then as a changed man formed a conservative Tamil party He died in Madurai in 1924"

drones do increase the risk to national security reflects a concern shared by many security experts and governments The capabilities of both state and nonstate actors in the realm of drone warfare can indeed pose challenges to national security and commercial drones play a significant role in this background A fleet of drones that are available online for as little as 6500 filled the skies above

the most technologically advanced powers in the world Bloomberg has revealed It wasnt the eruption of rocket fire from Gaza that rattled soldiers at Israels southern frontier on Oct 7 It was the

large UAVs but many Hamas drones are still able to slip through According to the New Yorkbased news website Therefore the hightech surveillance systems were not able to prevent Hamas military operation The Palestine Chronicle httpswwwpalestinechroniclecomhamasmakeshiftdronesareoutsmartingisraelstechnologybloomberg Evolutionary trends in pilotless aircraft need to be identified and put in context Instead of focusing on trends in the technical development of pilotless aircraft that is tracked through its various manifestations over time Since unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs are often included in the ongoing revolution in military affairs they are seen as a new concept created for the age of information warfare and netcentric operations Rather than being a new and revolutionary idea pilotless aircraft are a tried and true branch of military research and development Revolution in Military Affairs RMA is a hypothesis in military theory about the future of warfare often connected to technological and organizational recommendations for military reform Drones in warfare are primarily used for surveillance intelligence gathering propaganda and strikes Surveillance and reconnaissance are the most natural uses of drones All drones carry photo video or other data collection sensors which allow forces to locate enemy bases observe troop movements and choose targets Today the multifaceted nature of UAVs and the diverse ways in which they are employed by both state and nonstate actors Realtime intelligence gathering precision targeting and lethal capabilities contribute to the widespread adoption and interest in UAV technology Many countries continue to develop UAVs with multiple capabilities Developed products of various UAV capabilities are freely available in the market Now it is apparent that nonstate actors use of UAVs to spread fears could possibly be extended to chemical or biological attacks dangerously transporting illicit cargo with limited exposure or to cause any other desired reaction which will threaten national as well as regional security Countering the Drone Threat The continued growth of the consumer drone market presents new challenges for the aviation industry Whether its a careless amateur pilot or a deliberate attack the drone threat comes in many shapes sizes and forms Lets focus on whats currently available on the market So if you need to implement or are thinking about implementing a counterdrone solution then this is the resource for you Lets review the best counterdrone technology including a helpful breakdown of the pros and cons of each solution For ease of explanation it is split into two categories Monitoring equipment and countermeasures What is counterdrone technology Counterdrone technology encompasses a wide range of solutions that allow you to detect classify and mitigate drones and unmanned aerial vehicles This includes everything from camera systems and specialist drone detection radar to net guns and cyber takeover systems Drone Monitoring Equipment could be passive or active and can perform several functions including Detection Classification or Identification Locating and Tracking and Alerting It is important to be aware that not all equipment performs all the above functionality at the same time Detection means the technology can detect drones Detection alone usually isnt enough though A radar that detects drones may also detect birds for example Thats why classification is useful Technology that classifies drones will usually be able to separate drones from other types of objectslike planes trains and automobiles for example One step further is identification Some equipment can identify a particular model of drone or even identify the drones or controllers digital fingerprint This level of identification can be handy for prosecution purposes Being alerted that a drone is present somewhere in the vicinity is already useful But your situational awareness and ability to deploy countermeasures are greatly enhanced if you know the drones exact location Some equipment will even allow you to track the drones location in real time There are four main types of drone monitoring equipment Radio Frequency RF Analyzers Acoustic Sensors Microphones Optical Sensors and Radar State Actors such as the United States China and Russia have invested heavily in the development of sophisticated drone technology using Advanced Technology This includes unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs with advanced sensors long endurance and precision strike capabilities In the realm of drone warfare Stealth and Survivability are important factors Some state actors have developed stealth drones that are designed to operate in contested environments without being easily detected by enemy radar systems Swarm Technology is another aspect of the application exploring the use of drone swarms where multiple drones operate collaboratively to achieve a common objective Use of drone swarms Drone swarms are used in the military for reconnaissance missions surveillance operations and targeting enemy troops or installations serving as a deterrent in an armed conflict Nonstate actors use commercially available Drones that include terrorist groups and insurgent organizations and have been known to use drones for reconnaissance and surveillance purposes These drones are often repurposed for their needs Do It Yourself DIY Drones that are used by some nonstate actors have demonstrated the ability to build their own improvised drones for various purposes including carrying small payloads for attacks DIY drones are made out of local materials Nonstate actors typically have more Limited Range and Payload limited resources resulting in drones with shorter range and less sophisticated payloads compared to those used by major military powers CounterDrone Technology Many countries and organizations are investing in counterdrone technology to protect against the threat of malicious drone use This includes systems for detection tracking and mitigation Also adversaries employ electronic warfare techniques to disrupt or disable drones This involves jamming communications or even hacking into the drones control systems Further countries are developing and implementing legal frameworks to regulate the use of drones especially in sensitive areas This includes nofly zones registration requirements and other measures to prevent unauthorized drone activity Its essential to stay updated on the latest developments in drone technology as this field is rapidly evolving and new capabilities are regularly introduced Additionally the ethical and legal implications of drone warfare continue to be subjects of international debate and consideration Drones in Ukraine and beyond Everything you need to know The Ukrainian battlespace features the most intensive use of drones in a military conflict in history marking a shift in warfare tactics and technology Drones have been around for a long time a very long time if you go back to Chinese fire kites or the Austrian attack on Venice using exploding balloons in 1849 In addition Drones were used in Vietnam in the Kosovo war Afghanistan Iraq and most recently in the confrontation between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno Karabakh The ongoing war in Ukraine is thus not the first drone war It is neither the first war in which drones play an important role nor the first in which both sides employ them Nevertheless the use of drones in Ukraine represents a step change Never before have so many drones been used in a military confrontation The Royal United Services Institute estimates that Ukraine is losing 10000 drones per month giving an indication of how many are in use Aerial Defence systems are largely neutralizing manned aviation making unmanned systems particularly important For those looking to understand their importance here are the main takeaways from Ukraine There have been different drone systems in use in Ukraine These range from the very small such as the Black Hornet which has a wingspan of only 12 centimeters to drones with wingspans of over 15 metres Small systems play a particularly important role in Ukraine Quadcopters and other rotor drones are mainly produced by commercial firms such as the Chinese DJI and are among the most common Armed systems such as the Turkishmade Bayraktar TB2 or on the Russian side the Orion drone carry missiles which can be used to attack troops on the ground Socalled kamikaze drones or loitering munition singleuse drones which hover above a target before diving into it and exploding with it are also used extensively especially by Russia but more recently for the attacks on Moscow Kremlin Attack On 3 May 2023 amidst the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine two explosive drones allegedly targeted the Kremlin in Moscow and were shot down The Kremlin accused Ukraine of perpetrating the incident and called it an act of terrorism and an assassination attempt Ukrainian officials denied involvement while US officials said it was likely that a Ukrainian intelligence or special military unit was behind the attack httpsenwikipediaorgwikiKremlindroneattacktextOn20320May2020232C20amidstMoscow20and20were20shot20down Surveillance and reconnaissance are the most natural uses of drones All drones carry photo video or other data collection sensors which allow forces to locate enemy bases observe troop movements and choose targets Closely linked to surveillance is the ability of drones to document attacks which can also provide useful material for propaganda purposes Drones have documented the destruction of cities by Russian forces the flooding of Ukrainian territory following the Kakhovka dam breach and attacks against Russian ships tanks troops and materiel Finally drones are used to help direct and conduct strikes At the beginning of the war Ukrainian forces used armed military drones such as the TB2 to target the Russian convoy headed for Kyiv A TB2 drone may also have been used to distract the defences of the Russian flagship Moskva while naval missiles attacked and ultimately sank it Intelligence gathered by drones is also used to direct artillery and other strikes Many possibly the majority of the drones used by Ukrainian forces were originally designed for commercial purposes or for hobbyists Drone attacks on Moscow are a warning signal for now but could eventually have military consequences Initially unmanned systems were used to attack military installations in Russia such as the Engels air bases in December More recently there have been drone attacks on Moscow including its financial centerwhich could have been carried out either by the Ukrainian armed forces or proUkrainian groups possibly from within Russia Militarily their impact has been limited so far no one has been killed in the attacks and the destruction appears minimal But a signal has been sent to the Russian regime population and businesses that the war could come back to Russia While Russian air defences reportedly intercepted some of the drones it is still embarrassing for the Russian military that they are unable to protect the capital If the attacks continue and grow in frequency and force the Russian army may have to increase the protection of Moscow and other cities meaning aerial defence systems or experts might have to be withdrawn from the frontline Naval drones are beginning to play a role in Ukraine The term drone doesnt necessarily refer to airborne systems but most drones fly Maritime drones both surface vessels and submarine systems exist as well as groundbased drones though it is also called robots rather than drones Before this conflict however only airborne systems were used extensively in military operations This is starting to change Drone boats were already used recently most notably in the attack on Russias Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol More recently Ukrainian forces damaged a Russian amphibious landing ship and struck a Russian fuel tanker using naval drones These attacks are a testimony to Ukraines innovative militaryindustrial sector Ukraine is likely to become a serious player in the drone industry once the war ends Ukraine has become an important place for drone development and manufacturing Joint privatepublic partnerships have led to the development or repurposing of drones for military use The pressure of the war to innovate the ingenuity of the Ukrainian people and the opportunity to work closely with experts from many Western countries have helped establish a robust domestic defence industrial base The Ukrainian drone industry is on track to become a serious international player once the war ends able to export systems that are combatproven The Ukrainian battlespace features the most intensive use of drones in a military conflict in history marking a shift in warfare tactics and technology To address these concerns many countries are working on implementing or enhancing regulations related to drone usage including registration requirements nofly zones and the development of counterdrone technologies Additionally there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation to establish norms and standards for responsible drone use to mitigate potential security threats Drones are easy targets but that doesnt mean they are easy to fight Drones are easy targets as they are usually not built to evade aerial defences They tend to fly low and slowly and can often be destroyed with a single hit The key is to integrate security practices into the development lifecycle and maintain a proactive stance towards addressing potential riskschallenges It is important to understand that the landscape of the realm of Drone warfare is dynamic technological regulatory and market changes are ongoing However combatting drones can be difficult as one needs to have the right drone defense systems in the right place at the right time while not spending significantly more money on fighting a drone than the drone is worth There are two main ways to down a drone kinetically and electronically The first means shooting down a drone with bullets rockets or similar The second means jamming or interrupting the signal between the drone and its operator A more advanced version of this approach is to hack the drone and take over its command The counterdrone market is a multibillion business opportunity Drone Countermeasure Equipment In general Countermeasures can be grouped as either Physically destroying the drone Neutralizing the drone and Taking control of the drone Its important to note that although the technology is available current regulations in most countries forbid the use of any of the technologies to neutralize drones Exceptions are sometimes made for military or law enforcement agencies GPS spoofing GPS spoofing is when a counterfeit radio signal is transmitted to a receiver antenna to counteract and override a legitimate GPS satellite signal It is often a form of cyberattack perpetrated by bad actors attempting to steer goods or people off course By dynamically altering the GPS coordinates in real time the spoofer can control the drones position Once the spoofer gains control they can direct the drone to a safe zone However there is a risk of GPS spoofers inadvertently disrupting other systems beyond the target drone Because of the risks GPS spoofers are primarily used on the battlefield and arent as common for civilian operations Essential Balance Nations need to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the drone industry and ensuring robust security measures to prevent misuse Ongoing research and development in counterdrone technologies are also crucial for maintaining national security in the face of evolving threats that is apparently seen in the two ongoing conflicts in Europe and Gaza On 17 January 2024 the Iranian backed Houthi movement attacked the Marshall Islandsflagged United Statesowned and operated bulk carrier Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden According to the United States military a oneway suicide unmanned aircraft system struck the Genco Picardy at approximately 830 pm Sanaa time The attack on the Genco Picardy represented the second in recent days targeting vessels directly linked to America after USled strikes targeting the Houthis It also underlined the risks to shipping in the vital waterway amid Israels war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip The Genco Picardy sustained damage but remained seaworthy and was able to continue its journey The trajectory of drone technology points towards a future characterized by transformative advancements in various sectors including logistics agriculture infrastructure public safety and environmental monitoring As drones continue to evolve they are poised to reshape industries offering innovative solutions to longstanding challenges and unlocking new possibilities for efficiency precision and datadriven decisionmaking Autonomous capabilities swarming technology and improved artificial intelligence are expected to play pivotal roles in expanding the scope and applications of drones while ongoing efforts in regulation and safety will be crucial in fostering responsible integration into our daily lives The use of drones is no longer limited to the military sector Nowadays drones are being widely used in other key applications of Entertainment Law Enforcement Wildlife Monitoring Weather Forecast Agriculture Disaster Management Geographic Mapping Delivery and Shipping The increase in the use of drones by several end use industries for operational use is anticipated to be the major driving factor for the global UAV drone market growth from 20192027 The author has exercised utmost effort to incorporate opensource information in this conversation ensuring that security is not compromised The key is to integrate security practices into the development lifecycle and maintain a proactive stance towards addressing potential riskschallenges It is important to understand that the landscape of the realm of Drone

        "body": "Many hailed the recent Supreme Court ruling on the case against the granting of Presidential pardon to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been convicted for the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8 2011 calling it a landmark judgement However their stand on the mater does not seem to be so different than the decision by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to grant the pardon to Silva Both were politically driven The irony of the decision by former President Rajapaksa was that at the time of the murder both Silva and Premachandra were working closely with him one as a monitoring MP for the Defence Ministry to which Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Secretary and the other as the Advisor to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on trade union affairs However the family of Premachandra distanced themselves from the government alleging that the government of the day was siding with Silva during the investigations The Supreme Court ruling on the decision by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to grant pardon to Silva was based on technicalities and not on politics or other reasons that prompted the former President in granting clemency In fact the significance of the judgement would have been far reaching and deterrent on future unethical clemencies had the prosecution challenged the motive of the former President Why a Head of State should grant pardon to a person convicted by a court of law in the first place is the most important question one has to pose It could be acceptable if the convict is languishing in prison for not being affordable to appeal against the verdict of a lower court or if there is a general perception that there has been a miscarriage of justice as a result of political or personal vendetta by the Executive There were no protests when the former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka and former Chief Justice Dr Shirani Bandaranayake were exonerated by former President Maithripala Sirisena since the miscarriage of justice was clear and the whole country knew that they were victims of Presidential highhandedness Even Dallas Alahapperuma a bigwig of the Mahinda Rajapaksa government hailed the decision by President Sirisena to promote Fonseka to the rank of Field Martial However almost all recent amnesties granted by Presidents to the convicts of high profile cases have been controversial and all of them had been politically motivated and highly unfair by the victims of the relevant cases The pardoning of Mary Juliet Monica Fernando the wife of a former Minister who was sentenced to death for a double murder in 2005 by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in March 2009 was the first best example for undermining the role of the judiciary by way of Presidential clemency in the recent past In May 2019 former President Maithripala Sirisena similarly pardoned Secretary General of the Bodu Bala Sena Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera who was serving a sixyear prison sentence for Contempt of Court The second controversial pardon by former President Sirisena was granted on 9 November 2019 to Don Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha who was sentenced to death in the Royal Park Murder case Later former President Sirisena had said that an investigation has revealed that some individual had taken money to ensure that a Presidential pardon was granted to Jayamaha On 26 March 2020 former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa granted a Presidential pardon to former Lance Corporal Sunil Ratnayake a prisoner on death row for the murder of eight innocent persons in Mirusuvil in 2000 Then Duminda Silva was released on June 24 along with some others who were also pardoned by the former President All these Presidential actions were controversial and clear to be unethical Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa not only pardoned convicted criminals but also appointed a commission to overturn a whole lot of court rulings in the guise of rectifying political victimization Yet public opinion prevented it from happening Overturning judicial decisions by the Executive must be carried out on strong legal as well as ethical grounds without sending wrong messages to the criminals It seems to be that the current mechanism can be abused by the Executive to reverse court rulings and release criminals Hence the Parliament must take action to introduce a strong foolproof mechanism in this regard"

recruited a lot of Ceylon Tamils to the public service recognising their skill merit and performance not only in Ceylon but also in India Malaysia and Singapore as well All these significant trailblazers of CeylonSri Lanka hail from the Tamil community based on available information which was a result of the greater education given by British rulers in Ceylon In simple encapsulation Tamils were well treated by the British colonial rulers The Plight of Tamils in the PostIndependence Phantasmagoria While recollecting the period of British rulers in Ceylon where Tamils were flamboyantly jubilant in the postindependence period they were jinxed There were no dearths of discrimination deaths and destructions against minority Tamils In 1948 Indianorigin Tamils were denied of their citizenship and made stateless their franchisevoting rights were stripped off In 1956 the Sinhala Only Act was enacted making Sinhala as the official language which became a stumbling block for Tamil government servants to continue their state services if they did not qualify in Sinhala In 1970 the policy of standardization was introduced for university admissions therefore many Tamilmedium students with higher scores were deprived of their university admission while Sinhala medium students were given university admission with lower scores Ultimately this was the immediate root cause of an arms struggle for a separate state by the Tamil youths The policy of standardization had cast a shadow over the Tamil students who were aweinspiring in their studies In 1972 the minority rights safeguard Section 292 enshrined in the Soulbury Constitution was disemboweled and Buddhism was given the first and foremost place whereby other religions have been undermined in a multireligious Ceylon The culture of antiTamil racial riots continued in the years of 1956 1958 1977 1981 and 1983 popularly known as Black July against the Tamils by the Sinhalese mobs with the support of the then government in which many Tamils were killed injured burned alive including a Brahmin priest and lost their property enormously This Black July was the reflection of the Tamil Tigers killing thirteen Sinhalese forces in Jaffna In an Interview to the Daily Telegraph on 11th July 1983 before the fortnight of 1983 riots former President JR Jayewardene said I am not worried about the opinions of the Jaffna Tamil people now Now we cannot think of them Not about their lives or of their opinion about us The more you put pressure in the north the happier the Sinhala people will be herereally if I starve the Tamils Sinhala People will be happier In 1974 the Fourth World Tamil Research Conference was held in Jaffna which was interrupted by the government and the police shot and killed nine innocent civilians The festive and enthusiastic environment suddenly sprung to be all hell broke loose In 1981 the Jaffna library which was one of the best libraries and the cynosure of all eyes in South Asia was set ablaze by the statesponsored Sinhalese hooligans from the South Over 96000 volumes of books along with numerous culturally important and irreplaceable manuscripts were burned into oblivion During the thirtyyear civil war in the northern and eastern provinces where Tamils live aerial bombing attacks were carried out by the Air Force indiscriminately on churches Hindu temples hospitals and schools security checkpoints from place to place were installed the governments indefinite curfew was enforced from time to time in the years 19871993 and an economic embargo was imposed The people were internally displaced from their own dwellings and still living in temporary shelters as refugees Many thousands of Tamil civilians were allegedly killed by the attacks of security forces and the worstcase scenario was that a Tamil schoolgirl and women were allegedly raped and killed by security forces The case in point was a student of the distinguished Chundikuli Girls College Krishanti Kumaraswamy who was raped and killed in a cruel manner in Jaffna in 1996 She got through her OLevels with flying colours obtaining seven distinctions Meanwhile many Sinhalese civilians were also targeted and killed by separatist Tamil Tigers And Sinhalese people were also displaced from their own villages to save their lives owing to threats from the Tamil Tigers Over 6000 acres of residential and agricultural land belonging to Tamils were grabbed by security forces and kept at the clutches of the military for over twentyfive years under the scheme of the High Security Zone in the Northern Province A plethora of Tamil youths had been arrested and incarcerated for years some detainees had no end in sight even without trial under custody And the prisoners who were held incommunicado with their family members had only slim chances Even as of now the family members and relatives of those enforced disappearances live excruciatingly in pain without information as to what happened to their loved ones So many widows by war were forced to be lone breadwinners for their children under squalid conditions There were statesponsored settlements of Sinhalese in the regions where Tamils lived traditionally and historically in native regions with the purpose of changing demography content There have been instances where people have been denied emancipation and restricted by Police and security forces from commemorating their family members and loved ones who died in the civil war In the vortex of the civil war and conflagration a large number of Sri Lankan Tamils fled abroad Sri Lankan Tamils have become a ubiquitous race in Western nations All these sad tragedies have been engraved in the hearts and minds of Tamil people"

        "body": "Followers of wholesome Dhamma need not be disturbed by individuals like Jeromes Sepalas Natashas Ruwans or Avalokiteshvaras these are insignificant outside influences a phenomenon that existed even in the times of the Buddha The growing concern lies in the emerging threat posed by Devadattas operating within the Sasana Isms can be unwarranted whether they take the form of theism atheism vegetarianism Buddhism or any other philosophical stance When a belief transforms into an ism it tends to integrate into ones identity Its not just a matter of refraining from consuming meat it evolves into being a vegetarian defining a person beyond mere conviction This shift implies that the belief becomes intrinsic to ones sense of self Humans display a peculiar relationship with their identities Holding a belief typically involves minimal emotional baggage Individuals may defend the belief when it seems reasonable and discard it when confronted with sufficient contrary evidence Adopting a believers identity or becoming an ist introduces a different dynamic The belief metamorphoses into something that individuals vehemently defend akin to protecting a vital part of their body under attack This level of attachment often leads to a passionate defence of the ism regardless of the rationale or evidence presented Bodhisatva Avalokiteshvara a Mahayana concept also known as Guanyin in Chinese embodies compassion and emerged as a pivotal deity in Buddhism around the sixth century As per Theravda Buddhism a bodhisatva is someone who has resolved to become a Buddha and has received confirmation or prediction from a living Buddha In Sri Lanka a wave of religious figures claiming miraculous powers have gained followers possibly fuelled by the prevailing poverty and deep despair over the behaviour of persons in authority in relation to the religions When the news broke out two others who had attended the mans funeral also committed suicide The leader Ruwan Gunaratne who asserted achieving a state of sovan preaches about managing death He emphasizes the unpredictability of death and the importance of planning ones last moments for a better future life Was it a misinterpretation of wishful parinibbana Throughout the history of India suicide for broadly religious motives has been a common phenomenon embraced by individuals across age social status and gender Notably within ascetic traditions suicide has been regarded as a fitting and in some cases the most exceptional means of concluding ones earthly existence Individuals may defend the belief when it seems reasonable and discard it when confronted with sufficient contrary evidence Adopting a believers identity or becoming an ist introduces a different dynamic The belief metamorphoses into something that individuals vehemently defend This level of attachment often leads to a passionate defence of the ism regardless of the rationale or evidence presented In a paper from 1983 Martin Wiltshire discussed the significance of suicide in Buddhist ethics and doctrine focusing on its impact on autonomy the value of human life and topics like physicianassisted suicide and euthanasia Western scholars influenced by these ideas debated whether suicide is allowed for enlightened individuals Some argued that its justified for the enlightened saying that the key difference is the absence of desire These views have influenced Western scholarship for the past seventy years Recently some scholars ignoring textual evidence claimed that the Buddha praised the suicides of Arhants Vakkali and Channa advocating for a consistent Buddhist position supporting suicide parinibbana The Ruwan Philosophy could be a gross misunderstanding of the above The intricate web of religious truths myths and the fine line between reality and deception is a challenging endeavour The human tendency to react emotionally often by shooting the messenger poses an additional layer of complexity In the face of disrespectful expressions aimed at causing offense or harm it becomes essential to transcend personal emotions and discern the obscured message within Rather than succumbing to anger a more constructive approach involves allowing authorities to identify any potential violations of the law which also unveils any hidden agendas that may be concealed within The language used in Nathashas script might be unsettling and cause irritation However beneath this lies an unintended but thoughtprovoking message encouraging us to Detach Dhamma from Fiction and Isms Kalamas when you find yourselves in doubt its natural for uncertainty to arise So Kalamas dont just rely on hearsay legends traditions scriptures logical guesswork inference analogies agreement through pondering views probability or simply because someone is considered your teacher Challenge and question even the most fundamental beliefs and convictions including those related to the Dhamma itself Cultivate a spirit of inquiry and critical assessment with an unprejudiced mind Prejudice passion fear of expressing ones convictions and ignorance are the four biases that must be relinquished at the threshold Encouraging the spirit of inquiry means fostering a mindset that seeks to understand deeply rather than accepting things at face value It invites individuals to challenge their own beliefs even those related to the teachings of the Dhamma By embracing this approach one can develop a more profound and authentic understanding of truth free from blind adherence to preconceived notions or external authority The essence lies in cultivating a discerning mind and being open to questioning and exploration in the pursuit of genuine wisdom and insight Unless we revise or eliminate outdated divine manifestations especially fictionalized sections in the biography of Buddha that might inspire future individuals like Nathasha to stage comedic performances we risk all of us being portrayed as Fools with Pride Buddhists are acquainted with the Buddhas biography which seems to have developed or evolved over time mostly compiled by commentators observers and critics The shift toward a more secular society in Europe is apparent in recent research revealing that a majority of young people in twelve countries do not align with any religious beliefs In the UK a relatively small percentage of young adults identify with specific religious denominations reflecting a broader trend away from traditional religious affiliations Reference Report titled Europes Young Adults and Religion authored by Stephen Bullivant a Professor of Theology and the Sociology of Religion at St Marys University in London Research by Professor Singleton and Dr Halafoff shows that Australian teenagers leading the way in religious change differ from older generations in their beliefs and affiliations The study reveals that a majority of teens 58 never attend worship services signalling a decline in traditional denominations Separateness leads to disintegration The enclosing force of strong beliefs whether as Buddhists Hindus Muslims Christians Theosophists or any other label creates opposition and antagonism Ideas and philosophies despite their cleverness idealism and amusement contribute to this division Like an addiction people cling to their beliefs leading to a decline in organized religions worldwide especially among the youth Unless we address and rectify the issues within the Sasana and Buddhism the youth here may follow similar trends observed in other countries Another contradictory factor that challenges young minds is the Foremost position entrenched in the Constitution despite Buddhas emphasis on equality It is crucial to extend beyond countering new cults and include addressing concerns related to saffron robe clad monk businessmen some with questionable ethics and others involved in constructing luxurious abodes These practices are inflicting considerable harm on the Sasana necessitating immediate action to safeguard the integrity and sanctity of Buddhist teachings Dhamma Only through such intervention can they effectively thwart outside influence and protect not just Buddhism but the essence of the Dhamma kksperera1gmailcom"

        "body": "Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan in an interview with Daily Mirror discusses the current status of bilateral ties and what is being planned for the future Excerpts Q How did the recent visit of a top level Russian delegation help elevate bilateral ties We are satisfied with the current level of our bilateral relations Another indication of it was the visit of a highranking Russian delegation It was a rather big delegation of more than 40 people headed by Nikolai Patrushev the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation He had a very important meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on December 6 2023 He had a meeting with Defence Secretary Major General Rtd Kamal Gunaratne The latter was in Moscow in May last year So its a continuation of bilateral dialogue Also Mr Patrushev when he was in Colombo last December extended his invitation to Mr Gunaratne to visit Russia in the coming year There were meetings with the representatives of our Ministries the Minister of the Interior the Minister of Security Affairs and some other bodies A separate meeting was held between the representatives of the Russian Ministries of Agriculture Transportation Industry Central Bank and their counterparts under the auspices of the RussiaSri Lanka Business Council We are satisfied We have discussed some issues and made some proposals from both sides The continuation of this dialogue will take place in April Q The defence cooperation is sought in a special context when the RussiaUkraine war is going on and a crisis situation is seen in the West Asian region So what kind of defence cooperation does Russia expect to maintain with Sri Lanka in that context First of all I would like to say its not RussiaUkraine war in our understanding Its a special military operation which Russia started Its war between Russia and the collective West in the Ukrainian territory The western countries would like to inflict a defeat to Russia a strategic defeat But we will defeat the puppet regime in Ukraine and their foreign sponsors Regarding defence cooperation mainly we are talking about education for Sri Lankans Q Education means Yes lets say for military We are discussing education for students not only civilians but for military too We have already declared our readiness to set up a small nuclear power station either offshore or onshore it maybe 110 megawatts or more the technical aspects will be decided by the specialists However it is Sri Lankas sovereign decision as only the Sri Lankan government can decide whether they want to cooperate with Russia or with other countries We dont exert any pressure We only try to convince We have very good cooperation with your neighbours first of all with India and Bangladesh Q Actually from a defence perspective how do you view Sri Lankas strategic positioning Of course the strategic positioning of Sri Lanka is very important And we highly appreciate your balanced and neutral position also regarding Ukraine Despite pressure which is exerted on you from the West we expect your government to preserve this neutral position It is very important for Sri Lanka to have good relations with both the West and the East Q During the war we used to purchase a lot of military equipment from Russia What about the situation now It was from Russia and also from the former Soviet Union We are open to discuss everything You have military cooperation with Western countries India and China So why not with Russia Q What are the followup actions taken after that highlevel visit We expect some other visits We are now working on the prospects of political consultations at different levels Maybe some delegations will come For example the Minister of Agriculture got an invitation to come here in February So Sri Lankas Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera sent his Russian counterpart Mr Dmitry Patrushev the invitation to participate in the international conference held under UN auspices In the agriculture sector the potential areas for cooperation are primarily fertilizers and the supply of food We are ready to supply wheat to Sri Lanka and some other items By the way two of our ships carrying vegetable oil have already arrived at the Port of Colombo That is a humanitarian aid to the friendly people of Sri Lanka It is part of the Russian contribution to the World Food Programme to provide Sri Lanka and other countries with food Q In the agriculture sector what are the potential areas for cooperation First of all fertilizers Also the supply of food We are ready to supply wheat to Sri Lanka and some other items By the way two of our ships carrying vegetable oil have already arrived at the Port of Colombo That is a humanitarian aid to the friendly people of Sri Lanka I participated in the ceremony of handing over similar humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka in September last year It is part of the Russian contribution to the World Food Programme to provide Sri Lanka and other countries with food Q RussiaSri Lanka cooperation is going on well as far as tourism is concerned These days Sri Lanka receives a lot of tourists from Russia Actually in what ways can Russia help increase the number There is no need for special propaganda because Sri Lanka is a wellknown destination for Russians They are very happy when they come here We expect to mark in February 200000 arrivals by direct flights from Russia since they were resumed We have many direct flights per week from Moscow and from other Russian cities both to Colombo and Mattala A lot of Russians are coming via Arab or Gulf countries too It is a big contribution to your economy They spend money here It is also very important for your budget and for the employment of people engaged in tourism Q During the toplevel meeting Chairman of Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Authority Prof SRD Rosa made a briefing on Sri Lankas position regarding nuclear energy How far have you progressed in this regard First of all I would like to use this opportunity to express once again my personal respect to Prof Rosa and his staff members for their collaboration and their readiness to cooperate with Russia There are some issues to be settled in Sri Lanka I mean legislation that is to be settled We are trying together to pave the way for a continuation of negotiations as we are aware that Sri Lanka has got some proposals from other countries We are ready to offer something It is important to create necessary conditions for the Russian delegation from the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation to come here They can discuss the issues of mutual interest Im not authorized to discuss the details We have already declared our readiness to set up a small nuclear power station either offshore or onshore It maybe 110 megawatts or more I dont know technically Its up to the specialists It is your sovereign decision Only the Sri Lankan government can decide whether they want to cooperate with Russia or with other countries We dont exert any pressure We only try to convince Rosatom is a world leader in terms of the construction of nuclear power plants We have very good cooperation with your neighbours first of all with India and Bangladesh We started our cooperation very practically With Myanmar we have very good cooperation We have cooperation with Belarus Hungary Egypt Turkey and Iran So we are the leaders Q What kind of cooperation do you expect Is it a kind of a model similar to what you do in Bangladesh and India Its up to the negotiations among the specialists First of all we must create the necessary atmosphere and the necessary conditions We expect you to extend the invitation to our Russian delegation to come We are ready for negotiations When it comes to Tourism there is no need for special propaganda because Sri Lanka is a wellknown destination for Russians They are very happy when they come here We expect to mark in February 200000 arrivals by direct flights from Russia since they were resumed A lot of Russians are coming via Arab or Gulf countries too It is a big contribution to the Sri Lankan economy Q Is that one of the key elements or features of bilateral discussions at the moment Yes I just said in one of my press conferences that the ball is in your court because you have to sign respective agreements to join international treaties That is about physical security and some others Our colleagues in this organization and the foreign ministers know it Its very important that your country continues very useful cooperation with the IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna Q Sri Lanka is trying to play a kind of an active role in the Global South The President says the foreign policy is clearly Asiacentric So how does Russia view it actually It is very positive because Sri Lanka is one of our friendly countries historically We have never had any problems with Sri Lanka A lot of Sri Lankans have graduated from Russian and former Soviet universities We are very proud of that They have now occupied very important positions some in state bodies and others in private business They are very helpful in terms of furthering the development of bilateral relations between Russia and Sri Lanka We highly appreciate that once again in terms of Ukraine Sri Lanka as well as a major part of the Global South have adopted a neutral and balanced position Colombo didnt join sanctions against Russia because sanctions are counterproductive Okay Some countries that adopt neutral balanced positions dont join sanctions against Russia Q Is there any possibility for the Presidents of the two countries to meet actually There was a good opportunity in China recently during the Belt and Road BRI summit They only shook hands as far as I know I think its because of the fact that both the Presidents were occupied and their programmes were just agreed before Hopefully next time Maybe there will be some international meeting You know Russia has become the current President of BRICS BRICS has become larger Many countries have joined BRICS Saudi Arabia UAE Ethiopia and Egypt We highly appreciate Sri Lankas balanced and neutral position regarding Ukraine We expect the Sri Lankan government to preserve this neutral position as it is important to have good relations with the East and the West The West is now preoccupied with other issues such as the MiddleEast crisis Yes it is a crisis The main issue is that Palestinians were deprived of the possibility to have their own country for many decades They must have their own country within the borders of 1967 with the capital of Eastern Jerusalem They were deprived of it Thats where the roots of the conflict are Q Sri Lanka has also announced that it is willing to join BRICS What is your view I dont see any problem You have to meet some criteria For Sri Lanka I think its not a problem Sri Lanka has friendly relations with all the member countries BRICS has become a very popular international organization We will continue the integration of our economies and our cooperation in many fields It consists of many powerful countries like China India and South Africa Q Will Russia be cooperative with Sri Lanka Of course We expect a more active role of Sri Lanka in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Sri Lanka is currently the President of the IORA Indian Ocean Rim Association We are also a dialogue partner country There will be some meetings and some sessions Our delegations from Russia are ready to participate There was a Ministerial meeting last October Q In your view how long will the RussiaUkraine war drag on You know its difficult to say because you cannot compare the capability of Russia to Ukraine Theyre still resisting thanks to the help of Western countries But their lets say capability is being exhausted Americans have elections Europeans have huge economic problems Look whats going on in Germany Strikes by farmers by railway workers Theyre fed up with it They spend a lot of money for the puppet regime in Ukraine bankrupt and corrupt regime The West is now preoccupied with other issues such as the MiddleEast crisis Yes it is a crisis The main issue is that Palestinians were deprived of the possibility to have their own country for many decades They must have their own country within the borders of 1967 with the capital of Eastern Jerusalem They were deprived of it Thats where the roots of the conflict are"

        "body": "Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa was portrayed as a monument of efficiency who could uplift Sri Lanka by his Viyathmaga cronies and his family party the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP at the Presidential elections of 2019 More than 69 million people voted him to stupendous success Barely three years later Gotabaya fled Sri Lanka and resigned as President due to a mass uprising against him that was described as the Aragalaya A large number of the voters who elected him to office realised belatedly that their hero was an incompetent inefficient person who was unfit to be the President of Sri Lanka This notion of an inefficient Veda beri Gota was further reinforced this week by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka A threejudge bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena Gamini Amarasekara and Arjuna Obeysekera ordered to set aside the Presidential pardon granted by the former the President to exMP Duminda Silva for not following the Constitutional provisions correctly Of course some may say this was not merely proof of his inadequacy or inefficiency but also an indication of Gotas authoritarian arrogance Hirunika Mocks Former Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra mocked the exPresident after the landmark Supreme Court ruling As is well known Hirunika is the daughter of former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra for whose murder Duminda Silva was convicted Hirunnikas FR petition was one of the three taken up by the Supreme Court Addressing a media conference Hirunika Premachandra said that Gotabaya Rajapaksa was so ignorant that he could not even adopt the due procedure in granting a Presidential Pardon She further alleged that Gotabaya Rajapaksa gave into pressure by Duminda Silvas faction and signed the document to grant Duminda the Presidential pardon and ultimately ended up being humiliated Arumadura Lawrence Romelo Duminda Silva known as Duminda Silva was the fortunate recipient of a munificent Presidential Pardon on 24 June 2021 The convict on death row was released as a result of the pardon Duminda Silva a former Parliamentarian and exProvincial Councillor was involved in a shooting incident in October 2011 during Local Authority Elections where former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and three of his bodyguards were killed The High Court of Sri Lanka convicted Duminda Silva and four of his associates for murder and imposed the death sentence on them in September 2016 Subsequently the sentence was appealed but a fiveJudge bench of the Supreme Court upheld the murder conviction of Silva in October 2018 Despite the High Court conviction of 2016 being upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018 Duminda Silva was a free man in 2021 on Poson Poya Day The then President Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa invoking article 341 of the Constitution granted a Presidential pardon to 93 convicted prisoners including Duminda Silva on Poson Poya Day of 24 June 2021 FR Petitions Consequently Bharathas daughter and Ex MP Hirunika Premachandra her mother Sumana Premachandra and former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka HRCSL Ghazali Hussain filed three Fundamental Rights petitions challenging the legality of the Presidential pardon granted to Duminda Silva After hearing the three Fundamental Rights petitions filed challenging the legality of the Presidential pardon granted by Gotabaya Rajapaksa the Supreme Court ruled on 17 January 2024 that the former Presidents decision to grant a Presidential pardon to Duminda Silva was not valid in law and quashed it It was a unanimous decision of the threejudge bench Justice Preethi Padman Surasena delivered the judgement with Judges AGR Amarasekara and Arjuna Obeyesekere concurring The court declared that the pardon granted to Duminda Silva by the former President was null and void and had no effect in law As set out in Article 33h of the Constitution it has only empowered the President to do acts and things which would not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or written law Thus in this instance I hold that the former President has clearly violated the provisions in Section 3 q of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 04 of 2015 I have to accept the Petitioners argument that the instant grant of pardon to the recipient of the pardon by the former President of the country has totally eroded the confidence the public has reposed in the criminal justice system of the country stated Justice Surasena SC Ruling Conclusion The conclusion of the judgement was as follows I have no legal basis or even a factual basis to uphold the decision made by the former President to grant a pardon to the recipient in the instant case I hold that the said decision is arbitrary irrational and has been made for the reasons best known to the former President who appears to have not even made any written decision and has not given any reason thereto Further no reason can be discerned from any document submitted by Hon Attorney General as forming part of the record pertaining to the impugned grant of pardon The Petitioners are therefore entitled to succeed with their petitions I proceed to grant the following relief to the Petitioners in SC FRA No 221 2021 SC FRA No 225 2021 and SC FRA No 228 2021 a declaration that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Petitioners by Article 121 of

and SC FRA No 2252021 and the 4th Respondent in SC FRA No 2282021 by the President of the country former President is null and void and of no force or avail or any effect in law I proceed to quash the

The Jaffna district Parliamentarian cum Presidents Counsel observed thus This is a historic verdict Hitherto it was assumed that an Executive pardon was not justiciable This ground breaking judgment shows that no decision of the Executive is beyond review except perhaps the Declaration of War and Peace since that is specifically excluded in the Constitution This power of the President is clearly distinguishable from the Royal Prerogative and can be reviewed by court a welcome precedent that enhances the Rule of Law and militates against arbitrariness Let me conclude with a brief chronological outline of legal proceedings concerning the prosecution conviction and absolution of Duminda Silva Killed in Shootout Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra known as Lucky Aiya and three of his bodyguards were killed on 8 October 2011 in a shootout near the Walpola junction close to Mulleriyawa town about six miles away from Colombo city Another bodyguard was seriously injured Instead of the perpetrators being arrested the country was regaled with what appeared to be a massive coverup exercise There was an undue delay in effective legal proceedings being instituted There was a long period of perceived procrastination attributed euphemistically to the laws delays The matter dragged on for years and it was widely believed that the aphorism Justice Delayed is Justice Denied was being proven true in this instance also The advent of a new dispensation under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 saw a fresh breeze blowing in musty judicial corridors The AttorneyGeneral filed an indictment in courts on March 2015 for the killings of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra Dharshana Jayathilake Mohamed Azmi and Manivel Kumaraswamy and also for inflicting gunshot injuries on Rajapurage Gamini TrialatBar The indictment consisted of 17 charges against 13 suspects including Duminda Silva The then Chief Justice Kanagasabapathy Sripavan appointed in May 2015 a threemember bench for TrialatBar proceedings The bench comprised three High Court Judges namely Shiran Guneratne Pathmini Ranawaka and MCBS Moraes The Chairman was Shiran Guneratne TrialatBar proceedings began on 22 May 2015 The case was heard on a regular basis from 12 September 2015 The names of the 13 accused were Chandana Jagath Kumara Lanka Rasanjana Malaka Sameera Widanagamage Amila Suranga Premalal Saman Kumara Saman Abeywickrema Rohana Marasinghe Duminda Silva Anura Thushara de Mel Chaminda Ravi Jayanath alias Dematagoda Chaminda Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Sarath Bandara and Janaka Bandara Galagoda The last named was tried in absentia as he was absconding The accused were charged under Sections 296 140 146 147 486 and 300 of the Penal Code and some clauses of the Firearms Act Among the 17 charges were committing and conspiring to commit murder of four individuals attempted murder possessing illegal firearms inflicting gunshot injuries unlawful assembly and criminal intimidation on or around 8 October 2011 A team of lawyers from the Attorney Generals Department led by Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige represented the prosecution 42 witnesses testified in Courts and 126 documents including Government Analysts reports and JMO reports were produced Two to One Verdict TrialatBar proceedings concluded on 14 July 2016 The verdict in the high profile trial was delivered on 8 September 2016 It was a divided verdict with two of three Judges finding five of the accused guilty and acquitting eight others One judge however found all 13 accused not guilty High Court Judge Pathmini N Ranawaka pronounced the two to one majority verdict in the packed Courthouse with Judge Moraes concurring Judge Pathmini Ranawaka delivering the majority verdict stated that the prosecution had proved during the trial that the provocative conduct of 11th accused Duminda Silva led to the whole incident Courts then acquitted and discharged eight of the accused They were Chandana Jagath Kumara Lanka Rasanjana Malaka Sameera Widanagamage Amila Suranga Premalal Saman Kumara Saman Abeywickrema and Rohana Marasinghe Death Sentence The death sentence was pronounced for five persons They were Duminda Silva Anura Thushara De Mel Chaminda Ravi Jayanath alias Dematagoda Chaminda Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Sarath Bandara and Janaka Bandara Galagoda he 10th accused Janaka Bandara Galagoda was tried in absentia and convicted In addition to the verdict of execution the five convicted persons were also fined Rs 40000 each Appeal to Supreme Court The TrialatBar High Court ruling was appealed at the Supreme Court A fiveJudge bench of the Supreme Court presided over by the then Chief Justice Priyasath Dep upheld the conviction unanimously Chief Justice Dep issued a 51page ruling on 11 October 2018 The outgoing Chief Justice Priyasath Dep in his order noted a string of crimes including election law violations committed by Silva and his cohorts culminating in the killing of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and three others The fiveJudge bench arrived at a unanimous decision The others on the bench were justices Nalin Perera Buwaneka Aluwihare Priyantha Jayawardena and Vijith K Malalgoda The Supreme Court upheld that Bharatha Lakshman and three others were shot dead at the behest of Duminda Silva Arbitrary and Irrational Though convicted for murder Duminda Silva was pardoned due to the clemency of President Rajapaksa No explanation was given In that context it is indeed poetic justice that the Supreme Court ruling chides the acts of omission and commission by Gotabaya Rajapaksa as arbitrary and irrational DBS Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyarajyahoocom"

        "body": "Apart from the SLFP which seems to be taking every effort to field its leader former President Maithripala Sirisena at the race for the top most post amidst a leadership crisis and a danger of MPs of the party deserting the leader three prominent businessmen have also openly entered the fray The statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on January 15 on the Presidential election that is constitutionally scheduled to be held in September or October this year might be the most important one for those who are interested in that election The leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP told journalists after a meeting at the Grand Monarch Hotel in Thalawathugoda that his party had neither decided on a candidate for the Presidential election nor even whether to contest that election It was just exactly a month ago on December 15 the frontliners of the SLPP led by the Rajapaksa family vowed at its second national convention at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium to secure victory in all upcoming elections Now leave alone winning elections the party is not in a position to decide whether to contest the most important election of the country The SLPP was a party which within two years after it was formed swept the electorate at the 2018 local government elections the first test of power it encountered after its formation It also recorded a mammoth victory at the Presidential election in 2019 as well with its candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa bagging 69 million votes However the mismanagement of its first government was such that within three years the country saw the first massive public uprising in its history which forced the President to flee the country The twice President Rajapaksas statement invalidates all the recent chest thumping by the SLPP leaders on their partys capacity to face any election It definitely has a demoralizing impact on the remaining members and supporters of the party that is already fast thinning out Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake the leaders of the two Balawegayas the main Opposition in Parliament the Samagi Jana Balawegaya SJB and the Jathika Jana Balawegaya or the National Peoples Power NPP have announced their candidature for the forthcoming Presidential election The Management Committee of the UNP has decided on January 9 to field the party leader for the contest However SLPP Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa had stated later that President Wickremesinghe is also one of the possible candidates who would contest on behalf of his party Party Chairman Vajira Abeywardena and some other leaders of the party which failed to win a single Parliamentary seat at district level at the last general election claimed that Wickremesinghe would get 10 million votes at the Presidential election Apart from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party SLFP which seems to be taking every effort to field its leader former President Maithripala Sirisena at the race for the top most post amidst a leadership crisis and a danger of MPs of the party deserting the leader three prominent businessmen have also openly entered the fray Dilith Jayaweera who owns a string of media outlets rejuvenated the Mavbima Janatha Party MJP of Hemakumara Nanayakkara and was elected to its leadership in last September He is travelling around the country holding public meetings to introduce himself to the public Business tycoon Dammika Perera who was earlier said by the SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam to be one of the four possible candidates of his party might have been dumbfounded with the vacillating remarks by the party leader on the partys Presidential candidacy Former Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka PUCSL Janaka Ratnayake is also occasionally renewing his announcement of candidacy as if woken up from a deep slumber Tamil votes especially those from the north seem at the moment not to go to any Sinhalese candidate as a result of the current debate whether Tamils should boycott the election or field a Tamil common candidate The biggest loser of this debate might be the SJB followed by the NPP However the largest portion of Muslim votes as evident at the moment would side with the NPP leaving their leaders who are primarily in the SJB However only the two Balawegayas seem to be campaigning for the top most race with clear party mandates with the NPP leader becoming the biggest crowd puller The huge womens meetings held by the NPP in Galle Matara and Hambantota this month have alarmed the other possible main contenders provoking them to launch a scathing attack on the former rebels They call upon the people not to venture into experiments at elections which amount to a call to vote for those parties that dragged the country along a destructive path for the past 75 years Against this backdrop politicians in the southern parts of the country seem to be struggling to decide where they should stand in the coming months No policies or principles matter in these manoeuvrings Assurances of positions alone would determine everything Finally the outcome would justify the means Accordingly the Parliamentarian and former Chief Minister of the Southern Province Shan Wijayalal De Silva summersaulted from the SLFP to the SJB on January 1 followed by former UPFA Parliamentarian Dayashritha Tissera on January 4 They were offered organiser posts for the Ambalangoda and Naththandiya electorates respectively by the SJB leader Three recent dissidents of the SLPP Professor GLPeiris Dilan Perera and Dr Nalaka Godahewa who later became the frontrunners of the newly formed Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa of Dullas Alahapperuma were also seen at a press briefing of the SJB on January 4 However offering positions to the newcomers seems to have created apprehensions among the existing organisers of the SJB despite it possibly having a luring effect on the likely turncoats of other parties The movements of politicians to and from political parties in Sri Lanka are generally not driven by principles but by personal agendas and urges for survival The groups such as those under Dullas Alahapperuma Wimal Weeraansa and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa decamped from the SLPP only because they were sidelined by the National Organiser of that party Basil Rajapaksa Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila were removed from the Cabinet by Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 3 2022 after they criticised the New Fortress Energy Agreement However they managed within a month to persuade Rajapaksa who was beleaguered by the economic crisis to sack his cabinet to form an AllParty Government which includes themselves without any change in that agreement Had that plan not been scuttled by the Aragalaya they would have been in the government to date Vasudeva Nanayakkara of Wimal Weerawansas Uththara Lanka Sabhagaya ULS had stated days ago that they were prepared to work with the NPP on a plan against the programme involving the IMF However sensing a political advance towards them by the ULS NPP heavyweight Lal Kantha had stated that his party would not entertain the likes of Dullas and Wimal This might be a valid stance with regard to those who seeking positions but not others as without embracing others the NPP cannot be strengthened The situation on the ground demands the UNP and the SLPP to work together as the vote banks of both parties have drastically eroded The claims about ten million votes by the UNP leaders have to be taken with a pinch of salt in the light of the two main parties fear of holding local government elections UNP leaders who boast about their party having salvaged the country from the economic crisis are blind to the reality on the ground or are pretending to be so In spite of the absence of queues for fuel and cooking gas the sufferings endured by the people are more brutal than what they underwent in 2022 before and after the Aragalaya Only the repressive actions by the government have prevented people now from taking to the streets Unless the two ruling parties accept the situation the frustration of the people would be manifested at the forthcoming elections in a manner that many parties never revive"

        "body": "Foreign Minister Ali Sabry addressing the NAM ministerial meeting in Kampala on Wednesday The NonAligned Movement once a beacon of hope for a more just and equitable world is holding its 19th summit in Kampala But does anyone care The last summit was held in Azerbaijan in October 2019 months before the COVID19 outbreak which delivered a stark lesson humanitys survival hinges on solidarity and a global order built on justice But no sooner had the pandemic eased off than powerful nations were back to their dirty games driven by a desire not to bring about global justice but to perpetuate the imbalance that made the rich richer and the poor poorer Azerbaijans fouryear NAM stewardship did not contribute even to a minor course correction in the warped world order in which most NAM countries are doomed to remain poor or get entrapped in poverty and debt The theme of the 2019 Baku summit was Upholding Bandung principles to ensure a concerted and adequate response to the challenges of the contemporary world A highfaluting theme but inaction speaks loudly about NAMs impotency The theme referred to the Bandung principles the then newly independent nations adopted in 1955 to promote Third World solidarity and pursue common interests during the bipolar international order defined by the Cold War tension between the USled Western bloc and the Soviet Unionled Eastern bloc The Bandung principles that nurtured solidarity and unity among developing nations were political selfdetermination mutual respect for sovereignty nonaggression noninterference in internal affairs and equality NAM set up in 1961 was like a family The world stopped and listened to whatever statements NAM made and whatever decisions came out of its summits The West saw the united stand NAM took at world forums as a major obstacle to its global pursuits These forums where NAM took the West headon included deliberations on the Law of the Sea global trade talks to ensure a fair price for developing countries exports and solutions to global conflicts especially the Palestinian peoples struggle to free themselves from the Zionist colonial yoke But what has NAM done under Azerbaijans leadership to respond to global challenges Not even Azerbaijan knows the answer to this serious question When Israels response to the October 7 Hamas attacks took a genocidal turn in Palestine a full member of NAM the Azerbaijani presidency was furtively silent Probably Azerbaijan thought that taking a neutral stand was the best way to express its gratitude for all the weapons Israel supplied for it to complete the ethnic cleansing of NagornoKarabakh in September last year What nurtures IsraeliAzerbaijani friendship is their animosity towards Iran For Israel Azerbaijan which shares a 689kmlong border with Iran is a strategic asset and a listening post A majority of Azerbaijanis are Shiite Muslims but Islam is more a cultural identity than a religion and therefore siding with Israel when Gaza is being obliterated does not evoke much public anger Azerbaijan was the only Muslim country that did not participate in the Riyadh Islamic countries conference convened in November to discuss the Gaza war Azerbaijan meets 40 percent of Israels fuel requirements including the fuel for Israeli tanks and aircraft that kill civilians and children in the Gaza Strip So much for Azerbaijans NAM leadership and solidarity Perhaps the NAM chair added an ornamental value to the host nation But why blame Azerbaijan alone Look at India It has long abandoned NAM solidarity and the Palestinian cause that NAM is morally bound to champion What about Sri Lanka another NAM stalwart Sri Lanka is perhaps the first country to openly veer away from NAM even before India In its editorial comment on January 14 the Sunday Times explains this shift referring to then President JR Jayewardene breaking ranks with the NAM and voting in favour of Britain during a United Nations vote on the invasion of Argentinas Malvinas Falklands There it was a case of not nonalignment but strategic alignment as Britain was then funding the Victoria Dam project the editorial said This strategic alignment was also seen at the 2003 World Trade Organisation Conference in Cancun Mexico where Sri Lanka abandoned the common stand that NAM members took to push for a better deal for developing countries concerning agriculture nonagricultural market access and services To the shock of other NAM nations including India Premier Ranil Wickremesinghes government backed the position taken by the United States and other rich Western nations which opposed special treatment for developing nations Sri Lankas policy of supporting Palestine and joining the proIsraeli alliance against Yemens Houthi forces in the Red Sea may make sense when seen through the strategic alignment prism But being seen as aligning with Israel at a time when tens of thousands of children have been killed by Israel in Gaza is reprehensible It was not the socalled strategic alignment that prompted South Africa to take Israel before the International Court of Justice and stop the ongoing genocide in Gaza It is South Africas commitment to principles and global justice that makes it take a bold decision on behalf of humanity In his address to the ministerial conference in Kampala Sri Lankas Foreign Minister Ali Sabry reaffirmed Sri Lankas solidarity with the people of Palestine during the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and stated that Sri Lanka would continue to support them in their quest to realize their inalienable right to Statehood If its claim is true then it must support South Africas ICJ petition just as a host of NAM countries have done Sri Lanka and other developing countries that adopt the strategic alignment principle to promote their national interest do so at the cost of ditching the collective bargaining power that brought multiple benefits to NAM nations during their unity and solidarity days Given these realpolitik moves some may dismiss NAMs Kampala summit as yet another talk shop or no different from the 2019 Baku summit However in one aspect it may differ from the Baku summit The Kampala summit is taking place at a time when developing nations are showing a renewed interest in the Global South concept Global South a term that has been of late gaining political currency is not exclusively interpreted geographically Rather it is a geopolitical and geoeconomic concept in which likeminded developing countries irrespective of their geographical locations form an informal coalition to fight for economic justice and challenge the dominance of their Global North counterparts However there is still some confusion as to what and who constitutes the Global South At times China and India may seem to be part of the Global South and at other times they are not especially when they assert their newly gained military and economic powers BRICS which is now a 10member grouping is also emerging as a Global South force As the Global South is reawakened and the concept finds its footing in world politics this weeks NAM and G77 summits in Kampala offer a flicker of hope for developing countries to reassert their power on the global stage through united action The summits response to the Gaza genocide perhaps will indicate whether this is true or not"

        "body": "The management of fisheries resources is fundamental to ensure food security of the country The FAO also highlights that the fisheries sector in Sri Lanka faces various challenges including overfishing illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing and declining fish stocks The FAO says climate change and its impacts on the marine environment also pose threats to the sustainability of fisheries Quality is lost because of the lack of cooling or refrigeration facilities in fishing vessels Dr Palitha Kithsiri says the quality of fish could be assured at the highest level at landing sites if such facilities were made available Quality loss is as high as 80 percent in the southern part of Sri Lanka When fish is graded lower it will be used only for dry fish production as it is not suitable for a normal seafood market he said in a discussion with Daily Mirror When you stroll through your seafood market you find the oceans bounty laid out in stalls in front of you But have you ever paused to ponder whether the quality of fish you bring home holds the distinguished mark of the highest grade The answer is probably no The fishing industry plays a key role in Sri Lankas social and economic life and consists of three main sub sectors coastal offshore or deep sea and inland or aquaculture According to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO of the UN the sector contributes significantly to the economic development of Sri Lanka by providing livelihoods to more than 25 million coastal communities In its latest research paper the FAO outlines that fish make up about 50 percent of Sri Lankans animal protein intake a ratio three times the global average Today the sector is suffering a doublewhammy One is the impact triggered by climate change and the other the postharvest quality loss from the poor handling of fish In fact 4060 percent quality loss is reported in Sri Lanka according to the FAOs Fisheries Specialist for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Dr H M Palitha Kithsiri Once harvested fish is graded as A B C or D in terms of quality determined according to thickness odour Histamine level etc However quality is lost because of the lack of cooling or refrigeration facilities in fishing vessels Dr Kithsiri said the quality of fish could be assured at the highest level at landing sites if such facilities were made available Quality loss is as high as 80 percent in the southern part of Sri Lanka When fish is graded lower it will be used only for dry fish production as it is not suitable for a normal seafood market he said in a discussion with Daily Mirror As a solution the FAO is proposing the improvement of facilities in multiday fishing vessels Once harvested fish stocks are stored using ice or ice packs in holding facilities in vessels In multiday vessels fish stocks are stored for four to eight weeks But ice starts melting after about one week To address this issue as a pilot project the FAO has introduced economically viable refrigeration facilities We are now checking the fish quality We will get the reports soon he said Now the FAO is introducing this advanced cooling system particularly for the benefit of longline fishermen who catch yellowfin tuna for the export market Poor handling is another issue leading to the quality drop The management of fisheries resources is fundamental to ensure food security of the country Sri Lanka is currently practicing aquaculture farming especially for Penaeus monodon Vannamei shrimp and crabs These are good income generating sources to the industry which will help improve fishing stock status and market recognition In the research paper the FAO also highlights that the fisheries sector in Sri Lanka faces various challenges including overfishing illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing and declining fish stocks The FAO says climate change and its impacts on the marine environment also pose threats to the sustainability of fisheries An important part of the fish stocks that Sri Lankan fishers harvest is degraded and catches are declining When managed in an environmentally socially and financially sustainable manner fisheries including coastal and aquaculture hold significant promise for increased export earnings and skilled jobs Actions need to be taken to minimize postharvest losses to assure harvested product quantity and quality the FAO says Despite Sri Lanka being an island with the potential for a blue economy Sri Lanka is one of the main fish and fishery products importing countries in South Asia especially due to the inadequate domestic production of dried fish and sprats According to the FAO the development of fisheries affiliated industries upstream and downstream is crucial and has direct impacts on the sustainable development of the fisheries industry in the country In this case producing inputs production related and infrastructure related inputs is the key Fishing crafts or boats fishing gear and ice are major productionrelated inputs while harbours anchorages and landing centres are infrastructurerelated inputs Both women and men play different roles in the fishing sector although geographical and ethnic variations exist according to the FAO Fish harvesting is predominantly done by men Women engage in gleaning or harvesting fish prawns crabs clams and mussels in coastal waters Women also mainly perform postharvest activities notably drying The FAO along with the government and other stakeholders has implemented strategies and initiatives to contribute to the sustainable use and conservation of fisheries resources while ensuring food and nutritional security in the country It is providing technical support to improve hatchery skills for quality seed production through good practices better management and upgrading the hatchery facilities recently established by NAQDA National Aquaculture Development Authority Adaptation to climate change is yet another challenge the FAO is now promoting to ensure the sustainability of the industry The FAO says climate change affects fish and their habitats Warmer temperatures influence the abundance migratory patterns and mortality rates of wild fish stocks and determine what species can be farmed in certain regions These climatic effects on fish will have social and economic consequences for people dependent on fisheries and aquaculture from workers to coastal communities to consumers of fish the FAO says Fishing vessel design adaptation to climate change increasing fuel efficiency on multiday vessels and establishing and improving safety measures for the fishery sector are among project activities being undertaken by the FAO In navigating the complexities of Sri Lankas fishing industry a harmonious blend of innovation sustainability and genderinclusive practices emerges as the beacon of hope As the nation grapples with these challenges a concerted effort is underway to ensure that the bounty of the ocean continues to enrich lives and livelihoods for generations to come"

        "headline": "Four Priorities for Sri Lanka in Election Year 2024",
        "body": "In 2024 Sri Lanka faces two major challenges Having largely achieved macroeconomic stability with inflation falling from 70 to 2 percent the country needs to resume economic growth which has been negative for the last two years The Sri Lankan people have suffered too long with declining incomes Growth is also critical for the debt restructuring programme which aims for a debttoGDP ratio of 95 percent This is a high number A large external shock or a round of reckless policies could throw Sri Lanka into another debt crisis To avoid this outcome the country needs to accelerate growth to lower the debttoGDP ratio and reinforce the sustainability of debt Secondly 2024 is an election year If past elections in Sri Lanka and elsewhere are a guide there will be a flurry of populist proposals by the government and opposition parties aimed at currying favour with the voters Candidates promise handouts and subsidy increases without mentioning how they will be financed Ghana increases public servant salaries every election year despite being in a debt crisis they raised them by 30 percent this year I advised the Finance Minister of another country to cut fuel subsidies and health expenditures on the rich He said they would do it after the elections They lost the election Sri Lanka cannot risk these populist policies when it needs to accelerate growth It should avoid the competitive populism of past electoral campaigns where each candidate offers an even more generous handout than the competitors The erstwhile rice subsidy scheme was a victim of this phenomenon at its peak the subsidy cost 6 percent of the GDP More recently the unfunded tax cuts of 2019 were a campaign promise of the previous President Sri Lanka is currently implementing the growthoriented structural reforms that are part of the programme agreed to with the International Monetary Fund IMF The list is long Verits IMF Tracker shows more than a hundred commitments To reduce the risk of another economic crisis brought on by populist policies I suggest that the government prioritize those reforms that are either i difficult to reverse or ii constrain future governments from reckless behaviour These reforms are different from strokeofthepen reforms such as changing a tax rate which are important and necessary but reversible as we saw in 2019 The goal here is to put in place measures that make it difficult to lower the tax rate in future without corresponding revenue increases expenditure cuts or prudent financing options What would these reforms be From the lists in the governments programme the Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report and the IMFs Governance Diagnostic Assessment I would suggest the following four priorities 1 Protect the Independence of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka The Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act of 2023 CBA prohibits the government from financing its fiscal deficit by borrowing directly from the Central Bank Not having such an Act in 201922 led to the recordhigh inflation of 70 percent Following the tax cuts of 2020 the fiscal deficit soared to 12 percent of GDP The government resorted to borrowing from the Central Bank that is printing money As the textbooks would predict the result was one of the highest inflation rates in the world Having the CBA in place will act as a constraint on the size of the fiscal deficit If the government cannot finance the deficit by borrowing from the Central Bank it will think twice about policies such as tax cuts or expenditure increases that raise the fiscal deficit Although Sri Lanka has a CBA the real test of the independence of the Central Bank will come this election year The Central Bank will come under pressure to finance the electionfueled fiscal deficit The CBA should be protected from such pressures without exception 2 Targeted Cash Transfers A wellfunctioning cash transfer system one that is targeted at the poor and not politically captured is essential for providing much needed support to the poor and vulnerable Sri Lankans The Samurdhi program was poorly targeted only 40 percent of the poor receive transfers and 16 percent of the nonpoor also receive them There is evidence of political capture Districts that voted between 40 and 60 percent for the incumbent party received the most Samurdhi transfers regardless of how poor they were According to one study The niyamakas said that they are under pressure from area politicians and villagelevel party organisations to give the Samurdhi grant to incumbent party families and to deny them to opposition party supporters When a new system Aswesuma was introduced the people who were dropped from the rolls protested A number of members of Parliament who had recently approved the reform demanded that these people be put back on the list pending a review of their eligibility The review has yet to be completed To make the cash transfer system watertight the criteria for eligibility should be robust target the poor and difficult to manipulate The proposal for transfers to households that use less than 60 kilowatt hours per month which would reach over 80 percent of the poorest 10 percent of households is an example of the former Electronic transfers help with the latter A wellfunctioning cash transfer system also makes it easier to reform regressive and inefficient subsidies on fuel and electricity When governments try to reform these subsidies upper and middleclass people with their gasguzzling cars and air conditioners will definitely be hurt and will protest saying that the reform will hurt the poor With a targeted cash transfer system the government can as governments in other countries have done increase the transfers to the poor so they can pay the higher prices for fuel and electricity and call the upper classes bluff 3 Taxation of Corporate Profits Sri Lanka offers tax holidays and exemptions to domestic and foreign investors The evidence that these exemptions attract foreign investment is extremely thin Most foreign investors are looking for stability not zero taxes Furthermore the country currently needs tax revenues badly While the poor and middle classes are paying higher Value Added Taxes VAT and income taxes many rich corporations pay nothing And tax exemptions provide plenty of scope for corruption sweetheart deals between investors and politically connected individuals The current policy is that most corporations will be taxed except for strategic investments As long as there is this exemption the policy will be ineffective Instead there should be a minimum positive tax rate on all domestic and foreign corporations without exception In the European Union Ireland has such a low uniform tax rate whereas Germany has a complex set of exemptions and multiple rates Ireland collects four times as much corporate tax revenues per capita as Germany 4 Transparency As US Justice Louis Brandeis said Sunlight is the best disinfectant Publishing all procurement contracts over Rs 1 billion the asset declarations of senior government officials and the names of all firms receiving tax exemptions as recommended by both the aforementioned governance diagnostics will go a long way towards preventing the excesses of the past Publishing this information provides incentives for people to refrain from profligate behaviour In this election year another transparency measure would be for the independent thinktanks to calculate the fiscal costs of the various proposals of the candidates and disseminate them to the public These four priorities are not the only things that need to be done this year To accelerate growth Sri Lanka needs to remove the antiexport bias that has plagued the economy for a long time These four reforms are important to avoid the excesses that usually accompany an election season and sometimes the postelection period Moreover these reforms will signal to the international community official and private creditors as well as international financial institutions that Sri Lanka is putting in place the institutional reforms needed to avoid a replay of the 2022 crisis That increase in confidence is worth a lot Professor Shantayanan Devarajan is a Professor of the Practice of International Development Georgetown University He is also a nonresident fellow of Verit Research and a member of its Sri Lanka Economic Policy Group"

are tools through which a countrys geopolitical standing is constantly being tested especially in contested waters After Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7 the US promptly dispatched two carrier battle groups to the Gulf and the Mediterranean The purpose was to deter potential antiIsraeli elements rallying around to attack Israel Global powers constantly use their naval prowess to showcase their intentions by deploying their naval assets in various parts of the world Most of the time these naval assets will be used to serve specific national interests Sri Lanka is no different it has done the same in the past and will be doing the same in the future The Sri Lankan President stated that a decision has been taken to dispatch a Sri Lankan Naval Vessel to Bab El Mandeb to protect international shipping lines from Houthi attacks While this statement should be taken with a pinch of salt particularly with regard to how willing the political leadership would be to invest in these vessels via operational expenses surveillance equipment and supporting logistics at a time of dire economic crisis at home this is at the same time a welcoming opportunity that the Navy should not miss Sri Lanka Navy and the National Interest The Sri Lanka Navy has executed its naval deployments in meeting national interests on previous occasions as well The then Royal Ceylon Navy was involved in transferring the sacred Tooth Relics of the Buddha by ship to and from Myanmar in 1950 From more recent times the Navy embarked on a hallmark deployment in hunting down separatist terrorist floating warehouses from 2007 to 2008 Once the military will and political will synergized a bold decision was taken to go after the center of gravity of the separatist terrorists The fleet of coastal freighters engaged in gunrunning and seeking refuge in highseas at ranges The enemy felt wrongly the Navy would not dare approach these seas Then later with the looming drug menace the Navy again went out to the high seas This time it ventured into the south of the Arabian Sea in search of Iranian dhows that acted as the mother ships to transfer drugs to Sri Lankan fishing vessels Before that decision was taken in 2019 the Sri Lankan Navy sought assistance from the Indian Navy and the Bahrain based Combined Maritime Force CMF as the Sri Lankan Navy concluded that the Arabian Sea was not an operational area for them But when both India and the CMF declined to provide assistance on the pretext of vessel unavailability the NHQ decided to engage in the operation by itself The rest is history with arrests of several mother vessels and Sri Lankan fishing vessels engaged in the peddling of drugs In deploying Naval assets the primary factor to consider is simply What for What is the necessity Is it in our national interest In the cases mentioned above there was a clear national interest particularly considering that the South Arabian Sea is an area of operational interests At the same time for separatist terrorism the vast sea area towards the south and southeast reaching up to the immediate periphery of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone was an area of interest The question to ask here is would BabElMandeb also constitute a national interest This analysis intends to discuss that prospect against the need to balance the cost of operational expenses The Purpose of Being a Club Member It would be good to take part in regional naval affairs as these would enhance our credibility and gain us acceptance as a regional partner Do we have to go to great lengths to prove this however The author believes that we need not as our Navy is already performing a major role that has been appreciated in many naval forums We have ensured that our maritime jurisdiction remains safe and secure and have collaborated with all Search and Rescue Regions adjacent to us in coordinating maritime affairs Further we are already an active partner in securing the drug routes to Australia the Maldives and the BoB region The major navies would want to jump into these hotspots not to engage in fighting but to train their men and machinery How much you learn by operating in these hotspots is known by these Navies and no simulation can possibly replace it It is a matter of operating close to the hotspots but NOT within the hotspots In the mid1980s US Navy learnt some hard lessons in their skirmishes in the Strait of Hormuz when they were challenged by Iranian small boats The US tactics heavily depended on airpower helicopters primarily more than naval power In such high tempo intense and dynamic conflicts the machinery and the men behave very differently In one of several instances the USS Vincennes shot down Iranian Air Flight 655 on July 3 1988 The flight took off from Bandar Abbas and was mistakenly identified as a fastapproaching speedboat A main reason why the SL Navy should not miss this opportunity is that it provides the SL Navy with a reason to operate in an oceanic area that has a direct bearing on our battle against drug peddling in the Arabian Sea The author as a maritime practitioner has come across no regional or extraregional navy that is interested in intercepting drugs and narcotics in the Arabian Sea bound for Sri Lanka For the USSR of that time it was the moment of retaliation as Russians had been blamed for shooting down Korean Airlines Flight 007 over the Sakhalin Islands on September 1 1983 In just days the US Navy deployment changed as naval assets were withdrawn and hostilities gradually died down in the Strait of Hormuz Are we ready for these kinds of situations Are we ready to get involved in more international engagements and geostrategic pressures when we have run into a mess managing our own affairs History indicates that the purposes of these extraordinary decisions to reach out for global affairs are twofold On one hand these are distractions from internal political issues and on the other hand they are situations in which you can be both present and not present at the same time In other words they are convenient ways by which we can commit to something through words but not through actions The author having analyzed the Presidents thought process in media bulletins feels it to be a set of empty words where the underlying thought may be brilliant but at the same time lacks a proper action plan or strategy Had the President walked his talk this island nation would not have been like this in the context of global competition dictated by maritime matters To operate in these tense waters our Offshore Patrol Vessels OPVs will need new installations in the form of thermal cameras and stabilized platforms which we have not replaced since 2009 We would need better Electronic Warfare EW suits as not all our EW equipment is now operational On the weaponry front the OPVs are still capable of effectively countering surface and drone threats It is a matter of revitalizing the old training techniques we deployed to counter the aerial threats and potential missile attacks Any drone or surface vessels that are approaching our own units can be brought under a tremendous cone of fire thereby destroying them However Houthis are sending missiles as well The asymmetric nature of the warfare has changed a lot in technological terms so much so that the US Navy is competing with a nonstate actor who uses commercial drones antiship missiles and small manned and unmanned surface vessels This is the ideal testing ground for Indias defense industry that has expanded exponentially in recent years and they are there too Even though on the pretext of protecting Indian national interests this is the time to test how combat effective the radars sensors surveillance instruments and the new combat helicopters are These situations do not present in this format frequently to be there yet nottobe there The Navy Should Not Miss This Moment The Presidents statement at a time of economic crisis in the island nation is an opportunity the Navy should not miss Since 2022 there hardly has been any capital investment in the armed forces let alone in the Navy Despite boasting of a large defense budget the author has determined that there was less than 30 of state capital expenditure spent on defense budgets Thus the Head of States wishes would need to be exploited to the hilt so as to obtain investments in todays operational necessities The second reason why the SL Navy should not miss this opportunity is that it provides the SL Navy with a reason to operate in an oceanic area that has a direct bearing on our battle against drug peddling in the Arabian Sea The author as a maritime practitioner has come across no regional or extraregional navy that is interested in intercepting drugs and narcotics in the Arabian Sea bound for Sri Lanka Thus it is time we extend our operational interest to the Gulf of Yemen and the Arabian Sea though perhaps not in the northern part whilst amalgamating our national interests in fighting the drug menace from the sea with the political interests of operating in partnership with other countries in the south of the Red Sea The only drawback the author foresees is that Sri Lanka will be tagged as a partner for US led initiatives thereby indirectly hinting at a possible association with the QUAD camp at the expense of the China camp The freemedia opinion makers will endorse these perspectives possibly the Indian defense analysts more than our own political leaders By operating in the south of the Red Sea what do we stand to get After all if the government goes ahead and invests in absolutely required technological necessities the Sri Lanka Navy can reach out and operate in partnership with regional and extraregional navies This belies another problem Would Iran and the Gulf countries endorse our presence The political thinking in the Gulf countries has changed a lot in the last five years and the global divisions that have resulted from the recent IsraelGaza War are significant and cannot be simply forgotten If these Gulf countries were totally in support of the US we would have seen a Gulf Coalition by now But do we see any The author is of the view that there is a growing tide of global opinion and this tide is against the US and Europe and not necessarily Sri Lanka In that sense the author believes that we need not worry about burning our fingers yet On the other hand a countrys naval assets cannot be the sacrificial lamb or the price for political miscalculations a point that has much relevance given that history is full of such costly blunders Rear Admiral Y N Jayarathna Retd was the Chief of Staff and Chief Hydrographer of the Sri Lanka Navy and Joint Chief Hydrographer

Money Laundering Act Earlier Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage directed the Central Bank to submit a report on bank accounts maintained by Kodithuwakku and imposed an overseas travel ban on the suspect The latest incident comes in the wake of the recent appearance of several selfstyled prophets who claim to offer solutions to earthly problems and otherworldly salvation Two weeks ago mass suicides involving followers of a death cult led by another selfstyled preacher shocked the country The main culprit Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratne a former chemist had encouraged his disciples to commit suicide to fasttrack the end of Sansara the continued cycle of life and had distributed packets of a poisonous substance similar to Cyanide Police launched an investigation only after the suicide of the suspect which was followed by a mass suicide of his wife and children and several followers Seven suicides have been recorded related to the cult In another incident a Christian pastor Jerome Fernando senior overseer of The Glorious Church in Colombo was arrested over charges of insulting other religions He is accused of disparaging Buddhism and Islam in his inhouse sermons and is charged

enhanced existential identity crisis in some cases aggravated by the financial crisis though some of the most devoted followers of Pastor Jerome surely have deep pockets The commercialization of Buddhism may add to that crisis The Chief Prelates the Mahanayakas in a letter to the President sought legal action against those who defame Buddhism In a joint letter the prelates have demanded the

advocacy to defend religious rights and push back against distortions are in short supply Instead the standard course of action is selective outrage guided by paranoia and petty intolerance Selective

Gotabaya Rajapaksas Presidential victory fit in this discourse Where would the Dolakanda monk who claimed to perform miracles and his congregation that caused a public health hazard fit in Where would Dammika Peniya the infamous antiCOVID tonic coopted by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration fit in High priests were strangely silent in the face of such statesanctioned manipulations A call for caution might have gone a long way in shielding the faithful from these commonplace scams Sadly though commonsense rationale and proactive advocacy to defend religious rights and push back against distortions are in short supply Instead the standard course of action is selective outrage guided by paranoia and petty intolerance not the strength of tolerance that Buddhism advocates Buddhism should not be a mirror image of intolerance of the other Religious leaders or politicians who seek to import lessons of religious control from elsewhere do not take us to the future rather they drag us to the past This brings us to the final point Recently while selfstyle conmen were making a killing and duping their followers only to find fault with the system when they talked trash on Buddhism the law enforcement agencies were more at ease in arresting poets YouTube commentators and a standup comedian for allegedly insulting religion and on two separate incidents over advocating for extremism Such witchhunts do not make a religion secure Contemporary history of religion would reveal that religion guarded with paranoid zeal at the expense of Fundamental Rights would breed its own monsters which would cannibalize not just the faithful but the whole society Whereas the comedians job is to lampoon a society without poets would be as miserable as one with too much religion Follow

Pic courtesy The Herstories Project Sri Lanka A broken pair of rubber slippers kept on a display caught this writers eye as she walked into the ICES auditorium to witness an exhibition that explored Womens Histories of Sex Work during the conflict One may wonder as to what a pair of slippers possibly had to do at an exhibition that explored a topic that is seldom spoken about in Sri Lankan society But the slippers had a story of their own The trilingual display read how this pair of slippers was the first gift that a girl received from her boyfriend But upon suspicion that she had had an affair with his friend the boyfriend had not only beaten her with the slippers but had eventually deserted her The pair of slippers is her first memory of a pleasant relationship Now this girl is a sex worker but her boyfriend remains her first love Complexities of the commercial sex industry As such stories of 35 women from across the country were documented by Radhika Hettiarachchi along with the Grassrooted Trust where each story underscored the complexities of sex work during the conflict and how they extend beyond that historical moment to the present as women still engage in the commercial sex industry for their livelihood Some stories highlighted sexual violence and sexual impunity during the conflict some the impact of the conflict on women and their mental health some accounts were about childhood trauma of rape and its consequences some about empathy and kindness while others highlight how these women who are sole breadwinners of their families have taken control of the economic opportunities sex work offers Nobody perceives this as a decent job Everyone demeans it as indecent But my main priority is to raise my children said one of the women who wished to remain anonymous while being feature on a video that captures the lives of sex workers The Sex Workers and Allies South Asia SWASA network as per its peerreviewed Status Report of Sex Workers 2023 states that the average sex worker is a woman between 2650 years of age who generally belongs to the urban poor is a daily wage labourer is directly affected by the war or is connected to the rural farming community It is not about punishing these people for the only viable economic option that they have but to make it safer and if they still choose to get out of it to provide them ways in which they could get out of it without social recrimination Paba Deshapriya of The Grassrooted Trust Even though sex work is widespread in Sri Lanka sex workers are often arrested under the Vagrants Ordinance No 4 of 1841 This archaic law allows police to arrest without warrant every common prostitute wandering in the public street or highway or in any place of public resort and behaving in a riotous or indecent manner For the record sex work is criminalised in Sri Lanka The research identifies how sex workers who worked during and after the conflict are absent from the narratives of history Their experiences are hidden behind social stigma moral admonition and deliberate public silence Therefore this makes it difficult for this specific group of women to access compensation recognition accountability justice and other economic opportunities afforded to survivors of a conflict in a setting of transitional justice Women who shared their experiences during this project recollected how they had to remain low key in order to continue in their profession in a heavily securitised backdrop Lucrative profession Many women showcased in the study have been placed in these circumstances due to poverty war displacement the loss of a breadwinner or support system compounded by the desperation of providing for their children families Manjula a mother of one who is in her sixties and is from Puttalam recollected memories of a brutal past She is from a migrant fisher family and at the age of 19 or 20 she had eloped with a fisherman I lived with him But one day he packed his clothes and said hes going to work and never returned I was thrown into sex work and my clients were mostly army personnel and policemen We were afraid of the uniforms because they were in control Eventually I became pregnant and later found out that the father of my child was legally married and settled My parents thought I was doing a job but I was worried about my child I used to work at a shop but I only earned Rs 400700 daily But through this type of work I can earn about Rs 40006000 daily hence I thought of continuing as a sex worker Stories of women like Manjula elaborate on how the war had presented an opportunity for women to break out of their strictly defined social roles giving them the opportunity and agency to find more lucrative livelihoods These women view their choice to become sex workers as an act of courage My parents thought I was doing a job but I was worried about my child I used to work at a shop but I only earned Rs 400700 daily But through this type of work I can earn about Rs 40006000 daily hence I thought of continuing as a sex worker Manjula Sex workers are doing a serviceKamala Kamalas story reveals how some women engaged in sex work are courageous enough to emerge resilient and Pair of slippers kept as a memory reminds one sex worker about her first love The items have been documented by the Praja Diriya Foundation A sex worker has kept a Camouflage Tshirt worn by the father of her son to remind him that he has a father even though his name was not given for the birth certificate Birth control pills given to one woman who had hopes to marry her lover selfsufficient while enduring harassment and violence Kamala a mother of two and in her late forties is from a family of farmers from Hasalaka Kandy Having settled in Polonnaruwa many Sinhalese farmers couldnt engage in farming as LTTE terrorists would abduct and kill themThey would cut you down if they found that you were a Sinhalese recalled Kamala But my husband didnt want to endure the trauma and decided to return to my village and work as a wage labourer instead she said But one day Kamalas husband who had said he would visit the town never returned We tried to find him telegrammed everyone but to date there is no trace of him The government said that they would compensate widows but I havent received anything When I visited the police to lodge a complaint they took my number down and promised help But after my husband disappeared I had an affair with a policeman He would secretly visit me at home because back then my two children were small But later on I found out that he was already a family man Thereafter I stopped seeing him she said However Kamala recalled how she misunderstood peoples gestures Some shopkeepers gave me free food dry rations and I thought they were doing that out of pity as I was widowed But eventually they would ask me for sexual favours Since I didnt have money I engaged in sex work But after sometime I gave up People in my village respect me for who I am I keep guard at my paddy field during the night she said Kamala said that people shouldnt view sex workers in disgust Sex workers are doing a service We give a man what he doesnt get from home and he is happy at least momentarily I managed to educate my children built my own house and therefore I believe that I am courageous she added Building a context of sisterhood For this research the women were identified through regional associations of sex workers and peertopeer introductions if they were not part of any networks They shared their histories because they wanted these stories to add weight to their journey towards societal acceptance and equality before the law When asked how the researchers built the trust with the women to narrate their true life stories the projects lead researcher Hettiarachchi said that out of the 35 women about 2022 of them were associated in some way with the SWASA networkSo they may be part of regional organisations or small groups from Moneragala Puttalam etc but they are part of a larger movement leading them towards asking for few different things One such requirement is not to get arrested another one is about dignity of labour and another need is to not be penalised by using healthcare such as forcing them to do blood tests etc but to actually care for their wellbeing This association allows them a kind of sisterhood a kind of space to engage and get to know each other They have shared their stories and have built a trust over a period of time and thereafter we documented these cases said Hettiarachchi A call to decriminalise sex work The twoyear research underscores how these women havent been given an opportunity to speak about violations they have experienced as whatever that happened during the war is outside public witness Women also think that this is part of their job and they dont understand how much violence has permeated into their lives Hettiarachchi continued They dont come forward from a justice point of view because sex work is often being look through a criminalised mindset So the women themselves think they somewhat deserves this kind of violation and its something to be endured rather than challenged she said Although the research highlights stories from the past it connects to the present as these women still dont have access to the justice system and because of the way the law is being applied to sex work Most women who were interviewed for this project are still engaged in sex work hence this isnt their past as yet Therefore by linking them with the SWASA network they have been given a platform to amplify their voices a way to interpret one another and build a context of sisterhood Hettiarachchi added Decolonising the law The SWASA network is a movement comprising sex workers and their work in Sri Lanka has mainly been on decolonizing the legal system The Vagrants Ordinance is a colonial law on vagrants to keep people away from white people and it is now being applied to sex workers as well Sex workers dont need to be punished they are doing all this to feed their children added Paba Deshapriya of The Grassrooted Trust Sometimes when their children find out about this they kick their mothers out It is not about punishing these people for the only viable economic option that they have but to make it safer and if they still choose to get out of it to provide them ways in which they could get out of it without social recrimination said Deshapriya In 2020 when a brothel was raided and seven sex workers were produced before the court the judge ruled that sex work is not an offence if theyre engaging in it for a living The Vagrants Ordinance includes words such as indecent which were all drafted according to the Victorian eye said Deshapriya Deshapriya also spoke of how sex workers are being arrested while on their way home or while getting off the bus Our overall demand is to decriminalize sex work but until and unless the ordinance is repealed this demand will never see light of day said Deshapriya Sex workers demands Sex workers now demand the authorities to not arrest them under the Vagrants ordinance They say that nobody can ask them to plead guilty for soliciting sex work or for loitering or being indecent because they are doing a job The findings of the status report where we interviewed over 300 women indicate that over 50 of women are asked to plead guilty by either their lawyers or law enforcement officers This way they carry a criminal record but they were actually not loitering or soliciting or being indecent but were standing on the road in sex work The police for example need to accept that sex work is work and not go about beating sex workers said Deshapriya Sex workers are excluded from society to a point that sometimes they are reluctant to even obtain an ID for themselves The status report indicates that 70 of them havent applied to obtain these documents They dont go to the grama niladhari to inquire about these matters The small percentage of women who have applied for these documents admit that they have been asked for sexual favors in order to be on the list They dont get birth certificates for their children because they dont have a husband Once they say they dont have a husband they have to disclose what they do Thereafter they cannot send their children to school and its a cycle of violence because of the stigma around sex work As a result a lot of their rights are completely violated said Deshapriya The workers also recognize that their work is unsafe The status report lists out a number of threats which vary from the being killed to raped gangrated getting robbed their children seeing them parents walking into the room or to the house Most of the time their workplace is not safe for them explained Deshapriya Accepting sex work as another form of labour In 2017 the CEDAW committee in its concluding observations on Sri Lanka said that faced with the constant threat of criminal action sex workers in Sri Lanka are unable to benefit from Sri Lankas labour framework such as demanding safe and dignified working conditions or obtain social security benefits When asked if sex workers are willing to change their profession Deshapriya said that it had been a longstanding argument For them this is the only lucrative and viable mode of income There have been various projects done to provide sex workers with alternative jobs but they may not have skills to do other jobs said Deshapriya Many dont take to sex work as a choice but do out of necessity But when you consent to have sex work it doesnt mean your consent should be violated Their men may be disabled or have abandoned women with children Sex work is therefore a form of labour a form of work said Deshapriya However going forward the lead researchers of this project plan to work locally with grama niladhari officers and most importantly lawyers who can accompany sex workers to the government officers or to the police However theres a gap to be bridged and a lot of sensitization needs to happen at the ground level because that is where most challenges are Hence our next step is to have these conversations with the lawyers Deshapriya concluded As this writer walked past a camouflage Tshirt and a babys bonnet kept on display these items further highlighted the emotional trauma endured by sex workers The camouflage Tshirt is a memoir that a mother keeps to remind her son that he had a father He gave me a child but not his name for my sons birth certificate the display read while the babys bonnet is the only cherished memory of a sex worker who gave birth to a stillborn child Names of women have been withheld under conditions of privacy"

to the Department of Census and Statistics the number of new births has decreased by about 100000 compared to previous years Newly wedded couples opt for a marriage registration and utilise the money allocated for the wedding ceremony to immigrate Sources from the Department of Census and Statistics maintain that details about a decrease in marriage registrations have been concealed due to the fear that such information can impact upcoming elections The ongoing economic crisis in the country is not only impacting the availability of food but has also had a significant effect on population growth This is evident in the fact that the majority of individuals who married in the years 202120222023 are choosing not to have children according to data provided by the Department of Census and Statistics Consequently compared to previous years the number of new births has decreased by about 100000 According to newly married couples who chose not to have children in 2019 and 2020 the reason was the Covid epidemic Due to the vaccinations administered to control the epidemic they had to delay having children based on medical advice Even though the COVID epidemic has subsided newly married couples are showing reluctance to produce children citing the countrys economic crisis as the reason They say that raising children in a situation where they cannot afford living expenses adds an unnecessary burdenWe love children but we choose not to have our own Its a personal decision We entered wedded life getting in to debt and it will take at least six years to pay off the loan weve taken Currently we are renting a house and our income is insufficient to settle debts and pay for rent daily necessities and utility bills Additionally there are concerns about job security due to ongoing issues at the work place Weve decided not to raise a child to prevent jeopardizing their future amid this economic crisis The financial strain after childbirthwhich includes expenses for formula and other necessitiesposes a significant challenge Providing proper education for children under these circumstances is also a concern This is why we have chosen not to have children opined a newly married couple Some argue that love alone is not sufficient to bring children into the world They emphasise that their children would not receive a proper education in Sri Lanka Even families with just one child struggle to make ends meet with their monthly income The recent increase in VAT has elevated the cost of everything Additionally there are limited job opportunities for children who receive education in Sri Lanka Migration is becoming a common consideration We do not want our children to endure the hardships that we face even after obtaining an education Therefore we have decided against having children aired another couple sharing their views on marriage raising children Moreover many newlyweds and those on the verge of getting married aspire to migrate shortly after registering their marriage due to their inability to confront the economic crisis prevalent in the country They often opt for a marriage registration and utilise the money allocated for the wedding ceremony to move abroad In this scenario one of the partners typically goes abroad first and eventually brings his or her spouse over after some time The prospect of having children is not a priority in such circumstances as their future depends on the employment opportunities they secure overseas These individuals also refuse to have children despite getting married Another group says that their parents endured hardships on their behalf and now they find themselves grappling with the countrys economic challenges As a result they are refusing to have children because of the possibility that they will have to undergo hardships due to the prevailing economic situation Politicians and other authorities seem reluctant to acknowledge the fact that a significant number of newly married couples are refraining from having children Consequently certain officials express hesitation in releasing specific reports from the Department of Census and Statistics A department spokesperson confirmed that this reluctance is solely to prevent the emergence of another issue amid the economic crisis in the country The spokesperson of the Department of Census and Statistics added that there is a decrease in marriage registrations indicating a possible halt in marriages due to the ongoing economic challenges Additionally it was reported that data has been concealed due to the fear that if such issues surface especially with this years presidential and general elections approaching it will significantly impact the voter base of those in power Decrease in new births Although the release of the latest data from the Department of Census and Statistics has been delayed according to birth registration records covering the period July 2012 to June 2023 it appears that the number of new births has decreased by nearly 100000 From July 2012 to June 2013 352450 new births were registered for the year 2013 From July 2013 to June 2014 361800 new births were registered for the year 2014 From July 2014 to June 2015 342108 new births were registered for the year 2015 From July 2015 to June 2016 331525 new births were registered for the year 2016 From July 2016 to June 2017 322089 new births were registered for the year 2017 From July 2017 to June 2018 325741 new births were registered for the year 2018 From July 2018 to June 2019 329177 new births were recorded for the year 2019 From July 2019 to June 2020 299875 new births were registered for the year 2020 From July 2020 to June 2021 295418 new births were registered for the year 2021 From July 2021 to June 2022 289863 new births were registered for the year 2022 From July 2022 to June 2023 268920 new births were registered for the year 2023 Compared to data from 2013 there was a rapid decrease in the registration of new births in Sri Lanka in the year 2023 Compared to 2013 83530 new births have decreased in 2023 Compared to 2013 the registration of new births in 2022 has decreased by 62587 Compared to 2013 the birth registration in 2021 has decreased by 57032 It is also noteworthy that the majority of newly married individuals who do not have children are Sinhala Buddhists A Muslim youth recently married expressed his views stating that the Muslim community is also having fewer children due to the current economic crisis Traditionally Muslim families used to have about 35 children However considering the present economic challenges he mentioned that the number of children in their community has now been limited to 23 According to the latest World Bank data a family in Sri Lanka has limited the number of children to two Data obtained from the Family Health Bureau and the Sri Lanka Police indicate that the Child Protection Authority points out that there were 2087 teenage mothers reported in the year 2022 alone The authority shows that these pregnancies often resulted from instances of rape connected to intimate relationships or other circumstances That number is associated with 4 percent of the teenagers The police report also reveals that 1391 individuals who filed complaints of rape in this manner in 2022 became pregnant through consensual sexual activity However these teenagers who got pregnant were between the ages 1519 Additionally only onethird of abuses are reported to the Child Protection Authority and the police A spokeswoman of the Child Protection Authority confirmed that it is widely acknowledged that the actual number of rape cases is seven times higher than those officially reported even if not formally announced Sixteen children with disabilities are born every day in Sri Lanka as revealed in a 2020 survey conducted by the Department of Health The survey report also indicates that 5800 children are born with birth defects annually According to the report 16 children with birth defects are born every day Additionally based on data from the health department the number of foetuses dying in the womb after 7 months is about 1900 According to a recent report from 2016 the health sector has discovered that 650 illegal abortions are performed every day The health department reports also state that there are more than 240000 abortions done during a year The reason for this as pointed out by the health sector is that young people are increasingly adopting the concept of not getting married and living together Maintaining that it is difficult to have children in the face of COVID and economic crises they adopt the concept of unmarried cohabitation The various drugs and vaccines that these individuals take to prevent pregnancy have led to an increase in the birth of children with birth defects There is also a rise in abortions Therefore a spokesperson from the Department of Health emphasised that te responsible parties should pay attention to this trend Commenting on this issue Family Health Bureau Director Dr Chithramali de Silva stated that there is no significant increase in the rape of teenage girls The information we receive is the number of teenagers among pregnant mothers registered with Public Health Midwives There is no notable increase and the information covers the entirety of Sri Lanka In some areas however the percentage is higher Apart from that there is no significant increase To assert that newly married people are not having children we would need to conduct a survey as we currently lack the necessary data for that However the registration of new births is lower compared to previous years and there is a decline in marriages The COVID epidemic contributed to the decrease in new births said Dr De Silva She added that data provided by the Department of Census and Statistics suggests that most of the newly married couples are not raising children due to the current economic crisis If so this is another sad situation that this nation has to confront in the face of the economic crisis This country having a promising generation of children in the future will remain a dream given the present situation in the country Therefore Sri Lankans hope that the authorities will swiftly pay attention to all these issues and provide a solid solution"

conflicting interests overrode the desire for peace In Myanmar political and ethnic divisions are also exacerbated by foreign meddling This is why attempts to bring about lasting ceasefires and the resumption of talks to find solutions to the countrys underlying problems have invariably floundered The Myanmar military known as Tatmadaw has got used to ruling the country directly or indirectly from the 1960s onwards It is intolerant of elected governments and prodemocracy movements The majority community the Buddhist Bamar seeks democracy but only for itself not for the many ethnically different Christian and Muslim groups in the North and in areas bordering China and Bangladesh China has a deep interest in peace in Myanmar as it eyes the resource rich areas on its border with Myanmar It also has infrastructure projects there with plans for more While striving for the cessation of hostilities and the resumption of talks China does not want to alienate the Tatmadaw because the military is the most powerful and stable institution in Myanmar an institution that has also been traditionally proChinese China is alienated from the prodemocracy movement because that movement draws inspiration and moral support from the West with which China has a running feud To keep up its relevance in Myanmar and to prevent any one group from becoming too powerful China arms both the junta in Yangon and selected ethnic groups to keep them under its thumb As for the ethnic groups they are alienated from both the military and the majority Bamar including the prodemocracy agitators

in the North and East The Arakan Army widened operations in the Rakhine State bordering Bangladesh The military faced resistance in the Mon and Karen states and the Yangon and Tanintharyi regions as well West Doubts Chinas Intentions While China swears that it is nonpartisan western scholars like Morgan Michaels of the International Institute for Strategic Studies at the Johns Hopkins University feel that Beijings secret interest is in propping up the antiWestern junta and preventing the proWest democracy movement from coming to power Michaels says Chinas hidden agenda is to help the military junta withstand challenges from armed ethnic minorities as well as prodemocracy agitators Writing in the journal of the International Institute for Strategic Studies Michaels points out that the border areas are critical for China because they are rich in minerals China has infrastructural projects here under the Belt and Road Initiative BRI and it desires peace in this area mainly to serve its economic interests According to Michaels Beijings objective is to slow down the resistance movement so that the junta survives longer The junta is favoured because it has been consistently proChina and antiWest and has been dependent on China and Russia for arms In December 2022 Chinas new special envoy for Myanmar Deng Xijun met seven of Myanmars most powerful EAOs and told them that China would more actively enforce its policy against instability along the border and that the EAOs should distance themselves from the National Unity Government NUG an opposition body established by lawmakers ousted by the coup The NUG China said had become too close to the West Since then Chinese diplomats have been active setting up face to face talks between the military and the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee FPNCC of the EAOs The latter has been told to avoid the NUG and its armed subsidiary the Peoples Defence Forces PDFs Michaels says that this will only help the junta achieve its key strategic objectives which are to demilitarize the EAOs and the NUD and in turn help strengthen the junta and foster Beijings ties with it The Bamar who are leading the democracy movement in Manmar are seeking the support of the ethnic groups for their struggle telling the EAOs that solutions to their problems lie in the restoration of democracy that was crushed by the 2021 military coup If the EAOs and the PDF form a close alliance the junta will be in a soup It is already feeling the heat Following the coup some brigades from the Kachin Independence Army KIA and Karen National Union KNU launched direct offensives on the military They also gave the PDFs military training and arms and even accompanied them in ambushes and attacks But as Michaels says the Chinese do not want an EAOPDF alliance to blossom as it will weaken the junta The junta has adopted a carrot and stick policy of offering pauses in military operations and talks to amenable EAOs on the one hand and launching vicious attacks on the recalcitrant ones The junta may offer talks to the recalcitrant ones too under Chinese pressure but it will break the ceasefire at the first opportunity as it did last week The Chinese have also been adopting a carrot and stick policy visvis the junta They are fostering an ethnic group called Wu on the border with Myanmar In 2017 the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee FPNCC a coalition of seven ethnic armed organisations EAOs was formed to seek negotiations with the central government FPNCC is led by the United Wa State Army UWSA a group that maintains close ties with the Chinese Communist Party The UWSA controls a de facto statelet divided into two noncontiguous territories along the Chinese and Thai borders According to Michaels Wa leaders command an estimated 25000 troops equipped with weapons originating from China including FN6 ManPortable Air Defence Systems armoured vehicles and various light weapons The UWSA also assembles a version of the Chinese Type81 automatic rifle at a factory in its area of control While China has historically limited the Wa from transferring more capable weapons to other actors in Myanmar the UWSA has become the principal source of small arms and light weapons for its FPNCC allies The UWSA is also close with the National Democratic Alliance Army NDAA and the Shan State Progress Party SSPP Both the UWSA and NDAA are direct offshoots of the Communist Party of Burma CPB a former armed group which split up in 1989 Given their close relations with China and longstanding agreements with the military the UWSA NDAA and SSPP are all unlikely to seek a renewal of direct confrontation with the junta Michaels says They act as Chinas proxies influencing the other EAOs to change their line as per Chinas interests one of which is to keep the junta firmly in the saddle in Yangon"

        "body": "As of date the Tamil polity is in disarray with many parties and groups and leaders There is no such thing as unity or discipline or understanding even among the leaders of the ITAK The party looks like a camp with different tents its leaders have built for themselves with different agendas As political parties in the South gear up for the Presidential Election expected in September the election of a new leader for the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi ITAK known as the Federal Party in English has assumed great importance in Tamil politics The ITAK is holding the election today in Trincomalee ahead of the longdelayed convention of the party next Sunday In its almost 75year history the election of the ITAK leader has always been unanimous If its founder leader the illustrious SJV Chelvanayagam had wanted to he could have held the post of party leader for the rest of his life But after having served only once as party President he worked out an arrangement whereby party seniors from the Northern Province and the Eastern Province would alternate as President and General Secretary However in 1973 when former Member of Parliament for Vaddukkoddai in the North Appapillai Amirthalingam and the then Batticaloa MP Chelliah Rasadurai from the East were vying for the leadership Chelva persuaded Rasadurai to withdraw It is doubtful if Chelva would have been able to convince Amirthalingam to give up even if he wanted to give Rasadurai a chance In the 1970s after the Tamil United Liberation Front was formed by uniting various Tamil political parties no one talked about ITAK in the long turbulent period that followed the 1976 Vaddukkoddai Resolution Even with diminished influence the TULF continued to be the moderate political face of the Tamils during the civil war The Tamil National Alliance TNA formed in 2001 by reunifying Tamil parties first contested the December 2001 General Elections under the TULFs Rising Sun symbol Later due to differences with the leader of the TULF former MP Veerasingham Anandasangari over the Rising Sun symbol the TNA contested the April 2004 General Elections under the House symbol of the ITAK Thereafter the TNA contested all subsequent elections under the House symbol As the ITAK was the oldest of the constituent parties of the TNA and was the largest Tamil party with considerable support in the North and East and due to the fact that the alliance had been contesting consecutive elections under the House symbol the ITAK aspired to have a bigger say in Tamil politics The other member parties in the TNA especially leaders of exmilitant movements began to express displeasure over ITAKs continued bid for dominance Their constant call for the ITAK to register the TNA with the Election Commission under a separate symbol was ignored by ITAK leader R Sampanthan even though he was the leader of the TNA and its Parliamentary group Such contradictions eventually caused a rift in the TNA The leaders of the ITAK have an impression that other Tamil parties will not be able to win seats if they did not contest elections in alliance with the ITAK Some ITAK stalwarts also proposed that the TNA member parties could compete separately in the Local Government Elections scheduled to be held early last year and join forces to form local councils in the North and East based on the number of seats available after the results were announced Unable to accept this the other parties withdrew from the alliance and filed nominations as a separate front The Tamil parties saw the local polls as an opportunity to gauge their influence among the Tamil people But the elections were postponed indefinitely As of date the Tamil polity is in disarray with many parties and groups and leaders They do not know how many members are behind them There is no such thing as unity or discipline or understanding even among the leaders of the ITAK The party looks like a camp with different tents its leaders have built for themselves with different agendas It is in such a background that the excitement about the election for the new leader of the ITAK has to be viewed After Sampanthan veteran politician Mavai Senathrajah who was unanimously elected as the leader of the ITAK in 2014 has been holding the position for almost a decade The party convention had not been held for a long time The election for the leader is held today before the convention next week because it was not possible to choose someone in his place on the basis of consensus as per the tradition This is the first ever election for the leadership in the history of the ITAK Members of the General Council and Central Working Committee altogether numbering 325 are eligible voters MPs of the Jaffna district Mathiaparanam Sumanthiran Sivagnanam Sritharan and former Batticaloa district MP Seenithamby Yogeswaran are in the fray Among them Sumanthiran and Sritharan had entered Parliament at the same time Sumanthiran a President Counsel entered Parliament through the National List of the TNA after the April 2010 General Elections and then successfully contested from the Jaffna district in the August 2015 and August 2020 General Elections He has been a Member of Parliament for the past 14 years Sritharan a former principal of Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam contested from the Jaffna district in the 2010 2015 and 2020 General Elections as a TNA candidate and was elected to Parliament He also has 14 years of Parliamentary experience Yogeswaran successfully contested as a candidate of the TNA for the Batticaloa district in the 2010 and 2015 General Elections At the last General Election he was defeated Sumanthiran and Sritharan had announced in advance that the winner of the election is committed to working with each other in the interests of the party They assured they would not take any action that would cause divisions in the party At the same time Sumanthiran while addressing a meeting of ITAK members in the East recently said that he will turn 60 next month and will retire from politics when he reaches 65 As this is the case Sritharan met and talked to Sampanthan who came to Parliament last week after a long time The veteran leader insisted that the partys longheld tradition be preserved in selecting the new leader But currently he doesnt have the political strength to create a situation where the leader of the party can be elected by consensus in the General Council The partys Central Working Committee which met at his residence last week failed to get the three candidates to agree to elect a President unanimously Eventually the contestants were given a days time to meet and come to a conclusion as per Sumanthirans request They met at Sritharans residence in Madiwela near the Parliament complex but could not reach an agreement So the election is certain It was understood that Yogeswaran who had already announced his support to Sritharan said that he would request his supporters to vote for latter in the General Council Irrespective of the candidature the crucial question is how the winner will contribute to the collective responsibility of guiding Tamil politics in the current domestic and international situation Although it cannot be said that the ITAK is in a position in determining the course of Tamil politics entirely it has a great role than other Tamil parties It is therefore important to look at how effectively the party has handled that role since the end of the civil war Since there was no cohesive Tamil polity among the North and East Tamils the role of leading them automatically came to the TNA As the main member party of that Alliance an additional responsibility rested on the ITAK and its then leader Sampanthan It secured the historically important role of moving the decadeslong struggle for political rights of the Tamil people to the next stage in the new situation that had emerged after the war But the ITAK leaders were unable to handle the role in a pragmatic way Sri Lankan Tamils are in a predicament like never before in their political history The pressure or goodwill of the international community including India could not sway Sri Lankan governments Many Tamil politicians and observers were hopeful that the geopolitical situation would turn out to be an opportunity for the Tamils but that was not to be Even India which facilitated the introduction of the provincial councils through the July 1987 Peace Accord has so far failed to ensure that Sri Lankan governments would implement the 13 amendment to the Constitution passed 36 years ago It must be admitted that Tamil politicians and militants had also contributed greatly to that failure by their irresponsible actions Although many resolutions have been passed in the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva regarding the alleged rights violations that occurred at the end of the civil war there is no possibility of getting justice for the Tamils in the foreseeable future But Tamil politicians continue to rely on the international community For the Sri Lankan Sinhalese polity the Tamil problem does not seem to require a political solution that fulfils even the minimal legitimate political aspirations of the Tamils Tamil political parties are not in a position to exert any pressure on the government or the political forces in the South The Tamil people are not ready to believe Tamil parties anymore and join in any protest organised by them These parties are unable to organise a small human chain campaign successfully Some Tamil politicians are keen on making the people live in the past Although they are not going to take up arms they keep talking about the past armed conflict propagating extremist views without any idea about how to go forward Many a Tamil politician is under the influence of the agenda of groups with extremist views in the Tamil Diaspora It is no secret that many of them can be manipulated by foreign forces Tamil politicians do not have the acumen to chart a viable path based on lessons that could be learned from the past bitter experiences They are spending most of their time in inter and intra party rivalries These are important issues that a new leader of the ITAK should address The politics of the old ITAK do not need a new leader What the Tamil people urgently need today is a new vision for the future not activities that keep them emotionally tied to the past Finally it is noteworthy that the leaders of the other Tamil parties are very concerned about who should not win the ITAK election for reasons that can be easily seen by any keen observer of Sri Lankan Tamil politics"

midst of insanity should not our best representatives retain sanity and bravely prevent a wreck of the ship of state under their care Observing two reports detailing reckless activities linked to the devil and the deep blue sea where the SL Navy is conducting surveillance on international seas and a group of ruling MPs are having a lavish party on board a ship in the port we had to slightly alter the title of the renowned creation by Nobel laureate tall and handsome author Ernest Hemingway who at 51 in 1951 finalized his magnum opus The Old Man and the Sea Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa brought up both of the aforementioned issues in Parliament showcasing his unwavering commitment to exposing any misconduct within the government ranks His dedication to scrutinizing the actions of the government is evident as he leaves no stone unturned in holding them accountable He emphasized the need to scrutinize the proposed Red Sea deployment in light of the dismal state of the economy exacerbated by the recent increase and expansion of VAT Why were only SLPP members present during the East and West Terminal inspection drama If invited MPs from various parties would have shared a scotch with the Rajapaksas and sang to the music of the live band and perhaps prevented the next days Parliamentary uproar The band should have played Nearer My God to Thee drawing a parallel to the final piece the Titanic band played on the ballroom deck of the ship which struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank with 1500 passengers in 1912 The exclusive event with only SLPP members having a picnic on board raises transparency concerns The public may not be as naive as State Minister Premalal believes The presence of politicians on board brings to mind highlevel meetings during the mass uprising in August 1953 Hartal A panicstricken Prime Minister his UNP Cabinet and senior public officers sought refuge on the British Warship HMS Newfoundland docked at the Colombo port Attacks by Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial vessels in the BabelMandeb Strait between the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa since late November have prompted major shipping companies to temporarily halt shipments introducing the potential for a significant impact on the global economy Ships are rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope adding thousands of miles causing a surge in shipment costs from Asia to Europe This situation raises concerns about the possibility of a renewed inflationary shock for the world economy This development comes in response to Israels bombardments of Gaza that killed 23000 civilians onethird children another onethird women which have escalated in the past week In response to a recent attack by militants on a vessel owned by Maersk helicopters launched from US Navy warships were deployed to repel the assault over the weekend The Sri Lankan Navy is already conducting surveillance in international seas State Minister of Defence Pramitha Tennekoon said in Parliament in reply to Premadasa We are already affected by the situation in the Red Sea Ships have been forced to come past South Africa because of the threats posed by the Houthi terror group Prices of imported essential items are going up as a result The Colombo Port has to ensure container transshipment and the safety of vessels Supplies will end up in SL if shipping lines are blocked The consequences can be terrible The Red Sea is heavily used by commercial shipping companies It will definitely affect the supply chain Despite a surge in transshipment volumes at the Colombo Port due to major shipping lines rerouting vessels around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid Red Sea disruptions industry sources caution that this is a shortterm benefit This trend is seen as a temporary transit point until the Red Sea situation stabilizes The Red Sea crisis may result in a loss of transshipment volumes impacting the supply chain Shipping lines operating on shortterm plans may skip calling at Colombo one week but reconsider based on cargo availability in the next Freight rates are increasing with a 30 percent hike announced from January 15 This situation affecting commercial shipping in the Red Sea poses a potential longterm challenge for the Port of Colombo and disrupts the broader supply chain The overall tone reflects a complex and dynamic political landscape with internal party conflicts requiring strategic maneuvers No one is isolated everyone is connected to the larger whole If a piece is lost the entire entity is affected Whether its a person or a part of the world any loss diminishes us because we are all part of humanity So never ask for whom the bell tolls it tolls for you There seem to be issues growing out of the controversial decision by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to deploy a Sri Lankan naval vessel in the Red Sea ostensibly to help manage lawandorder in the region Critics of the administrations move are right when they take up the position that Sri Lanka should keep out of the USled seemingly antiterrorism naval operation in the Red Sea Simply put this is not small Sri Lankas war Nor is there anything much in it for Sri Lanka Does it appear that we offering to assist the West in managing terrorrelated issues is primarily an attempt to aid Western interests Will this movement put Sri Lankas neutrality at risk along with its neutral credentials in a potential regional conflict that seems to be escalating beyond the Middle East The US and UK have conducted strikes on targets in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi attacks including the use of antiship ballistic missiles for the first time The strikes received support from Australia Bahrain Canada and The Netherlands but not from the nuclear power France Yemeni Houthis escalated tensions with the US and UK in response to retaliatory strikes Western companies feel the supply chain impact and so do Indians Back home facing challenges in collecting direct taxes we impose additional burdens effortlessly on indirect taxpayers Is there an alternative At the risk of losing monumental support Mahatma Gandhi famously questioned No cabinet worthy of being representative of a large mass of mankind can afford to take any step merely because it is likely to win the hasty applause of an unthinking public In the midst of insanity should not our best representatives retain sanity and bravely prevent a wreck of the ship of state under their care Unlike some politicians who oppose anything others who have genuine concerns have also raised the issue It is essential to note that any disaster faced by a nation or disruptions in the smooth flow of trade and economic progress in any part of the globe in this era of unwavering recognition of the global village concept will certainly affect us as well It is our primary duty to contribute in whichever way possible to safeguard the security and wellbeing of human lives irrespective of their nationality Thats why Hemingway copied 17th century poet and philosopher John Donnes line For whom the bell tolls as his third novels title in 1940 In 1624 Donne wrote No one is isolated everyone is connected to the larger whole If a piece is lost the entire entity is affected Whether its a person or a part of the world any loss diminishes us because we are all part of humanity So never ask for whom the bell tolls it tolls for you However the President must reconsider the decision for our own interest kksperera1gmailcom"

Antarctic Treaty first signed on December 1 1959 designates Antarctica as a continent devoted to peace and science Antarctica the southernmost and the leastpopulated continent on Earth is home to some of the worlds most spectacular natural wonders However it is also one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change As the global temperatures continue to rise the impact on Antarctica and its surrounding oceans are profound Antarctica is situated almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean also known as the Antarctic Ocean it contains the geographic South Pole Antarctica is the fifthlargest continent being about 40 larger than Europe and has an area of 14200000 square kilometres 5500000 square miles Most of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet with an average thickness of 19 km 12 mi Antarctica is approximately some 8000 km south of Sri Lanka The Antarctic ice sheet is one of the two polar ice caps of Earth It covers about 98 of the Antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on Earth with an average thickness of over 2 kilometres Separate to the Antarctic sea ice it covers an area of almost 14 million square kilometres 54 million square miles and contains 265 million cubic kilometres 6400000 cubic miles of ice A cubic kilometre of ice weighs approximately 092 metric gigatons meaning that the ice sheet weighs about 24380000 gigatons A gigaton is a billion metric tons and a metric ton equals 2205 pounds It holds approximately 61 of all fresh water on Earth equivalent to about 58 metres of sea level rise if all the ice were above sea level In East Antarctica the ice sheet rests on a major land mass while in West Antarctica the bed can extend to more than 2500m below sea level Satellite measurements by NASA indicate a still increasing sheet thickness above the continent outweighing the losses at the edge The reasons for this are not fully understood but studies include the climatic effects on ocean and atmospheric circulation of the ozone hole andor cooler ocean surface temperatures as the warming deep waters melt the ice shelves The ozone hole is not technically a hole where no ozone is present but is actually a region of exceptionally depleted ozone in the stratosphere over the Antarctic that happens at the beginning of Southern Hemisphere spring AugustOctober Satellite instruments provide us with daily images of ozone over the Antarctic region Ownership of Antarctica There is no single country that owns Antarctica Instead Antarctica is governed by a group of nations in a unique international partnership The Antarctic Treaty first signed on December 1 1959 designates Antarctica as a continent devoted to peace and science In addition there are no cities in Antarctica However many countries have established research stations and bases across the Antarctic continent Many of the stations were established for both scientific purposes as well as to attempt to stake territorial claims Seven countries Argentina Australia Chile France New Zealand Norway and the United Kingdom maintain territorial claims in Antarctica but the United States and most other countries do not recognize those claims While the United States maintains a basis to claim territory in Antarctica it has not made a claim In 1821 Captain John Davis from the United States is believed to have set foot in Antarctica for the first time Ever since then its been a race to get to the geographic South Pole In 1909 the British explorer Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton set out on an expedition to reach out to the Geographic South Pole Unfortunately due to safety concerns he and his team were forced to turn back 180 km from the Geographic South Pole In 1911 a second British explorer Robert Falcon Scott set out to reach the Geographic South Pole Unfortunately when he and his team got there a Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and his team had already got to the Geographic South Pole 34 days before making the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen the first man to reach the Geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911 Population of Antarctica The continent has a population of around 5000 people but during the winter this number is reduced to approximately a fourth with 1000 people The inhabitants are mainly based at research stations with the McMurdo Station being the largest The McMurdo Station is an American Antarctic research station on the south tip of Ross Island which is in the New Zealandclaimed Ross Dependency on the shore of McMurdo Sound in Antarctica It is operated by the United States through the United States Antarctic Program a branch of the National Science Foundation Southern Ocean The Southern Ocean also known as the Antarctic Ocean comprises the southernmost waters of the world ocean generally taken to be south of 60 degrees south latitude and encircling Antarctica With a size of 20327000 km2 7848000 sq mi it is regarded as the secondsmallest of the five principal oceanic divisions smaller than the Pacific Atlantic and Indian oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean Since the 1980s the Southern Ocean has been subject to rapid climate change which has led to changes in the marine ecosystem The Southern Ocean geologically the youngest of the oceans was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart opening the Drake Passage roughly 30 million years ago The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current With a northern limit at 60 degrees south latitude the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary the northern boundary does not edge a landmass Instead the northern limit is with the Atlantic Indian and Pacific Oceans One reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica Water in the Southern Ocean south of for example New Zealand resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean Why is Antarcticas Ice Important Antarctic ice also plays a critical role in regulating the Earths climate It reflects the suns heat provides a habitat for microscopic plants that absorb carbon controls global sea levels and generates cold salty water that helps drive global ocean currents The Activities that Threaten the Sustainability of Antarctica Tourism The number of tourists has increased substantially over the last 15 years In 1992 the number of tourists landing on Antarctica was 6704 whereas in 20089 it was over 27000 This increase in tourists may cause impacts on the environment such as trampling of vegetation disturbing wildlife and introduction of alien species in localized sites The vast majority of the Antarctic continent and outlying islands has not been visited by tourists but there may be pressure on commercial operators to find new sites Mining Mining is banned indefinitely with a provision for review in 2048 onwards in Antarctica under the Environmental Protocol However there are deposits of minerals on Antarctica that could be exploited including oil coal and iron ore In addition to the fact that such activity is prohibited exploiting minerals on and around Antarctica would be very expensive due to the thick ice inaccessibility due to Antarcticas remoteness and the very harsh climate Fishing Exploitation of the marine life in the Southern Ocean is carefully managed and protected by CCAMLR Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources However despite conservation measures Illegal Unregulated and Unreported IUU fishing continues which threatens to undermine conservation efforts Further action will probably require worldwide consumer boycotts of unsustainably caught fish in the Southern Ocean and engagement with landing ports around the Southern Ocean Bioprospecting Antarctica has a unique biodiversity that has begun to interest companies and bioprospectors Bioprospecting is the systematic search for biochemical and genetic information in nature in order to develop commerciallyvaluable products for pharmaceutical agricultural cosmetic and other applications Antarctica is of particular interest because little is known about Antarctic biota and secondly because of the extremes of environment including temperature aridity and salinity mean that biota will have evolved unique characteristics for survival that could be used to produce commercial products Antifreeze glycoproteins found in some species of Antarctic fish which stop them freezing could be used to improve fish farm production in cold climates extend the shelflife of frozen food and improve the preservation of transplanted tissue It was first discussed within the Antarctic Treaty System in 2002 Since then it has been discussed by SCAR Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research CEP Committee for Environmental Protection ATCM Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting Bioprospecting has the advantage of being quite a sustainable use of resources as generally very small samples are required for scientific research meaning that the environmental impact can remain quite small As there are a limited number of people conducting activities in Antarctica it makes it much easier to monitor bioprospecting activities in situ although tracking and regulating such genetic resources outside of the Antarctic is much more difficult In addition bioprospecting could result in increased funding for basic Antarctic research Obviously any bioprospecting which involved harvesting of species could have adverse environmental impacts Sri Lankan Dinuka Karunaratnes experience Sri Lankan Dinuka Karunaratne recounts his experience and insights to the arduous

world warms up at a rate dictated by current policies we will see the Antarctic system start to get away from us In the next 50 years melting Antarctic ice is predicted to cause rapid slowdown of deep ocean currents by 2050 Melting ice around Antarctica will cause a rapid slowdown of a major global deep ocean current by 2050 that could alter the worlds climate for centuries and accelerate sea level rise according to scientists behind new research Optimism We need to reflect on a positive and proactive approach toward Antarctica and its significance for the global ecosystem Optimism and collective efforts are key in addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with Antarctica By fostering scientific research promoting international cooperation and implementing sustainable practices there is hope that we cannot only preserve Antarcticas unique environment but also contribute to a healthier and more balanced planet As individuals communities and nations we need to work together there is great potential to make a positive impact on the future of Antarctica and by extension the Earths climate system Embracing optimism while taking responsible and informed actions can

January One of the three candidates Yoheswaran has thrown in his lot with another candidate Shritharan The election will therefore be a duel between Sumanthiran and Shritharan The fate of the ITAK Presidential election will greatly determine the future course of Tamil politics in Sri Lanka The nomination procedure requires a minimum of six members of the Central Working Committee to propose a name with the prospective candidates consent In this instance Sumanthirans name was proposed by twelve persons while Shritharan and Yoheswaran were nominated by six persons each They were from the Kilinochchi and Batticaloa districts respectively Sumanthiran was nominated by four persons from the Jaffna district and one each from the Kilinochchi Mannar Mullaitheevu Vavuniya Trincomalee

contested the 2020 polls but was not elected Suma Shri and Yohes in Triangular Contest for ITAKFP Leadership was the heading of my article published in the Daily Mirror of 16 December 2024 The article was about the forthcoming election for the party Presidency of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi ITAK The ITAK known as the Federal Party FP in English is the premier political party of the Northern and Eastern Tamils of Sri Lanka Currently the ITAKFP has six MPs in Parliament representing the two Northern and three Eastern electoral districts As stated earlier the ITAKs long delayed party convention is scheduled for January 27 and 28 this year in Trincomalee A crucial change of leadership is on the cards as the current ITAK President Somasuntharam Senathirajah known as Maavai is on the verge of compulsory retirement Maavai has been ITAK President since 2014 Hence a new President will be elected one week before the convention at a combined meeting of the ITAK Podhu Sabhai General Council and Mathiya Seyal Kuzhu Central Working Committee to be held on 21 January in Trincomalee Around 325 persons from the General Council and 50 from the Central Working Committee will elect the new party President Voting is by secret ballot Voting by proxy is not allowed Three contenders are in the fray for the ITAK Presidency The three aspirants to the ITAK leadership mantle are Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran Sivagnanam Shritharan and Seenithamby Yoheswaran As is well known Sumanthiran and Shritharan are both Jaffna district MPs while Yogeswaran is a former Batticaloa district Parliamentarian The eldest of the competing trio M A Sumanthiran was born in 1964 and is a lawyer by profession He was first appointed as a National List MP in 2010 Subsequently he was elected to Parliament from the Jaffna district in the 2015 and 2020 elections S Shritharan was born in 1968 He is a former teacher and school principal Shritharan was elected successively to Parliament from the Jaffna district in the 2010 2015 and 2020 elections The youngest of the trio is S Yoheswaran born in 1970 Yoheswarans vocationprofession is social service Yoheswaran was elected from the Batticaloa district to Parliament in 2010 and 2015 He contested the 2020 polls but was not elected The nomination procedure requires a minimum of six members of the Central Working Committee to propose a name with the prospective candidates consent In this instance Sumanthirans name was proposed by twelve persons while Shritharan and Yoheswaran were nominated by six persons each They were from the Kilinochchi and Batticaloa districts respectively Sumanthiran was nominated by four persons from the Jaffna district and one each from the Kilinochchi Mannar Mullaitheevu Vavuniya Trincomalee Batticaloa Amparai and Colombo districts respectively First for the ITAK The election to the party President post is a first for the ITAK Though the party constitution states an election must be held if there are two or more candidates there has never been a Presidential election in the ITAKs 74year history The partys cofounder and respected leader Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvanayagam venerated by his followers as Thanthai Chelva adopted the practice of selecting a leader through a consensus among senior leaders and obtaining approval from the rank and file at the party convention An election of a President for the first time therefore is a refreshing feature as it strengthens innerparty democracy However there were many within and outside the ITAK who feared that a competitive election could result in the party breaking up These worries were compounded by the veiled threats issued on behalf of a potential candidate by his supporters that their man would form a new party or join another party if he was not elected President There was concern that the party would be divided This writer too had some concerns about an election I felt that under prevailing circumstances the holding of a Presidential election could encourage fissiparous tendencies within the party and ultimately lead to fragmentation The party could suffer a serious split Besides an election could create an opening for extraneous intervention by the global Tamil Diaspora elements in India and the Sri Lankan deep state As such I urged wellintentioned ITAK stalwarts and wellwishers to intervene and bring about a compromise among the candidates thereby avoiding an election I called upon ITAK leaders like Sampanthan Maavai Senathirajah CVK Sivagnanam and Kurukularajah to work positively and constructively in this regard The Daily Mirror article was translated into Tamil and published in Tamil newspapers The feedback I received indicated that my viewpoint had struck a responsive chord in some ITAK members supporters and wellwishers Initially there were reports of the ITAKs emeritus leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan writing a letter to current ITAK President Maavai Senathirajah about the ITAK Presidential election The nonagenarian Trincomalee district MP does not hold any post in the ITAK now but is respectfully referred to as Perunthalaiver Great Leader by the Tamil media The octogenarian Maavai Senathirajah who was Jaffna district MP for almost two decades lost in 2020 and is no more an MP Maavai Senathirajah Maavai Senathirajah has clung on to the ITAK Presidency for nine years despite calls by many to relinquish his post and enable new leaders to take over When Sampanthan became ITAK President in 2010 he served for two twoyear terms and let Senathirajah who was then the General Secretary become President in 2014 Senathirajah who should have stepped down gracefully in 2018 did not do so Instead he has hung on to the Presidency by hook or by crook The ITAK party convention was not held for several years so as to avert the advent of a new President Finally overwhelming pressure from the party rank and file compelled Senathirajah to comply with the demand for a party convention When it became clear that there was going to be an election some had genuine concerns about a party split as a result Maavai then suggested that he should continue further as President instead of having an election This was rejected by the party Moreover the rival candidates themselves united on this issue and reiterated the call for an election Under these circumstances Sampanthans letter provided Maavai with another opportunity to remain in office as ITAK President Sampanthan piqued with some ITAK party men in Trincomalee alleged that elections for branch leadership posts in the district had not been done properly Sampanthans troubles with the ITAK in Trinco may be discussed in detail in a future article As such he wanted the present branches to be dissolved and urged that the party convention should not be held until then Politbureau Meeting Maavai utilised Sampanthans demand to his advantage He suggested that the ITAK Convention be postponed indefinitely until Sampanthans grievances were redressed Until then he Senathirajah would continue to be the ITAKs pro tem President An ITAK Politbureau meeting was convened at Sampanthans Colombo residence on January 10 to discuss the issue Meanwhile ExMP Yoheswaran openly aligned with Shritharan and extended support to him in the ITAK Presidential hustings This made the election a duel between Sumanthiran and Shritharan When the ITAK Politbureau met on January 10 Senathirajah was in for a surprise Although the Politbureau meeting had been convened to discuss matters like Sampanthans letter of complaint against the ITAK Trinco branches postponing of the Convention and endorsing Maavai as pro tem ITAK President those did not happen Sampanthan pointedly refrained from discussing the Trincomalee branch issue Therefore the matters of postponing the convention and appointing a pro tem President were not taken up for discussion What Maavai did not know was that three concerned individuals all of them lawyers had visited Sampanthan at different times prior to the Politbureau meeting and discussed Sampanthans grievances The Perunthalaiver was satisfied and a compromise arrived at As a result Sampanthan did not follow up his letter of complaint The Politbureau therefore confirmed that the convention would take place The party Presidential election would also be held Nevertheless some felt that an election should be averted and the party tradition of electing a President through a consensus should be continued Sampanthan too expressed the same sentiments It appeared that most members of the Politbureau wanted the candidates to arrive at an understanding and do away with an election This placed the two main contenders in a delicate position What was to be done Madhiwela Meeting Sumanthiran then stated that he was prepared to discuss the matter the next day and possibly reach an understanding if Shritharan and Yoheswaran were willing Both Shri and Yohes agreed Sumanthiran then suggested that all three of them meet the following day and arrive at a compromise if possible There was agreement and it was decided that Sumanthiran would meet with Shritharan at the latters residence in Madiwela Yoheswaran was also staying there SumanthiranShritharan Talks The meeting took place on January 11th morning at Madiwela Sumanthiran began the talks by saying let us discuss this matter in deference to the wishes of the Politbureau and reach a settlement Shritharan cut to the chase immediately by asking Sumanthiran to withdraw and let him Shri become President He would quit in two years and let Sumanthiran be President Taken aback by this blunt request Sumanthiran asked Shritharan why he was making this demand Shritharan replied in Tamil You once said that you will work with me as party leader Sumanthiran then refreshed Shritharans memory by referring to the context in which he reportedly said this You had announced that you Shritharan were ready to take up the leadership of the ITAK The media asked me what my response was to your statement I replied that I would be prepared to work under you if the party elected you as President Subsequently you apologized to Senathirajah for making such a statement and declared that you wont be interested in a leadership position for five years Sumanthiran reminded Shritharan Sumanthiran pointed out that Shritharan had not been elected President and therefore the question of working under him did not arise At this point Shritharan asked Sumanthiran why he wanted to be the ITAK President Why cant you let me be President this time and take over after me asked Shri He also reiterated that the ITAK Presidency could be shared by both on a rotational basis of two years each Sumanthiran responded by saying that he was not interested in being President on a rotational basis He said that the Tamil people were facing a huge crisis at present It was the ITAK that could provide positive leadership at this juncture The party needed both change and continuity Change and Continuity The Presidents Counsel PC pointed out that he could provide both change and continuity as he had been involved in every major political initiative undertaken by the ITAK concerning the Tamil national question He had participated in negotiations and discussions nationally and internationally He was in contact with many international leaders and officials He had also handled legal matters in a number of issues affecting Tamils Besides he had good relations with a number of political leaders from different parties Speaking further PC Sumanthiran said that on the strength of his background and experience he was confident of leading the ITAK successfully in the near future He said that with the support of the party he hoped to accomplish several things for the benefit of the Tamil people during his tenure Sumanthiran also said that he had publicly announced that he would retire from politics when he reached 65 years and that he would be 60 next February Therefore he was not going to be President for a long time 20 Minutes Discussion The third candidate Yoheswaran was a silent listener to the conversation At this juncture Yoheswaran got up and prepared to leave Shritharan then said let the election take place and ended the discussion Sumanthiran left The discussion did not take more than 20 minutes Consequently both Sumanthiran and Shritharan spoke to Tamil media outlets and said that the party would elect the new President The stage therefore is set for the ITAK Presidential election on 21st January One of the three candidates Yoheswaran has thrown in his lot with another candidate Shritharan The election will therefore be a duel between Sumanthiran and Shritharan The fate of the ITAK Presidential election will greatly determine the future course of Tamil politics in Sri Lanka An Apology and Explanation Let me conclude with an apology and explanation I had started writing a three part article on the topic Whither the IlankaithThamizhar of Sri Lanka The first part was published last week in the Daily Mirror I was astounded by the response to it I have been receiving many Emails FB messages and telephone calls Several people have sent me their views and input What is most satisfying is the fact that much of these responses are from the Sinhalese including political leaders academics bureaucrats and professionals I am in the process of analyzing this feedback and interacting with the senders of the responses This requires time and energy As such I will not be writing the second and third parts of the article My apologies to the readers Instead I will be writing a series of articles on the same theme They will be published intermittently in the coming weeks

        "body": "Also the government has published another bill titled Commission for Truth Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka in the government gazette on January 1 this year The idea for this commission was also mooted in 2015 under the premiership of President Wickremesinghe Nearly 15 years after the end of the separatist war the government has taken steps to promulgate a law last Tuesday enabling the establishment of an Office of National Unity and Reconciliation ONUR The office is not entirely a new entity but a reestablishment through an Act of Parliament of an entity that has been in operation under the same name since 2015 Despite it having been passed with the backing of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP it was President Ranil Wickremesinghe who has been instrumental in rejuvenating the office of reconciliation It was also Mr Wickremesinghe who as the then Prime Minister established the previous ONUR chaired by former President Chandrika Kumarathunge in 2015 Also the government has published another bill titled Commission for Truth Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka in the government gazette on January 1 this year The idea for this commission was also mooted in 2015 under the premiership of Mr Wickremesinghe during the socalled Yahapalana Government The then Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera gave a commitment to the United Nations Human Rights Council UNHRC not once but twice in 2015 and 2017 to establish such a Commission But it did not materialize for reasons known only to those who were behind the move The governments irrespective of the political party in office would make some important announcement with some relevance to the ethnic problem and human rights when the regular session of the UNHRC approaches in March almost each year For instance Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told the worlds human rights body in February 2020 that the government would appoint a commission to review the recommendations of past commissions on human rights issues and make fresh recommendations to implement what can be implemented However the government did not keep to that pledge until January 2021 when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed the Nawaz Commission when another UNHRC session was around the corner Similarly the Cabinet of Ministers approved a concept of a Truth and Reconciliation mechanism in January last year Yet the commission did not see the light of day but a bill to that effect was published in the gazette on January 1 this year Despite the professed purpose of these commissions committees and offices with regard to human rights and reconciliation giving a guarantee of future security to the Tamil people who bore the brunt of the threedecade long war Tamil parties voted against the ONUR Bill on Tuesday The reason they had cited was their lack of trust on the commitments pertaining to human rights and reconciliation given by the successive governments The plethora of commissions committees and offices that were established in the past attest to their point Although the history of commissions on human rights goes at least back to the commission on missing persons appointed by former President Ranasinghe Premadasa in the early 1990s the commissions and committees appointed since the tail end of the war drew more international attention In fact the very cause for those commissions to be appointed was heavy international pressure and not any genuine interest on the part of the governments of the day to ascertain who really violated human rights Subsequent to serious allegations of human rights violations against the armed forces and the LTTE former President Mahinda Rajapaksa within the first year of his Presidency initiated two investigative processes one a domestic commission and the other a committee of international experts The commission headed by Supreme Court Judge Nissanka Udalagama was assigned to investigate 15 serious incidents which are still being considered by the UNHRC as emblematic cases while the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons IIGEP was formed under the former Indian Chief Justice PN Bhagawati to oversee the work of the Udalagama Commission However the IIGEP ceased its operations two years later in March 2008 citing lack of political will on the part of the government Rajapaksa also appointed the All Party Representative Committee APRC under the Chairmanship of Professor Tissa Vitharana to find a solution to ethnic problem When the commitments in the joint communiqu issued by the then UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa a week after the end of the war in May 2009 were ignored by the Sri Lankan government the UN Secretary General appointed a panel of experts in 2010 to advise him on Sri Lankas human rights situation Former President Rajapaksa then appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission LLRC to counter that move in the same year As the LLRC report was also met with the same fate as those of previous commissions the USsponsored first resolution was adopted by the UNHRC in 2012 calling for Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of its own commission the LLRC However with the rejection of that resolution and the subsequent ones by Sri Lanka the latest resolutions provide for prosecution of those Sri Lankan military and political leaders who are being accused of human rights violations and war crimes Following the second US backed UNHRC resolution former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed the Paranagama Commission in August 2013 to look into the complaints of missing persons during the war The commission received over 19000 complaints and the report of it was handed over to the Presidential Secretariat in 2016 It was against this backdrop President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed the Nawaz Commission to review the reports of past commissions The process to find the missing persons was continued by the Office of Missing Persons OMP established by the Yahapalana Government which under the Premiership of Ranil Wickremesinghe initiated several other entities as well to bring in reconciliation The Office of Reparation OR The ONUR under Ms Kumaratunga The Secretariat for Coordinating the Reconciliation Mechanisms SCRM and The Consultations Task Force CTF under the SCRM were the most important among them There was also a plan to appoint a Truth Commission Interestingly nobody questioned if we needed such a lot of mechanisms with overlapping mandates to bring in reconciliation Similarly now the current government under President Wickremesinghe has also passed the ONUR Act and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is on the cards while the OMP and the OR are also functioning Also the final report of the Nawaz Commission is said to be handed over to the President soon In the meantime the President has pledged to the Tamil leaders during a recent discussion that a new Constitution would be introduced within a year after the next Parliamentary election through which a lasting solution to the ethnic problem would be found How complicated the things are The frustration among the Tamil leaders against this backdrop is sometimes manifested in the form of extreme statements TELO leader Selvam Adaikkalanathan told a gathering in Batticaloa in October last year that he sometimes regretted the laying down of arms in 1987 and felt like taking to arms again ITAK Parliamentarian Govindan Karunakaram questioned in Parliament how Tamils would forsake the dream of Tamil Eelam amidst the governments inaction towards the problems faced by his community However in spite of the Tamil leaders having been left without options under these circumstances and bitter rivalries among Tamil political parties it is dangerous to invite the past horrendous times again even out of frustration"

been severely undermined due to its economic bankruptcy has little freedom or external sovereignty to take a principled stance concerning the Palestinian cause States are expected to be lawabiding and uphold global justice They must desist from committing crimes against humanity or being complicit in crimes against humanity But in practice most states act like ruffians showing scant respect for the laws of warfare and international humanitarian laws In Gaza international laws and international humanitarian laws are being violated with such impunity that one wonders whether genocide is the new norm in dealing with international disputes What is worse the United States the socalled champion of a rulesbased international order has become the biggest accomplice in Israels genocide in Gaza as it blankly refuses to even make a mild request to Israel calling for a ceasefire One may say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the United States to enter the moralitybased political sphere Not only does the US adopt a morally reprehensible policy that has encouraged Israels genocide in Gaza but it is also known to pressurise less powerful states to toe its proIsraeli line A case in point was its efforts to armtwist several nations ahead of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 which partitioned Palestine in 1947 The resolution would not have found its passage if the US had not exerted undue economic threats and political pressure on countries such as Haiti Liberia and the Philippines which wanted to vote against the resolution Sri Lanka is under pressure from the US to abandon the Palestinian cause it has been championing since independence especially during the heydays of the NonAligned Movement Also adding pressure on Sri Lanka is it is believed India which has embraced Israel with warts war crimes and all This was evident in President Ranil Wickremesinghes speech to the UN General Assembly last year He desisted from making a declaration supporting the Palestinians aspiration for freedom thus veering away from the tradition almost all Sri Lankan leaders had followed In Sri Lankas postindependence political history two leaders stand out for defying US pressure Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Ranasinghe Premadasa Ms Bandaranaikes proPalestinian policy was so solid that she became a household name in the Middle East It was her proPalestinian policy that opened the Middle Eastern job market to Sri Lanka Sri Lanka is indebted to Ms Bandaranaike for every dollar it earns from remittances from the Middle East Mr Premadasa was also a courageous leader who did not bend in two to appease the US When the 1991 UN General Assembly resolution 4686 was sponsored by the US to nullify the 1975 resolution 3379 which rightly equated Zionism with racism Washington sought Sri Lankas support The thenUS ambassador conveyed to Mr Premadasa that President George HW Bush would like to speak to him Mr Premadasa sources privy to the incident say told the ambassador to tell his president not to waste his time Referring to Sri Lankas Muslims Mr Premadasa said he had a responsibility to a section of his constituency whose aspirations he was dutybound to fulfil This was at a time when Mr Premadasa depended on US quotas for his ambitious 200garment factory programme On Mr Premadasas instructions Sri Lanka voted against the USsponsored resolution becoming the only nonIslamic and noncommunist nation to do so A year later the US asked Sri Lanka for overflight permission for its warplanes that were being relocated from the Subic Bay naval base in the Philippines to the Middle East Mr Premadasa agreed and the decision was also overwhelmingly supported by the United National Partys Muslim ministers parliamentarians and local council members That was a time when Sri Lanka enjoyed freedom in foreign policymaking Mr Wickremesinghe was a prominent member of Mr Premadasas cabinet Though he stood by Mr Premadasa during the impeachment crisis in 1991 he does not seem to have learned the thenpresidents foreign policymaking art that incorporated principles and the aspirations of his constituency No wonder Mr Wickremesinghe is taking a foolhardy decision to deploy Sri Lankas naval forces in the Red Sea to protect international navigation from attacks from Yemens Houthi forces True it is unlawful under international law to attack international merchant ships But the Houthi action needs to be seen in the wider context of Israels genocidal campaign in Gaza The Houthis decided to attack ships destined for and owned by Israel to pressure Israel to stop its genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people after they found all efforts short of a military option had failed to stop it So as far as the motive is concerned the Houthis action is virtuous Moreover in terms of relative moralism right or wrong depends on the specific circumstances of the situation and moral judgments cannot be made without considering the context The Houthis may be right or wrong but why is Sri Lanka getting involved in a conflict that could turn into a major regional war Its argument that the Red Sea crisis is inimical to Sri Lankas economy is fragile Most war situations hurt vulnerable economies like Sri Lanka Does it mean we need to get militarily involved in every theatre to undo the harm Besides Sri Lanka does not have the type of naval craft capable of patrolling seas thousands of miles away from the countrys shores Also whatever vessels Sri Lanka deploys could become sitting ducks for Houthi drones and missiles unless our vessels get air cover from US fighter jets The government is putting Sri Lankan sailors in harms way and going by the UN Security Council resolution adopted on Wednesday the Red Sea situation is likely to aggravate into a major regional or global conflict The USsponsored resolution among other things encourages Member States to support capacitybuilding efforts of the Yemeni coastguard to protect the sovereignty and integrity of the country Analysing the resolutions text reveals a potentially dangerous situation unfolding It could mean the relative peace in Yemen after 12 years of war will soon be shattered with the USled coalition getting involved in the Yemeni war to reverse the war gains of the Houthis who are the de facto rulers of Yemen The resolution is more than protecting navigation in the Red Sea it is a US attempt to protect Israels economy which is being dealt a devastating blow by Houthi attacks on ships linked to Israel If Sri Lanka were to join the USled coalition it would imply the governments support for Israels genocide in Gaza however much it defends its position by pointing out its UN General Assembly vote in support of a Gaza ceasefire The moral question for Sri Lanka is What is Sri Lanka doing to stop the genocide in Gaza"

        "body": "New Zealand High Commissioner Michael Appleton upon completion of his stint in Sri Lanka as the first ever envoy of his country takes questions from Daily Mirror the on the elevation of his bilateral ties and what holds for the future Excerpts We greatly treasure our Sri Lankan community That community is getting larger every year I was looking at the figures the other day and its about three times larger now about 20000 people than it was at the start of the century Just reflecting on Sri Lankas crisis a lot of analysis has been done about why it happened what were the various factors And I wont get into that I think a long PhD thesis will be written about that in the goodness of time Q As the first New Zealand High Commissioner to Sri Lanka you served in Sri Lanka for three years Its the first time that New Zealand set up a mission in Sri Lanka In what ways have bilateral relations improved during these three years We are really pleased to have opened a High Commission in Sri Lanka in 2021 We opened it because we thought there was a range of ways in which our countries could get closer or cooperate more That has definitely proved the case Its been much much easier to strengthen trade investment and security cooperation because we have a High Commission here in Colombo One practical way in which its really been beneficial was working through how New Zealand might help Sri Lanka when the economic crisis happened New Zealand has an experience of economic crisis and recovery and we thought there must be lessons New Zealand could share with Sri Lanka We have been able to do that in areas like Central Bank independence public sector reforms and public financial management It would have been much harder to share those experiences bring experts here provide modest technical assistance if we hadnt a High Commission here On the ground presence has made it much easier for New Zealand to work out the ways in which New Zealand could be helpful to the Sri Lankan authorities Looking ahead as Sri Lanka recovers economically I hope the High Commission will be able to focus a lot on how to encourage more New Zealand businesses and investments into Sri Lanka so that our trade and economic relationship can become broader One practical way in which its really been beneficial was working through how New Zealand might help Sri Lanka when the economic crisis happened New Zealand has an experience of economic crisis and recovery and we thought there must be lessons New Zealand could share with Sri Lanka Q How do you look at Sri Lankas potential for the expansion of ties with New Zealand especially in terms of trade I think theres enormous potential for greater economic collaboration For a long time our trade has been focused on a small number of areas such as New Zealand milk powder to Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan tea and rubber to New Zealand I think both countries would like to expand that trading portfolio Now that were through the acute crisis phase of Sri Lankas economic crisis I hope that it might be more possible to expand those areas in the coming years New Zealand is a worldclass producer of primary products be it dairy products wine or highquality meat products We send some of those to Sri Lanka but we could be sending more in a greater variety Another area is IT New Zealand has a number of worldclass software companies and other technology companies that are starting to get involved in Sri Lanka which is a very positive thing But I know there are also IT technology companies in Sri Lanka that are very interested in providing back office support to companies in New Zealand Tourism education and skilled migration are other areas Sri Lankans going to New Zealand as international students and skilled migrants is now an upward trend The numbers that went this year are significantly higher compared to those that went in 2019 preCOVID And there are a lot of New Zealand and Sri Lankan educational institutions that are building partnerships aimed at making the flow of students in both directions easier cheaper and more accessible for Sri Lankans to have a New Zealand educational experience making it possible to start their degree here in Sri Lanka before going to New Zealand to complete it And both our countries have tourismdependent economies We each have a lot of expertise when it comes to hospitality and tourism operation I can imagine greater collaboration in that area in the future The numbers that went this year are significantly higher compared to those that went in 2019 preCOVID And there are a lot of New Zealand and Sri Lankan educational institutions that are building partnerships aimed at making the flow of students in both directions easier cheaper and more accessible Q New Zealand has become a much soughtafter destination for Sri Lankan youths especially after the economic crisis Actually can you tell us something more about the legal paths for entering New Zealand Sri Lankans have been part of New Zealands success story for a very long time Sri Lankans have migrated to New Zealand for decades and have played a very positive role in New Zealand society We greatly treasure our Sri Lankan community That community is getting larger every year I was looking at the figures the other day and its about three times larger now about 20000 people than it was at the start of the century So in the last 20 years the Sri Lankan community has increased by about three times Its continuing to grow quite rapidly because of the two major pathways in which Sri Lankans go to New Zealand international students and skilled migrants New Zealand has a range of occupations such as employment opportunities for doctors engineers dentists and teachers and we need such people in our country Sri Lanka happens to have such qualified people Over the years we have seen many Sri Lankans going to New Zealand as skilled migrants after which they become permanent residents and then citizens and thus become people who have strong connections in both New Zealand and Sri Lanka I think that is something thats beneficial to both countries Unfortunately at the same time it is important to be mindful of rising immigration scams visa fraud and other illegal migration operations targeting vulnerable Sri Lankans Indeed Sri Lankans considering the legal pathways of coming to New Zealand must also be aware of these scams and criminal enterprises I think theres enormous potential for greater economic collaboration For a long time our trade has been focused on a small number of areas such as New Zealand milk powder to Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan tea and rubber to New Zealand Q What practical cooperation do you envisage between Sri Lanka and New Zealand in the coming period New Zealand recently elected a new government and it has signalled a strong focus on this part of the world South Asia For many years New Zealand has been supportive of the development of Sri Lankas dairy industry We recognize that the Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lankan people wish for the dairy industry to become more productive more efficient and to be better able to fulfill more of the nutritional needs that Sri Lankans have New Zealand has a great deal of expertise in this area We have a dairy industry which is very large by global standards very productive very efficient and very profitable We have been trying to find small ways in which we can contribute As the Sri Lankan government and authorities work through their own plans and strategies for improving their industry and production we will be looking very closely at how we can be helpful in the period ahead as well I think that model of Sri Lanka being a platform for New Zealand companies that are interested in broader South Asian operations is one that could be replicated Sri Lanka is a similarsized country to New Zealand and for Kiwi companies its not too big not too imposing New Zealand companies can come here they can feel comfortable Its a very friendly place and they can start to operate here And the hope is that in time if theyre successful here they can use this as a base for the rest of South Asia and they can export products from here This obviously not only generates employment opportunities here in Sri Lanka but also economic benefits as well Sri Lanka is heading into an election year next year Sri Lanka has a proud history of democracy It is said that Sri Lanka is Asias oldest democracy in the sense of the longest record of uninterrupted national elections Q Sri Lanka is a kind of an unusually large market for the consumption of powdered milk What is your view about Sri Lankans habit of milk powder consumption When I first heard a long time ago about the scale of New Zealand milk powder consumption in Sri Lanka I was surprised simply because New Zealanders do not consume large quantities of milk powder Rather we mostly consume liquid milk But New Zealand milk powder is a product that has been consumed by Sri Lankans in considerable quantities for a long period of time and obviously its become part of the local palate and there is trust of the New Zealand product Various Sri Lankans like to use it for different reasons whether they drink it mixed with tea or any other beverage and because it can be used longer and its obviously a method of delivery that works here When I first heard a long time ago about the scale of New Zealand milk powder consumption in Sri Lanka I was surprised simply because New Zealanders do not consume large quantities of milk powder Q When talking about the security aspect of bilateral ties Sri Lanka is important especially because of its geostrategic positioning in the region So how do you look at Sri Lankas positioning in this regard and how does Sri Lanka matter to New Zealand in that sense I would never tell Sri Lanka how to conduct its foreign relations Thats for the Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lankan people to decide But you know New Zealand and Sri Lanka do share certain attributes when it comes to geopolitics Were both small countries that have much larger countries than us acting in our regions The Pacific Island region where New Zealand is located has a lot of attention from a lot of large countries from around the world That has some positive elements It obviously brings economic resources but it creates challenges as well of competition and potential friction What happens in New Zealands region the Pacific Island region also occurs here in the Indian Ocean And so Ive always thought and I still think after spending three years here that Sri Lanka and New Zealand can learn from one another Weve learned from one another about how we approach the fact that we are small island nations in regions with a great deal of geostrategic competition Its obviously up to us our governments and our policymakers to work out the best way of approaching that competition in the interests of our countries Just reflecting on Sri Lankas crisis a lot of analysis has been done about why it happened what were the various factors And I wont get into that I think a long PhD thesis will be written about that in the goodness of time I think that we should all feel positively that once Sri Lanka found itself in a very difficult position and it needed assistance from the international community to salvage its position Sri Lankas friends around the world rallied around Sri Lanka has a lot of friends around the world We have seen a lot of international friendship and cooperation that has enabled Sri Lankas position to stabilize A whole range of countries are interested in Sri Lanka and care about Sri Lanka That gets talked about in a negative sense sometimes but I think one positive element of it has been that there has been a huge effort by the international community collectively from a range of partners with a range of different perspectives seeking to help Sri Lanka Looking ahead obviously what happens from here is very much an issue for the Sri Lankan people Sri Lanka is heading into an election year next year Sri Lanka has a proud history of democracy It is said that Sri Lanka is Asias oldest democracy in the sense of the longest record of uninterrupted national elections This crisis happened and everyone has made efforts since then to try to stabilize the situation But in a democracy the people must and will decide what should happen next I think the international community will be supportive of the efforts of the Sri Lankan democratic system to bring about a result that is in line with the wishes of the Sri Lankan people Tourism education and skilled migration are other areas Sri Lankans going to New Zealand as international students and skilled migrants is now an upward trend Q Sri Lanka seeks to establish a diplomatic mission in New Zealand How will it help the promotion of ties We are delighted by this weeks confirmation by the Sri Lankan Government that they plan to open a High Commission in Wellington very soon I think it will be great It just makes it so much easier when youre trying to work out cooperative activity between two countries to have diplomatic missions in each others countries"

        "body": "Political freedom means the absence of coercion of a man by his fellow men The fundamental threat to freedom is power to coerce be it in the hands of a monarch a dictator an oligarchy or a momentary majority The preservation of freedom requires the elimination of such a concentration of power to the fullest possible extent The United Nations Development Programme Report from a few weeks ago showed the levels of economic disparity and inequality in Sri Lanka ranking our country as one of the top 5 most unequal countries in the Asia Pacific It further noted that the top 1 of Sri Lankas income deciles own 30 of total private wealth and the bottom 50 own less than 3 This article is part appreciation and part analysis It is a direct thank you and tribute to the DailyFTs regular columnist former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Dr WA Wijewardena I have been reading his columns for almost as long as he has been writing them Dr Wijewardena always brings a nuanced perspective to Sri Lankas economic matters In an article published on the 1st of January Still Batting and not out yet that notes his 13th year in publishing this regular column Dr Wijewardena seems to be in good form and I would urge anyone with a passing interest in economics to pay close attention to it At the outset he notes that the tagline of his column is derived from his belief that economics is relevant to every matter and hence every issue could be looked through the eyes of an economist Hence the topics covered included not only those in pure economics but also those relating to political economy and literature Notice that Dr Wijewardena makes a clear acknowledgement that economics does not exist in a vacuum that it interacts with politics and hence includes a social dynamic with foundations in philosophy Here Dr Wijewardena is clear on how he perceives the first principles of economics those which will be familiar to the reader concepts like scarcity market forces of supply and demand opportunity costs all of which interact to produce some form of efficient allocation of resources and the outcomes of such allocations In Dr Wijewardenas article he notes that the ideology he uses is based on the tendencies of the economic man the selfish ownutility maximizing ideal that individuals following their own selfinterest generate favourable or positive outcomes for society without intending to Dr Wijewardena refers to the invisible hand of Adam Smith the father of economics in the modern era A crucial caveat is introduced by Dr Wijewardena to this selfish economic man noting Smiths lesserknown work The Theory of Moral Sentiments published before the Wealth of Nations Here Smiths selfish man also seems to admit some personal pleasure from the development of others while we derive most pleasure from our own personal development we accept in some form happiness from the advancement of our fellow human beings What Smith refers to as pity or compassion is what Dr Wijewardena calls the builtin ambivalence of Homosapiens noting that therefore the economic man is not a pure selfish person Here the word ambivalence suggests a confusion or contradiction however this is not the best descriptor human beings negotiate an internal balance between what is best for themselves their dependencies immediate environment their neighbours and for society as a whole Evolutionary psychology for instance suggests that human behaviours evolved to enhance prospects for survival and prosperity as social beings producing an inherent understanding that cooperation and social norms contribute to overall wellbeing In his book The Selfish Gene Richard Dawkins discusses altruism from an evolutionary perspective similarly Robert Trivers emphasized the theory of reciprocal altruism which promotes the idea that behaviours have evolved to promote group cohesion The Great Precept of Nature It is worth considering Adam Smiths idea of what drives individual economic perspectives and how these manifests in an economic arrangement how or why this selfish economic man moderates desires with ambivalence To give its full title The Theory of Moral Sentiments or An Essay Towards an Analysis of the Principles by which Men Naturally Judge Concerning the Conduct and Character First of Their Neighbours and Afterwards of Themselves In Chapter 1 Of Sympathy from Section 1 Of the Sense of Propriety Smith is trying to explain how a human being is able to feel sympathy for another considering that we can have no immediate experience of what other men feel we can thus form no idea of the manner in which they are affected but by conceiving what we ourselves should feel in the like situation Though our brother is upon the rack as long as we ourselves are at our ease our senses will never inform as of what he suffers it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations His agonies when they are thus brought home to ourselves when we have thus adopted and made them our own begin at last to affect us and we then tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels In Chapter 5 of the same section titled Of the Amiable and Respectable Virtues Smith describes his ideal of humanity And hence it is that to feel much for others and little for ourselves that to restrain our selfish and to indulge our benevolent affections constitute to the perfection of human nature As to love our neighbour as we love ourselves is the great law of Christianity so it is the great precept of nature to love ourselves only as we love our neighbour In Moral Sentiments Smith introduces us to his concept of the Impartial Spectator described as emphasising the rational and reasoned moral assessment of a given situation or incident Smith notes the necessity to remove ourselves from feelings of being affected But we admire that noble and generous resentment which governs its pursuit of the greatest injuries not by the rage which they are apt to excite in the breast of the sufferer but by the indignation which they naturally call forth in that of the impartial spectator which allows no word to escape it beyond what this more equitable sentiment would dictatenor desires to inflict any greater punishment than what every indifferent person would rejoice to see executed These are just some examples of what Smith thought of humanitys inclinations to morality that concerns of equity and justice and proportionality were inherent to the human psyche Adam Smith was a key figure of the Enlightenment era that lays the philosophical foundations for economics The essence of humanity and its impacts upon the societies we create were matters of great consequence to such enlightenment thinkers JeanJacques Rousseau wrote about how social structures impacted human nature before him Hobbes Leviathan discussed the social contract and the principles of mutual protection and cooperation Free to Choose Let us contrast this to a more modern perspective of a particular branch and brand of economics and how it utilizes Adam Smith and the selfish economic man while disregarding the moral foundations that he observed as governing the intentions and actions of men market participants Prof Milton Friedman a Nobel Prize winner is one of modern historys most prominent economists dominating the field in the 1970s and 80s advising American Presidents and foreign governments Friedman has been credited with or blamed for installing the freemarket principles that he considered to be essential to maximizing the positive effects of capitalism Friedman echoed the aforementioned selfish man and positive contingencies of his utilitymaximizing pursuit of selfinterest There is a certain villainous quality attributed by some to Friedmans policy protocols and their foundational values something I will try to avoid Instead I will simply present some aspects of his doctrine Friedman is closely associated with Friedrich von Hayek and follows this school of limited government which according to the Friedman doctrine limits the freedom of individuals to choose their own destiny as it were Thus Friedman does not support social welfare or a safetynet but has at various times in his career supported a negative income tax cash transfers from the state most famously under the Nixon administration Friedman is thus elusive in Capitalism and Freedom 1962 he notes that the existence of a free market does not of course eliminate the need for government On the contrary a government is essential both as a forum for determining the rules of the game and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on What the market does is to reduce greatly the range of issues that must be decided through political means and thereby to minimize the extent to which government need participate directly in the game It is this feature of the market that we refer to when we say that the market provides economic freedom Friedman has also discussed the links as he saw them between political freedom and economic freedom stating that Political freedom means the absence of coercion of a man by his fellow men The fundamental threat to freedom is power to coerce be it in the hands of a monarch a dictator an oligarchy or a momentary majority The preservation of freedom requires the elimination of such a concentration of power to the fullest possible extent By removing the organization of economic activity from the control of political authority the market eliminates this source of coercive power It enables economic strength to be a check to political power rather than a reinforcement Capitalism and Freedom 1962 Rationality and Self Interest It is left to the reader to analyze the short and longterm outcomes of Friedmans various projects of consultancy to world leaders and governments some directly others through the Mont Pellerin Society the Reagan and Thatcher eras Chile in the 70s Russia and Poland postUSSR Whatever the judgement of these outcomes and whatever characteristics of Friedmans and by extension Adam Smiths philosophies that might be attributed to those outcomes it is important to note that even Friedman was not preaching an economic doctrine that was value neutral in fact he had a very clear hierarchy of values with personal freedom at the very top Ultimately in the same way that rationality does not always reflect selfinterest the study of economics cannot be value neutral and thus neither can economic policy Policy generates something like a system the outcomes of that system will imply some set of explicit and implicit values derived from some hierarchy of priorities All this is the necessary basis to accept the claim that economic policy makes tradeoffs with implicit and explicit value judgements Every time we view a policy we ought to acknowledge its underlying values and the outcomes this policy is striving to attain outcomes that can be measured The United Nations Development Programme Report from a few weeks ago showed the levels of economic disparity and inequality in Sri Lanka ranking our country as one of the top 5 most unequal countries in the Asia Pacific It further noted that the top 1 of Sri Lankas income deciles own 30 of total private wealth and the bottom 50 own less than 3 This is how we have organised our economic system and society it also seems to be how we have continued in the wake of a financial and economic collapse brought about by policy failures through negligence and shorttermism What do these outcomes and results say about our value systems and morality what does it reflect What does the commentary and the way we discuss issues like poverty distress inflation stability inform us about the system we exist in Think back to Dr Wijewardenas eyes of an economist an economist is a person with perspective that might well be distinct but is still grounded in some set of first principles a value system through which they propose policy and measure its outcomes What would Adam Smith and the enlightenment thinkers have to say about Sri Lankas policy outcomes and how might they differ from Milton Friedman Some might wonder how economics and humanity have travelled so far and yet achieved so little Email kusumwgmailcom Twitter kusumw The writer has 15 years of experience in the Financial

        "body": "Men in military attire have continued to win the trust of the islands citizens during the civil war and even afterwards Even during and after the countrys civil war the men in military attire received much respect in society There was an advertisement run on television some years ago on behalf of the Army where we see a lady offering her seat to a soldier boarding the same bus she is travelling on The monk and man in military uniform can suddenly develop an interest in taking to politics and holding office and do it at the expense of stopping the promotion of a suitable candidate that the people will also back Sri Lanka has begun a new year with petrol gas and all essential goods available in the market but the countrys citizens are still in search of a leader who can be trusted Recently there was a video that went viral on Youtube where a prospective presidential candidate met with one of the chief prelates of a wellknown Buddhist chapter in the Central Province and instead of winning the heart of the saffron robed monk was forced to eat humble pie The monk didnt mince his words and told the politician that Sri Lanka will have to bring down a leader from an overseas land because this island nation is totally incapable of producing one Regardless of when this meeting took place and the date this video was uploaded the content in the creation posted on social media presents facts to ponder on We voters talk about our tax monies being used to maintain the expensive habits and lifestyles of ministers and members of Parliament But we must talk about maintaining the clergy and members of the security forces and also the Police Government records show us that a large portion of government revenue goes to maintain the security forces and this is of concern because there is no presence of a war in the country It is at a time like this that the government is using the Police to harass innocent people by checking homes and even forcing people to disembark from buses on their way to work with the aim of nabbing drugs being carried by any individual When homes are searched for drugs little children who reside in them and have no connection with drugs will have to answer questions from friends who might ask why was your home searched last night Such operations shown on television with the full support of law enforcement officers make us pose the question Are media ethics practised in this country when covering a raid conducted by the law enforcement officers in the society Whatever said and done the saffron robed monks and the security forces Police not taken into account here wield much clout in the country as two sections of the society which can be trusted From the two the security forces can easily be named as an institute which has won the hearts of the people in terms of trust The manner in which security forces work efficiently and mingle with people of all communities has been seen time and again during catastrophes and natural disasters Even during and after the countrys civil war the men in military attire received much respect and a lofty place in society There was an advertisement run on television some years ago on behalf of the Army where we see a lady offering her seat to a soldier boarding the same bus she is travelling on This is the type of support and respect the Sri Lankan military has when one of its members steps into society There are people in this nation who promote the school of thought that Sri Lanka needs a leader with a military background Not very long ago we had former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka Field Marshal now and the present Chairman of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya contesting the Presidential Elections where he took on the then incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa With no political experience behind him Fonseka garnered as much as 4015 percent of the votes and most importantly won the hearts of the northern and eastern province voters despite losing the election These two provinces were the worst affected by the war and still these voters believed that Fonseka was a better candidate than the incumbent President This idea that people of this country trust men in uniform is used to underscore the concept of trust and where it exists right now and not to compare individuals The saffron robe and the military garb can still be used to create magic from a political perspective But a danger lies therein that the monk and man in military uniform can suddenly develop an interest in taking to politics and holding office and do it at the expense of stopping the promotion of a suitable candidate that the people will also back This is what has happened in recent years and priests and exmilitary men have got into politics and even entered Parliament Right now even though individuals in saffron robes have lost some of their clout in the political scene in recent times the men in uniform are still held in high esteem by the public In this context an exArmy official like Fonseka could be a dark horse running a race from a political point of view For the record Fonseka has been quoted in the media recently that he is willing to contest the next Presidential elections if the people of this country want him to President Wickremesinghe has delivered when it comes to putting the economy on track and ensuring the availability of the most essential commodities which were scarce during the Aragalaya period But he is wanting in terms of getting rid of corrupt politicians who are associated with corruption charges and are still enjoying perks as Parliamentarians This is why critics believe that Wickremesinghe must go but his economic thinking must remain Take for an example India and Bangladesh If one takes the political histories of these two nations economic policies of exprime ministers have continued despite there being a change of leader India and Bangladesh have never dared to do anything adverse to derail their economies just because an unpopular leader is ousted from power Sri Lanka has often harmed its trust factor from a foreign investor perspective because a change of regime in the island has often brought a change in economic plans and policies as well Sri Lankan voters must let an old saying reproduced in this column sink into their heads That saying goes as trust lost is similar to a woman losing her virginity once lost they can never be recovered"

to turn this original Aragalayas heartfelt cry for honourable leaders into something sinister is simply to discount reality Our government at the moment is a splintered chess board Its players will

new government we hope and this is hardly the time for new committees new appointments new education schemes new ANYTHING to be proposed and begun We PRAY daily for good governance but despite the input of a few worthwhile men this is not happening Our President has adroitly seen us through an appalling period but now we are starting to worry Where is the system change we are gasping for On the

Public emotions are blending into one bleak environment of distaste and fury right now Electricity The recent power blackout shook us up mightily Was it sabotage Was it an accident Was it a genuine fault Whatever criticisms there may be I still feel that Minister Kanchana Wijesekera is a hard working and sincere young man who has dealt with the Electricity Board Mafia as best as he could Can the government assure us that the top heavy Electricity Board moguls will stop cheating us Take the problems of citizens like us who optimistically installed Solar power a few years ago All went well at first but not so well of late Bills are high again When we complain to the Electricity Board the bill fixers tell us that the solar panels are not working properly The bills fluctuate madly from Rs 7000 in one month to Rs 30000 three months later The owner of a residence near mine got a bill of Rs 19000 in one month with NO ONE LIVING IN THE HOUSE These solar panels have been checked and rechecked by harassed solar panelists who assure us that there is nothing wrong with the panels Of course we believe THEM and not the rascally bill senders of the Electricity Board The Minister tries his best to rectify matters but who can loosen the strangle hold of those government engineers Once corruption is banished AT THE TOP the country will follow suit But with a few exceptions like our President along with a tiny number of educated parliamentarians we only see devastatingly venal men who have access to the countrys finances which they spend without shame or conscience When corrupt beings are named they claim it was their private incomes they were playing around with Resounding condemnation must follow a Minister whose antics and venality has resulted in numerous medical disasters Indirectly he is a clear murderer As one wit said The only part of our economy that seems to be looking up is our living costs Weddings and Parties It is a common criticism that those who indulge in luxury entertainment are somehow being unpatriotic at this time of national insolvency I do not agree My view is that money gets circulated by these grandiose spenders Hotels are kept afloat waiters keep their jobs food sellers are profiting and a circulation of money is helping the economy After all I see no possible objection to people spending what they can obviously afford There are benefits all round Of course their insensitivity to the sorrows everywhere is another matter Diplomatic Appointments Recently a few deplorable and ludicrous appointments were made in our diplomatic service causing palpable tension among the existing personnel Our Foreign Service should take a lesson from India which reputedly has the highest standard of diplomats in the world ALL of them speak perfect English ALL of them have passed one of the most rigid diplomatic academic exams ever to be given ALL of them have excellent Indian University Degrees and NONE of them have anything obnoxious about their past behavior Of course most of them are career diplomats anyway A recent Sri Lankan DPL appointment to an important western country horrified us and we strongly question the sanity of our government What possible benefit could accrue to Sri Lanka with such a person and his family replacing a most efficient and charming lady diplomat who was our former High Commissioner in that land Several years ago I had the occasion to deal with the Deputy High Commissioner in Delhi He could hardly speak good English and he was a career DPL Our Foreign Service has many intelligent and personable Sri Lankans but it should remain an independent body free of all political meddling Nondiplomatic appointments for ambassadorial posts are sometimes so illdeserved they cause outright derision as this latest outrageous choice has done The IMFs Second Tranche Recently we read that we have got that second IMF tranche The President must have had to use all his navigational skills to

talking as if they have a future They are unashamed of their corruption and continue to pretend they have an apparent following The Aragalaya That first Aragalaya was a genuine desire for system change It was a heartfelt uprising that brought all the nationalities of Sri Lankans together It brought all ages together It united religious bodies It united Sri Lankans from age 6 to age 106 And yes My husband DOES have an aunt who is a healthy 106yearold and in full possession of her faculties Politicians are fooling themselves if they imagine that the masses have forgotten Attempts to turn this original Aragalayas heartfelt cry for honourable leaders into something sinister is simply to discount reality Our government at the moment is a splintered chess board Its players will face an eventual checkmate But do they realise this The Aragalaya display of unity was democracy at its best The governments attempts to cover up the sincerity of the movement is political slipperiness at its worst Garbage Dengue is rising we read Why then is garbage collection taking place just once a week in my area of Kotte To add to our infuriated feelings residents of other areas are throwing their garbage into our bird sanctuary under the cover of darkness Environmental protests go the way of all complaints Nothing is ever done Right on cue an inspector visits us one day and tries to fine me Rs 25000 for having a bird bath cleaned daily which he claims houses dengue larvae My loudly voiced tantrum worked for once and he retreated muttering angrily to be on the safe side however I upturned the bird bath The behaviour of these local tyrants causes the many rents and tears in the fabric of our dealing with the local government Taxes go up as the quality of life spirals down The daily act of living in Sri Lanka is turning into a drama worthy of Sophocles The English Education Question The benefit of such an education is a selfevident truth however stubbornly and stupidly the chauvinists oppose it Mentioning the reasons for the necessity of English AGAIN is a waste of time On every talk show on every Peoples Proflie programme on every educational discussion on every sensible TV show in fact almost NATIONALLY the opinion of every thinking Sri Lanka is that a return to the English medium is desperately needed Hold a referendum if proof be needed The blue collar workers estate workers farmers illpaid government workers et al will be among the first to vote for it because at the moment ENGLISH IS DENIED TO THEM thanks to absurd and outofdate teaching methods Running parallel to this drawback is the lack of teachers Many teachers of English in government schools can barely speak English themselves For how long is this bankrupt nation going to pour good money after bad to keep this system going Our educational methods are simply out of date Here is a hint for campaigning politicians Promise a return to the English Medium and watch the votes roll in Of course this promise requires a sensible and workable plan which educationists like Dr Tara de Mel Dr Savitri Goonesekera Dr Chandrika Wijeratne and many many capable others would be happy to arrange for our presently clueless government Prices The press tells us that people are reducing daily meals from three to two a day Soon this will become one meal a day while THE GOVERNMENT TAKES ALL OUR MONEY Electricity is a necessity Water is a necessity WHY ARE WE BEING TAXED SO HEAVILY FOR THEM Can we stop using water and electricity The poor mans supply of both is cut off for nonpayment of the bills Ministers Government officials certain big businesses with influence have not paid millions in taxes Their power and water supplies are never cut off This is just asking for an eventual tsunami of public revenge What the population thinks about all this mismanagement should curdle the blood of those thoughtless idiots at the top The blue collar workers will not put up with it when they are reduced to beggary a situation fast coming The dark cloud building up on the horizon will be overwhelming and will roll inexorably over a government that seems deaf and blind to the daily desperate howls of anguish Let politicians who listen to their sycophantic followers beware LIFE IN SRI LANKA IS MURKILY UNBALANCED Hope I end as I started There is always HOPEfaint though it may be at this moment The miasmic cloud seems to grow in intensity On behalf of many I plead for party leaders to DROP the majority of those who hold seats in the House at the moment If the mood of the country is totally misunderstood as seems to be happening a storm will be unleashed about our lovely island destroying the governed and governing alike Will 2024 be a year of destruction or as is STILL possible will it be a year heralding a Sri Lankan Renaissance goolbaigmailcom"

questioned trade unions on the demands that they made prior to launching strike action On Tuesday January 9 staffers in the paramedic services launched an unannounced token strike that crippled the countrys already ailing healthcare sector The strike was launched in wake of the government approving to double the Disturbance Availability and Transport DAT allowance for doctors by Rs 70000 but refused the same for technicians laboratory workers and other staffers employed in the paramedic services sector As a result public health inspectors PHIs public health midwives ophthalmic technicians laboratory technicians and employees in several other sectors later announced that they would continue strike action for another 48 hours with effect from Tuesday demanding the government to approve a Rs 35000 allowance for them as well A fair demand It has been six months since we requested authorities to increase the fuel allowance of Rs 1200 that is being provided to employees in the paramedic services said PHI Union President Upul Rohana Hospital staff has complained of lapses in transport facilities The DAT allowance provided for the paramedic services staff is only Rs 3000 Therefore it is unfair that the government approved an allowance only for the doctors he added Around 25000 people are employed in the paramedic services sector and according to the trade unions they have been working for a pittance We thought it wouldnt be appropriate to launch trade union action as the government was facing an economic crisis But it now looks like the government indeed has money and therefore we too are demanding a considerable allowance than what is already being paid to us In addition to the fuel and DAT allowance paramedic services staff are entitled to overtime and public holiday allowances But doctors are being paid an overtime allowance that is four times more than what is being paid for employees in this sector Rohana further said TUsto continue strike action In a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe Joint Council on Paramedic Health Professionals President Ravi Kumudesh expressed his disappointment over granting an allowance only for doctors The letter reiterated that they would take stern trade union action if their demands are not fulfilled However staffers at childrens maternity kidney and cancer hospitals and the central blood bank would continue their services on a voluntary basis to minimise inconveniences faced by patients He further said that the strike action would continue in different stages and that they would intensify their actions if the government fails to respond within the week TU leaders aggravating the health crisis GMOA However the Government Medical Officers Association GMOA questioned trade unions on the demands that they made prior to launching the strike action These employees also requested for a Rs 20000 allowance for state sector employees and already the government had approved a Rs 10000 allowance said GMOA Secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge There are various categories in the administrative service and the allowances for doctors differ from those allocated for employees in other categories Therefore it is rather funny to see employees in the paramedic services demanding the same benefits as those allocated for doctors So far the government has approved 50 of their demand by granting a Rs 10000 allowance for state sector employees but the government has failed to approve at least 10 of demands made by doctors said Dr Aluthge Speaking about the allowance granted for doctors Dr Aluthge further said that the government has taken a step in the right direction in ensuring economic justice for doctors We repeatedly made the government aware of the assets that they are losing in the wake of multiple crises that affected the country over the past 23 years One of the biggest challenges we faced was in retaining doctors in the country Therefore we provided various recommendations from time to time and several of these including promotions for doctors in different grades were implemented in the 2024 Budget as well he added Dr Aluthge further said that senior employees in the state sector are entitled to a specific transport allowance estimated at Rs 150000 From this they cover their fuel costs driver fees etc but doctors werent entitled to a transport allowance Instead what they were entitled to was the DAT allowance As per the last update in 2015 doctors were promised a Rs 40000 allowance but they only received Rs 35000 In 2018 the estimated DAT allowance for doctors was Rs 150000 However with the recent increase in fuel prices the DAT allowance entitled for doctors is estimated at Rs 300000Therefore the decision to increase this allowance has provided some hope for doctors to continue their services in the country he said"

        "body": "Sri Lanka has its very own illustrious history in politics where the country recorded the swearing in of its first female prime minister which also marked the first such instance in the world That was none other than Sirimavo Bandaranaike and she was sworn in as Prime Minister on July 21 1960 Sri Lankan women are not in decision making positions stressed Former MP and one time minister of housing and common amenities Ferial Ashraff Speaking to the Daily Mirror she said that she doubted whether this situation has been caused due to the attitude of the society She also raised her concerns saying that the number of opportunities given to women at decision making level is extremely low Also she mentioned with disappointment that one can rarely a find a woman holding extremely higher portfolios On the other hand she doubted how men can take decisions on behalf of women Ferial is the wife of late former MP MHM Ashraff She said that she got to know people because of her husband She stressed a common norm in this society by underscoring that she wouldnt have had an opportunity to be known in society if she wasnt connected to a family with a political background where a male was involved in politics We only have widows sisters of dead men daughters of dead men who come into politics True enough because that is the only way we get introduced to the public thats why the majority of women who enter politics have to have a male involved in politics added Ferial She appreciates the 25 quota set aside for women representation in politics an idea which was introduced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Local Government Elections She said that she would appreciate if there is a quota for women in parliamentary elections as well She sees something positive in this quota because there is at least one opportunity for women to come forward in politics Moreover she sees a problem with the women in the society too She said that women are also casting their votes for a male representative during the elections If you are a woman and contesting at an election where there is a male candidate all the women would vote for the man This is because they dont have the confidence that female politician will be able to deliver Because females are used to the concept where men are engaged in politics 52 of the population in Sri Lanka comprises women So who has to change man or woman The woman has to change Women should understand that they should actively participate at the decisionmaking level explained Ferial She stressed This country wouldnt be this bankrupt if we had women out there said Ferial She added that if there are not enough women representations in parliament the relevant decision makers at the parliament must have at least a woman consultative body I am saying women have to be consulted Involve the women in decision and policy making Appoint consultative bodies comprising women Appoint women consultants regarding policy issues When the parliament makes decisions consider the ideas of women too When we speak about womens issues people think that we are trying to convey that women are the best Here we are speaking about gender balance There should be a balance in women and men representation added Ferial In order to change this attitude Ferial said that the Sri Lankan education system should be changed The education system must convey the message to children about the importance of women and they should be taught about the gender balance and not that a mother is there to cook at home and the father is there to go to work and earn There are things that we learn which are totally not right Therefore I suggest that both women and men learnunlearn and relearn We cant progress by having gender bias Men and women have to work together The country has to work together We cant be divided and progress We must get onto the right track Otherwise we wont progress explained Ferial We have much child abuse and domestic violence and we dont see women coming up with suggestions Former Colombo Municipal Councilor Sharmila Gonawala told Daily Mirror She affirmed that there are not enough female representatives in parliament and though there are a few female representatives in the parliament they are not making strong suggestions They dont make a joint effort They dont make a constant effort and at least if the men are not doing anything the women parliamentarians should get together and suggest that this country has to be developed based on the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs 17 which is internationally accepted I think knowledge is number one and then you have to update and upgrade your knowledge everything else said Gonawala There are right women capable women and right candidates who want to come up they have not been given that opportunity because there is always a widow a daughter or a sister coming from a political family Even the British have said that we Sri Lankans were not ready to embrace democracy because we would have always voted the wrong people in she said Gonawala said she was disappointed about how candidates have been elected from the political parties What Gonawala suggests is that there should be at least 15 women representation in the Parliament She added that women candidates who have a heart and common sense and who are capable of taking the country forward must enter parliament Until there is a national policy regarding the number of women in the nomination list it would be very difficult To win you have to be in the nomination list of the winning party I think that is the biggest hurdle that a woman encounters added Gonawala Attacks through social media Bisliya Bhutto is a former member of Puttalam Pradesiya Sabha who encountered so many religious and cultural barriers at the time she wished to enter politics When she was elected to the Pradesiya Sabha she recalled how there were cyber attacks on her and the making of fake social media accounts in her name which were used against her Also her photos had been circulated on social media and fake details about her were spread While recalling such memories Bisliya said When women try to enter politics without the support of a male who is already involved in politics it is really hard for them to survive because females are subject to getting blackmailed Bisliya mentioned that there are religious and cultural barriers for women who wish to enter politics Former Head of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Dr Deepika Udagama when contacted said that it is very difficult to change the existing political system in Sri Lanka She said You cant have a system which is very hierarchical I think the political situation in Sri Lanka is full of problems When political parties are not very democratic they dont have internal democracy It is really futile to talk about larger representation for women and minorities First we have to focus on the larger picture of the political system The political system really needs new faces new political parties with a modern vision of Sri Lanka explained Dr Udagama She appreciated the 25 quota for female representation that was introduced in local government elections But to fill that quota in the existing political system much is desired because the party system is hugely male oriented very hierarchical not democratic and males dont want to share opportunities First we must focus on this then on the political parties and then of course I think we need to have laws that ensure this quota for women That is absolutely essential Having quotas is very important In some African countries women have really come forward in political representation and this may be due to the quota system Create an environment where political parties are forced to support female candidates because of the quota system 25 quota for women at the local government is inadequate but still they introduced this system There has to be better discussions in the public about the need for female representatives You see in parliament how they run down female politicians They attack them using foul language That is the current situation Political parties should respect female candidates There have to be a major change in the mind set You cant promote the idea of women representation in this existing political culture Because it is too hierarchical explained Dr Udagama She stressed that with the current existing political system in Sri Lanka it is not efficient to have quotas for women representation She said that this country needs more new political parties with new young faces Executive Director at Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies IRES and the former national coordinator for Centre for Monitoring Election Violence CMEV Manjula Gajanayake said that in political representation there should be an equal ground Gajanayake stated that women participation in Sri Lankan politics doesnt meet the standard level He appreciated the introduction of the 25 quota for women representation but affirmed that it is not enough Luckily there is a quota for women representation and it is 25 Even that 25 has not been fulfilled considering all local councils urban councils and provincial councils and municipal councils They have fulfilled only 238 only Not 25 added Gajanayake He assumes that women do not want to take part in politics due to the discrimination against them He points out that the political parties are also responsible for this because they dont nominate females to the nomination list The major problem in Sri Lanka is not the quantity of women representation The problem is that mainstream parties representing our parliament are not giving an opportunity to women to contest in politics That is a major issue If there are enough women at the executive levels of political parties it is easy to promote women political participation in Sri Lanka Unfortunately it is not happening added Gajanayake He disagreed with the statement that women are not voting for women Gajanayake mentioned that if the women election campaigns are creative they will garner more votes Gajanayake has a positive outlook towards the campaign finance law because he believes that this law can promote women representation in politics in this country Gajanayke doesnt believe that money will be a barrier for the women who contest at elections Unfortunately when we compare ourselves with the women in other countries our females have taken a back seat What did the government do to promote women participation in politics in Sri Lanka Only the Yahapalana Government did something They introduced the quota Even the Ministry of Women Child Affairs and Social Empowerment failed in this Most political parties are not inviting women to come forward and raise their voices One reason is jealousy For decades in Sri Lanka men have been thinking that politics belong to them Male politicians are feeling insecure therefore they are not giving opportunities to women to come forward Honestly I am thinking that as a head of election monitoring I also think that we are not promoting women enough We can select some women who are very capable explained Gajanayake Legal expert and former Human Rights Commissioner Dr Prathiba Mahanamahewa told the Daily Mirror that some laws should be introduced in order to attract more women into Sri Lankan politics A law should be passed Every political party must be given an opportunity to contest elections especially at the municipal council provincial council Pradeshiya sabha as well as general elections I recommend a quota between 15 25 for women from each political party It is happening in India So when you take the Sri Lankan parliament and the 225 representatives at least 25 of them should be women said DrMahanamahewa Dr Mahanamahewa said Women need energy and encouragement This encouragement is not present in the Asian culture So women should be encouraged to enter politics from university level Most of the time women are engaged in household work looking after children and are busy with husbands work When women enter politics there are other harassments taking place When you take universities 85 of the students comprise female candidates Educated women graduates are there But they are not given the opportunities in Sri Lanka Basically in the legislature they think that the women are not capable Still in politics it is very hard to get women participation There are so many barriers for these women Also there are family barriers and sometimes the husband may not be giving the consent When you compare with some other countries women are not independent in Sri Lanka Women are not empowered like in other countries That is a cultural barrier Women in other countries have changed the world My argument is that to have a sound and balanced parliament at least 25 female representation must be there he said underscoring the dangers of the decline in women participation in politics The Picture of Ferial Ashraff was taken by Pradeep Pathirana"

        "body": "Northern Tamil elites always had a problem It is not just a gripe with the successive Sinhalesedominated governments that have ruled since independence The problem is more fundamental It is about reconciling with the existential realities of the demographic composition of the country and the corresponding distribution of power The incestual circuit of NGO captains and root learning academics would blame that on discrimination However an objective analysis would reveal this as a function of the Dravidian ethnic political nationalism And the problem predates independence Jaffna boycotted the first State Council elections in 1931 held under the Donoughmore reforms which introduced universal suffrage Though the wellintentioned Gandhian Youth opposed the reforms demanding full independence the traditional Northern elites opposed the reforms over the abolition of communal representation hence losing their hitherto enjoyed disproportionate representation Later the same concerns led to GG Ponnambalams call for 5050 representation under the Soulbury Constitution which the British turned down Nationalism can be good when one takes pride in ones national identity national achievement or roots for their cricket team But more often than not when pushed further nationalism degenerates into an us verses them dichotomy leading to a sense of exceptionalism that pits communities against each other and creates division Ethnic nationalism is more prone to this for it generally thrives in amplifying differences and overlooking similarities with other communities If you divide ethnic nationalism into majority nationalism and minority nationalism though both forces tend to react to each other minority nationalism is still more sustainable and less challenged by other extraneous factors than majority nationalism Since majority nationalism as a governing identity cannot function in isolation from a myriad of other mainly bread and butter functions though some governments would wrap themselves in a cloak of a heightened sense of nationalism to blind the public from its failures and find external enemies to blame such machinations are not sustainable in political systems in competitive multiparty elections The collapse of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration which prided itself in SinhalaBuddhist ethnonationalism through the protests of its constituency is a case in point Even in Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoan who played into a mixture of Islamism and Turkish nationalism faced near defeat though he survived by the public disgruntled by the governments poor handling of the economy In contrast minority nationalism insulates itself from much of these peripheral forces It defines itself first and foremost on its ethnic aspirations and identity and over time these forces lead to voluntary detachment from the state As a result it absolves itself from duties of the provision of goods and services to its people The latter becomes a secondary concern only to be achieved when true ethnic liberation is achieved Any attempt to cooperate with the state in return for development is frowned upon and could well lead to delegitimization and will be labeled as a sellout by the competing nationalist elites in the same ethnonationalist tent Anyone who takes a cursory look at the trajectory of the Northern Tamil politics since independence would see all these elements at play As the country went to multiparty competitive elections Tamil parties competed with each other to become more nationalistic than the other In the process engagement with the Sinhalesedominated Centre was deemed a betrayal SJV Chelvnayakam parted ways with GG Ponnambalam when the latter became a Minister of the first independent Cabinet of DS Senanayaka Over time disengagement with the state grew into a sinister desire to undermine it and later to its destruction The Tamil insurgency and later LTTE terrorism are all products of an earlier calculated use of nationalism going out of control of its original makers taking a life of its own which effectively cost the lives of a previous generation of Tamil elites If you take a dispassionate assessment of the contribution of northern Tamil politics to the Sri Lankan state it would come as a net negative You cannot say the same about Muslim politics or upcountry Tamil politics But why this grotesque contrast The answer lies in the Dravidian exceptionalism that defines Tamil politics at the expense of all other civic duties to the state However the problem with nationalism is once you get there there is no easy way out It is a selfreinforcing force which takes a life of its own Now some Tamil politicians have mooted the idea of fielding a common Tamil Presidential candidate Interestingly the idea was first proposed by CV Vigneshwaran a former Supreme Court judge a man who had benefitted most from the Sri Lankan state Vigneshwaran reminds me of Shiva Pasupati Attorney General from 1975 88 who became the LTTEs chief constitutional expert What would all these machinations mean for the Tamil people and the country at large Firstly before reading too much into the purported collective Tamil aspirations of this move one should glance through petty personal interests This is a move borne out of interparty competition and is aimed at the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ITAK the main Tamil political party and the main constituent party of the Tamil National Alliance Thus history does not just rhyme it repeats itself ITAK in line with its postLTTE political pragmatism is likely to support a candidate from one of the Sinhalesedominated alliances It did so when it endorsed Sarath Fonseka in 2010 and Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 However Tamil nationalist fringe such as Vigneswarans Tamil Peoples National Alliance and Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalams All Ceylon Tamil Congress are competing with the ITAK Vigneshwaran has reportedly proposed Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalam as the common candidate though he appears to promote himself Secondly the collective Tamil aspirations the proponents of the idea aim to achieve are unclear Most likely they would achieve precious nothing because a Tamil candidate contesting on Tamil nationalism cannot win by the simple demographic reality Instead it would polarize not just the Tamil community but the country at large because electoral slogans of such a campaign would trigger its equivalent in the South That perhaps is the objective Thirdly this would further discredit the cooperation with the central government a throwback to the past from Chelvnayakams split from Ponnambalam to the assassination of Alfred Duraiappah Legitimate Tamil political aspirations can only be achieved through cooperation with the Centre Economic development in the North is not possible without engagement with the Centre The Northern elites are not keen on addressing those immediate concerns solving them dampens their cause Therefore this is not a move to solve any of the real or imagined grievances of the Tamils Fourthly it is a national security question A noholdsbarred campaigning by the main Tamil constituent parties ahead of the general election in 1977 led to the Vaddukoddai resolution That was the harbinger of the nascent Tamil militancy which later degenerated into terrorist barbarism at the hand of the LTTE and lasted for the next 25 years One should be concerned about where another Tamil nationalist project rooted solely in slogans not so different from the past would lead Everyone should make sure it would not lead to another MulliVaikkal Follow RangaJayasuriya on X"

        "body": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe had claimed during his Northern Province tour over the weekend there are ample powers awarded to provincial councils to establish a robust local economy under the provisions of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution He urged provinces to utilize the powers granted by the 13th Amendment for economic development asserting that devolution should not merely be a political concept but an economic reality This claim seems not to go well with the stand taken by the Tamil leaders who have been demanding more powers to the provincial councils under a more comprehensive power sharing scheme as a lasting solution to the ethnic problem They might view this as an attempt to circumvent those demands and akin to the stand held by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa Rajapaksa within days after he assumed office stated during a meeting with newspaper editors that he would replace devolution with development as a solution to the problems of the Tamil people in the Northern and Eastern Provinces He further said that he did not believe in devolution as a solution to the Tamil peoples problems And also President Wickremesinghes statement comes against the backdrop of his recent statement during a meeting with Tamil leaders that the 13th Amendment would be fully implemented within a year after the next Parliamentary election Nevertheless assertion that devolution should not merely be a political concept but an economic reality is theoretically perfect and it is very appropriate to be highlighted at an event held in the north since many Tamil leaders seem not to have realized it During the only time a provincial council the Northern Provincial Council NPC was under their purview they used it as a tool to promote their political slogans rather than attempting to resolve the economic issues in the war ravaged region The NPC throughout the tenure under Chief Minister CV Wigneswaran was accused of being overpoliticized Media reports during the tail end of his term said that the NPC had adopted 415 resolutions during its five year tenure on average seven resolutions per day it had convened but many resolutions adopted had been related to issues which mostly did not come within the purview of the NPC Some of the resolutions such as the one claiming that Tamil genocide had occurred during the war between the armed forces and the LTTE and the one calling to establish a federal form of government may come within the purview of the council and be legally valid but it would have been more appropriate for the TNA to adopt it within the party while the NPC carried out the development activities of the region On the other hand the PC system is in fact flawed in a way as the Centre has more clout in interfering in the mechanism Wigneswaran as the Chief Minister was not able to transfer the Chief Secretary of his province who he accused of not cooperating for a long time And the provincial leaders are not being consulted when a Governor is appointed by the President This had created a huge conflict between the Northern Provincial Council and the Central Government and the repeated requests by Wigneswaran to appoint a civilian Governor was rejected for a long time Wigneswaran had in those days alleged that the Governors assent was not given to many statutes Acts passed by his provincial council Ultimately the issues of the Governor and the Chief Secretary were resolved only after a new administration the Yahapalana Government was installed at the Centre President Wickremesinghe while encouraging the Tamil leaders to make use of the PC mechanism had pledged not to intervene in the affairs of the provincial councils However this pledge does not grant any assurance of proper devolution in the light of the governments reluctance to hold the PC elections the manner in which issues were handled until 2015 and the Governors powers to supersede those of the council Problems must be resolved through mechanisms and not through good people or political affiliationspersonal connections"

        "body": "Gazan refugees in Khan Younis The Telegraph of the UK recently reported that Israel is planning to send all the Palestinian residents of Gaza to Congo or any other country willing to take them under what it calls a Gazan Voluntary Migration Scheme It is proposed to implement the scheme after the war ends And the vacant space in Gaza will be given to Jewish settlers with army protection Though Israel calls this nefarious scheme a Voluntary Migration Scheme it will in realty be a case of Transactional Forced MigrationTFM to use the term coined by Fiona B Adamson and Kelly M Greenhill in their paper DealMaking Diplomacy and Transactional Forced Migration in the journal International Affairs March 6 2023 Transactional Forced Migration or TFM is a kind of trade a trade in people instead of goods and services One country pays the other for accepting its unwanted folks In the Gaza case hapless Gazans wrenched from their ancestral lands and homes will be relocated in Congo which will be accepting them in exchange for a hefty sum from Israel Such deals are not uncommon in international relations Adamson and Greenhill point out Israeli Plan Congo will be willing to take in migrants and were in talks with others also a senior source in the security cabinet told the news website Zman Israel Gazan migration is becoming the leading policy of the government as a solution to the conflict the report said The Guardian said that the National Security Minister Itamar BenGvir asked Palestinians in Gaza to move to other countries The farRight leader Bezalel Smotrich voiced his support Danny Danon a member of the Israeli Knesset Parliament claimed that the world is already discussing the possibilities of voluntary immigration Backers for such forced migration are in Netanyahus Likud party too Gila Gamliel the Intelligence Minister told Zman Israel Voluntary migration is the best and most realistic programme for the day after the fighting ends The Gaza problem is not just our problem The world should support humanitarian emigration because thats the only solution I know But the international community including the United States has rejected the expulsion of Gazans France said We call on Israel to refrain from such provocative declarations which are irresponsible and fuel tensions However Defence Minister BenGvir was unfazed The United States is our best friend but first of all we will do what is best for the State of Israel he said UKs Rwanda Plan The Israeli scheme is akin to the 2022 UK plan to deport illegal immigrants to Ruanda also spelled as Rwanda paying the African country hefty sums to put them up As per the scheme on arrival in Rwanda the deportees would be granted refugee status If not they could apply to settle there on other grounds or seek asylum in another safe third country As per the plan the UK will pay for the accommodation and living expenses of those relocated to Rwanda for up to five years According to the BBC the UK gave BP British Pounds 40 million to Rwanda in 2022 A further BP 100 million was given in 2023 BP 50million is to be paid in 2024 and BP 50 million in 2026 So far no asylum seeker has actually been sent as the UK Supreme Court had ruled unanimously that the Rwanda scheme was unlawful In a report on the case the BBC said that the court feared that genuine refugees sent there would be at risk of being returned to their home countries where they could face harm The court also said that forced resettlement would breach the European Convention on Human Rights ECHR of which the UK was a signatory The court cited concerns about Rwandas poor human rights record In addition the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR told the Court that the Rwandan authorities had turned down all asylum claims made by people from Afghanistan Yemen and Syria between 2020 and 2022 The BBC quotes an economicimpact assessment done for the UK Illegal Migration Bill which questioned the economic rationale of the repatriation scheme It estimated that removing an individual from the UK to a third country such as Rwanda would cost BP 63000 more than keeping him or her in the UK Cases in Europe Australia and US Adamson and Greenhill give cases of TFM involving Denmark US Australia and EU The countries have engaged in proposing deals and partnerships that involve forced resettlement The EUs schemes of forced resettlement are supported by organizations such as the International Organization for Migration IOM and various private actors they note TFM schemes may have a variety of features such as conditional foreign aid packages and economic assistance along with programmes of migration control the strengthening of borders and migration management TFM deals may include population transfers and exchanges repatriations readmission agreements deportation arrangements between States and their international proxies that are designed to move people involuntarily across borders andor to forestall or prevent such movements As part of its response to the 201516 European migration crisis the EU placed renewed emphasis on the removal and return of irregular migrants and failed asylumseekers The EU introduced a temporary emergency relocation scheme which was in effect a system of mandatory population transfers of up to 160000 asylumseekers and refugees across EU member states Adamson and Greenhill say The EU has also negotiated external deals including the muchpublicized EUTurkey deal of March 2016 which included along with other measures provisions for forced returns from Greece to Turkey in exchange for Euros 6 billion in aid and an array of other concessions they point out The 2021 Joint Declaration on Migration Cooperation for Afghans provided for the return of refused asylumseekers and irregular migrants in exchange for substantial aid packages for Afghanistan But although labelled as a return deal many Afghans in Europe were second and third generations refugees born in Pakistan or Iran and had never set foot in Afghanistan Thus these negotiated return arrangements are more akin to involuntary and forced population transfers Adamson and Greenhill say Turkey had proposed the resettlement of Syrian refugees in northern Syria Ostensibly voluntary and for humanitarian purposes this programme was also motivated by Turkiyes security concerns its interest in creating a buffer zone in northern Syria in its ongoing conflict with armed Kurdish rebels Australias Pacific Solution first brokered in 2001 included bilateral agreements with Nauru that allowed for the transfer of asylumseeking migrants to Nauru as well as options for permanent resettlement The refugee deal signed in 2014 between Australia and Cambodia which set out to transfer populations directly from Nauru to Cambodia was accompanied by an AUS 40 million development assistance package and additional funds to cover resettlement costs During the infamous 1980 Mariel boatlift the United States approached an array of Central and South American countries with offers of funding inkind aid and other assistance in exchange for the relocation of some of the 125000 Cubans who had landed in the United States the authors recall In a related move at the height of the 1994 Cuban balseros crisis when there was a mass exodus of Cubans to the US the US approached 13 Caribbean and Central American countries to accept them making promises of financial payments and other concessions The US has long worked with neighbour Mexico to deter migration from Central America USfunded programmes from the late 1980s onwards led to increased deportations of migrants from Mexico to other Central American states In the 2000s the US gave US 28 billion in security aid to Mexico which was used substantially for migration control Adamson and Greenhill point out"

        "body": "Police officers checking bags of passengers travelling in long distance buses Pic by Pushpakumara Mallawarachchi Law enforcement authorities have been able to net over 29000 suspects during the past 22 days under its recently launched Yukthiya antidrug operation The main objective of this operation is to wipe drugs off the street and to establish a safer society for future generations Even though the public has extended their support to the police and security forces incidents of public strip searches and warrantless arrests too had been reported Amongst the arrestees are some 1600 suspects who have been sent to rehabilitation centres But the legal procedure to send suspects to rehabilitation centres isnt clear The remedy to bust the drug menace is with the President himself Walaliyadde In this backdrop Presidents Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadde who has been vocal on various issues with regard to the law and order in the country responded to some salient questions with regards to the ongoing antidrug operation Excerpts Q Many individuals allegedly suspected as drug addicts are being arrested and forcibly taken into custody under the Yukthiya operation News reports state that some are being sent to rehabilitation centres What is the legal procedure behind sending a suspect to a rehab centre Thousands of alleged drug addicts are being taken into custody during the Yukthiya operation And according to news doing the rounds they are being sent to rehab camps There are medical centres at these rehab camps and maybe after they are sent there the relevant examinations are done and if the results are negative they are released Considering the magnitude of the operation it would be practically impossible to file cases against each and every suspect A court case involves a B report in duplicate filing and taking the suspects to court under guard and police representation The courts would have little time for the other matters that are pending Q We recently witnessed an incident in Kurunegala where police officers were seen tying the legs of a suspect in order to take him for questioning Some made links between this incident and the George Floyd case Can the cops behave in such a manner even during a tense situation It is not quite easy to apprehend a drug addict if he knows whats happening One must remember that many of these addicts are armed with weapons So in these instances each case must be considered on its own merits before making strictures against the police who are risking their lives every day Q There are many incidents of harassment and bullying by the cops One report indicated how the cops forced a young boy to strip his pants and underwear as they found a pair of scissors in his wallet and had suspected that he is carrying them for some drugrelated purpose What are your observations in this regard In relation to harassment I saw the statement issued to the internet by the father of the victim If the statement is true then there has been a violation of the victims fundamental rights as well as the girls It is good that this type of situation is brought to public notice and stern and swift action should be taken against the officers responsible in terms of the constitution and the penal code Mere disciplinary action would be quite inadequate Q Other than the Constitution what are the other laws that protect the rights of citizens in a situation like this The Constitution grants a civil remedy to the victim whilst the penal code provides criminal action Q Do you think the masterminds behind the drug menace would be prosecuted under this operation This operation will be successful against the small time pushers if they can be caught But the police was quoted yesterday in the news saying that the main big time traffickers had fled the country They are not big time traffickers They are intermediaries because these people are not the god fathers but just minions with silly nick names The main handlers in Sri Lanka havent even been touched so far Tell the Yukthiya to summon Maithripala Sirisena for a statement and demand that he justifies his allegations made in Parliament a few years ago that he has a list of the parliamentarians involved in trafficking by naming them along with his proof It is his civic duty Tell his Excellency the President to start signing death warrants of those convicted and sentenced to death for trafficking with the final appeal dismissed by the Supreme Court And to start executing the warrants without moaning about the escalation of drug related crime the remedy is with him if not these police officers are risking their lives in vain Vague documents on rehabilitation The main objective of the Bureau of Rehabilitation bill which was presented in 2022 was to rehabilitate drugdependent persons excombatants members of violent extremist groups and any other group of persons which requires treatment and rehabilitation and various therapies in order to ensure effective reintegration and reconciliation However certain clauses in the bill are concerning as they provide powers to members of the armed forces appointment of a governing council in which the Ministry secretary is given authority to become an exofficio member while the Minister is given the authority to appoint three members the minister can also appoint one of the three members as chairperson of the council But critics opined whether this Bill presented by the then Justice Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe in Parliament on September 23 2022 was brought forward with an intent of suppressing dissent However the Supreme Court ruled that the Bill as a whole was inconsistent with Article 121 of the Constitution which states that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law On March 12 2021 former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa issued a gazette titled the Prevention of Terrorism Deradicalisation from holding violent extremist religious ideology Regulations No 1 of 2021 to rehabilitate extremists thereby sending them to rehabilitation centres for one year without them being tried by any court But the regulations did not define the term extremist In August 2021 the Supreme Court ruled that the gazette violated Articles 10 121 13 of the constitution and suspended the gazette after considering a fundamental rights petition filed against it Waste of state resources Addressing a recent gathering Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon said that drug addicts have wasted money earned by their parents and many families are facing severe economic hardships Our objective is to arrest all people who sell and distribute drugs provide them with rehabilitation and reintegrate them back into society The main aim of this operation is to enforce the law on drug kingpins in the country said Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon But former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission Ambika Satkunanathan observes that arresting drugdependent persons and sending them to compulsory treatment doesnt enable them to deal with dependence Taking to her X account Satkunanathan said that it violates human rights and is a waste of state resources Evidence shows that voluntary treatment with informed consent that is community based is most effective In Sri Lanka a study conducted by the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board NDDCB in 2018 revealed that of 170 persons 123 started reusing after forced treatment some as soon as two weeks after release According to a 2015 NDDCB study 64 started reusing and internal NDDCB data states that the recovery rate is only 2530 said Satkunanathan She further suggests that harm reduction voluntary communitybased treatment and support to families of persons with drug dependence works better Instead the government wastes state resources on a strategy that doesnt work In 2023 Rs 125 billion was allocated for the compulsory drug treatment her account read A JMO report is being obtained prior to producing suspects in courts SSP Thalduwa Responding to a query on the procedure to send drugdependent persons to rehabilitation centres Police Media Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that a judicial medical officer report is being obtained for each one of the suspects prior to sending them to courts Thereafter the courts decide whether to send them for rehabilitation or not he explained"

trio Bean ends it asserting that their absence leaves a profound void in our community Addressing the media at party office Dr Harsha De Silva and Eran Wickramaratne expressed their stance against welcoming every Tom Dick and Harry responsible for the economic downturn into their party The two most respected members in the SJB at the moment have commented on recent MPs crossing over to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya SJB emphasizing their partys reluctance to unite with those accountable for the economic downturn Dr De Silva stressed that those seeking to join their party must uphold cleanliness and be ready to align with their economic policies rather than introducing failed economic strategies The disillusioned and disgruntled former staunch Rajapaksa loyalists with hopes of mass support from the 69 million shattered and spurned by the NPPJVP are now turning to the Opposition Leader for securing nominations for the upcoming Parliamentary elections In an interview with a prominent blogger Dilan Perera a leader of one of the many divided and scattered splinter groups of Pohottu dissents revealed that they had approached JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who declined to form an alliance with them However Dissanayake has indicated their partys openness to a potential collaboration if the need arises in forming a government after the elections It seems the groups strategy involves securing victory with SJB votes and subsequently orchestrating a departure to join forces with Malimava This move aims to secure ministerial roles under Anura Kumaras leadership if SJB losses This leaked strategy has prompted Sajith while encouraging more to fall on his lap to pursue legal remedies in preventing crossovers from his party in a move akin to JRJs demand for Undated Letters of Resignations from his MPs The wellregarded Professor a renowned legal scholar in South East Asia began his political journey alongside Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 1994 However he defected to the opposition effectively bringing down her government in 2000 Subsequently he allied with his former law student Ranil Wickremasinghe to establish a government in 2001 Amidst the rising popularity of Mahinda he shifted allegiance to the Rajapaksas assuming cabinet positions leading to accepting the Chairmanship of SLPP under Basil R Eventually he was ousted after departing from Gotas leadership Presently the wellread professor a former vice Chancellor of Colombo University who is an asset to any political entity contemplates working under a rather novice leader Sajith Premadasa It seems theres a strong sentiment calling for the rejection of MPs associated with the Pohottuwa who are perceived to have misled voters and contributed to economic damage Such actions create a complex situation especially for Sajith who might be perceived as a weaker leader He must tread carefully to avoid conflicts with the loyal party members especially those representing minorities who stood by him during challenging periods There are potentially troublesome individuals seeking to join the SJB with the boss being too eager to bring all sorts of problematic cases who could finally become liabilities Being cautious about who joins is crucial to avoid having persons who might cause difficulties or harm in the future Labeling MPs like Prof GL Dr Nalaka Godahewa and Prof Channa Jayasumana as mere Tom Dick Harrys while aligning with individuals of questionable backgrounds within the party hierarchy lacks credibility It seems theres a strong sentiment calling for the rejection of MPs associated with the Pohottuwa who are perceived to have misled voters and contributed to economic damage Such actions create a complex situation especially for Sajith who might be perceived as a weaker leader He must tread carefully to avoid conflicts with the loyal party members especially those representing minorities who stood by him during challenging periods Despite the potential to create a powerful alliance merging the two factions in the Uttara Lanka and Nidahase Sabhawa why the longing for agreements with other parties Why not contest independently under their own banner and the Helicopter symbol Figures like GL Dilan Dulles Godahewa Charith Jayasumana and Gammanpila are perceived as individuals of integrity and may be viewed as products or unintended outcomes of the Bandaranaike and Rajapaksa legacies However individually they lack a significant vote base The uncertainty of politicians switching parties in Sri Lanka does certainly stand out often occurring without much scrutiny or challenge It appears to be a widely accepted practice for political survival and surprisingly it doesnt draw substantial criticism The frequency of these shifts sometimes surpasses changes in personal ideologies raising questions about the underlying motives which might prioritize personal gain over steadfast principles This trend of quickly abandoning prior political beliefs for what seems like selfserving reasons can be baffling especially when it contradicts their earlier convictions Its a unique aspect of Sri Lankan political culture that might not resonate with everyone and operates under its own set of norms and understandings Its a common observation that within a governing party differences and conflicts often arise while opposition parties tend to exhibit greater unity and harmony However its unfortunate that within the SJB clashes among its members have already arisen The party Chairman Field Marshal Fonseka himself is in disagreement with the rest in selecting the Presidential candidate Another stalwart has already formed a new political party and in anticipation of entering the fray when nominations are called for the plum post by September Dr Harsha Eran pulling in a different direction is causing internal discord that can affect the partys success in presenting a unified front on various issues apart from losing supporters confidence All these issues justify the claim for a change in leadership A change in leadership within both the SJB and NPPJVP advocating for more suitable alternatives to replace the current leaders as we have repeatedly emphasized in these columns Politicians are playing games while the collective frustration among the populace has flowed to a critical stage where feelings and dissatisfaction have peaked signaling a possibly explosive situation The government must consider the effects of excessive taxation which detrimentally affect the economy High taxes restrict economic growth limit consumer spending and hinder investment This leads to reduced job opportunities and competitiveness Overtaxation prompts public protests promotes tax evasion and weakens state revenue Amidst this

closed and then decided to write this message which was doing its rounds on social media We spent the whole of Friday January 5 at the Police station recording statements As civilians we are all in support of removing drugs off the street but that doesnt mean law enforcement officers can simply harass civilians Saram underscored However an inquiry had been launched following the incident while the Daily Mirror learned that the police officer in question had been transferred On January 3 a WhatsApp message written by one Gerald De Saram revealed another incident of alleged police brutality on two teens The incident had occurred when two youths a boy and a girl were stopped by officers at the Kollupitiya Police Station for a random check under the Yukthiya operation The family claims that the police had not only manhandled the boy but had forced him to strip his trousers and also his underwear However an inquiry had been launched following the incident while the Daily Mirror learned that the police officer in question had been transferred The Incident Even though the police officers had initially checked the threewheeler driver they had then diverted their attention to the two passengers According to Saram the police officers not only asked the two teens to get off the vehicle but they have also conducted a body check on the boy in a rough and crude manner Since they were not convinced they had dug into my sons pouch He carries his phone wallet and personal belongings including a pair of scissors Hes a basketball player and he carries a pair of scissors to cut his nails But the police officers have thought that he was carrying it for some drugrelated activity Thereafter they had taken him into a cubicle had grabbed my son by his belt and had manhandled him while ordering him to strip My son was petrified bullied and traumatized into submission Obliging to his orders my son had removed his trousers The officer who was not convinced by this had then asked him to remove his underwear as well My son was traumatized and was almost in tears As a father I cannot keep my eyes and ears closed and then decided to write this message which was doing its rounds on social media The following day I got a call from the Kollupitiya Police Station saying that an inquiry had been launched into the incident The officer who conducted the body check had been transferred but there were 34 other officers who were assisting him An official police inquiry had been launched and were waiting to see the outcome However Saram acknowledged the prompt action taken by the police to not only launch an inquiry but also transfer the officer who harassed his son We spent the whole of Friday January 5 at the Police station recording statements As civilians we are all in support of removing drugs off the street but that doesnt mean law enforcement officers can simply harass civilians he underscored The Pair of scissors smelled of Hash Kollupitiya Police When contacted Kollupitiya Police OIC C I Dushmantha said that the boy was taken in for a checking as the pair of scissors smelled of hash The officers immediately took a photo of the scissors We have been instructed to conduct a thorough body check on anybody we suspect and this includes requesting the suspect to remove his underwear Therefore we took him to a cubicle near the roadblock at Kollupitiya junction and asked him to remove his belt and checked his trousers Thereafter we asked him to remove his underwear as well Nothing was done by force and we were only following orders given to us Family Denies Claims of DrugRelated Activity Responding to claims by the Police Saram explained that the pair of scissors had a little bit of rust and dirt and denied that it was any residue from hash There is no way that my son used this pair of scissors to cut hash and the Police is trying hard to confirm it But in that case why did they release him If they had their suspicions they should have submitted the pair of scissors to the government analyst for a second opinion By the time the police officers diverted their attention to my son a number of vehicles would have easily passed that roadblock perhaps with drugs Nothing adds up and this is a clear case of harassing a young boy Saram said in conclusion Taking to his X account Public Security Minister Tiran Alles referred to the incident and said that stern action would be taken against any wrongdoers to ensure accountability and justice The family questions as to who could be held accountable when law keepers become law breakers in the country Article 11 of the Constitution states that no person shall be subject to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment Article 12 states that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law"

English would be something like this When January is born a way will dawn The birth of January in the Hindu Almanack is in midJanuary according to the Western calendar It generally coincides with the Tamil harvest festival called Pongal or Thaipongal It is usually a season of thanksgiving and celebration Amidst the atmosphere of festive joy it is also a time of individual and group reflection where the past is reexamined critically the present reassessed pragmatically and future plans renewed optimistically It is in that context therefore that this column focuses on the past present and future of Sri Lankan Tamils in this threepart article titled Whither the Ilankaith Thamizhar of Sri Lanka The objective is to briefly examine the past with the wisdom of hindsight analyse the present and present a prognosis of a potential future This evaluation at this point of time is made necessary by the prevailing predicament of the Sri Lankan Tamils It may not be an exaggeration to state that the Tamils of Sri Lanka are undergoing what is perhaps the worst phase in their postIndependence history Brutal War After gaining Independence the inability or unwillingness of Sinhala and Tamil politicians to resolve their differences and evolve an equitable model of power sharing resulted in much ethnic friction This friction escalated into war Initially it was a lowintensive guerrilla insurgency Subsequently it developed into positional warfare Ultimately it was a fullfledged war of a very brutal nature Decades of escalating war culminating in the military debacle of Mullivaaikkaal have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people civilians guerrillas and security forces The majority of civilian casualties are from the Tamil ethnicity Apart from the loss of life there has also been a large loss of limb Thousands of people have been physically affected in various ways like aerial bombardment artillery shelling landmines explosions crossfire etc A large number of those affected are physically impaired or disabled There has also been the destruction of property and economic regression Thousands of dwellings were destroyed or heavily damaged Agriculture fisheries small industry etc have been severely curtailed Educational health and transport facilities have eroded Infrastructure has been demolished Economic life has degenerated Social and cultural activity has diminished Large scale social and cultural events have decreased considerably There has been limited scope for meaningful aesthetic and creative pursuits In recent times however there are many temple festivals Schools too engage in sports and cultural activities More importantly there has been a brutalisation of society and hardening of values Much of the violence and criminal activity going on now in the north are symptomatic of a postwar society Psychological Trauma In that context one issue overlooked or ignored is the psychological trauma and stress undergone by the people during the years of war There has been very little psychological counselling The First World War was for four years The Second World War was for six years But this intensive war has gone on for decades and decades Moreover it was confined to a limited space The people have paid a huge price Mere statistics or journalistic descriptions cannot convey the abject forlorn situation facing Tamils who suffered in this war The families of disappeared the families of detainees the widows the orphans the single parent families the broken households the limbless the bedridden the poverty the ruins and the graves form together this colossal tragedy How will this waraffected impoverished people rise up from the dustheap or resurrect themselves from the ashes Largescale Migration Numerically the Sri Lankan Tamils are a depleted decaying entity Death destruction and displacement have wrought havoc The ravages of war leading to largescale migration has resulted in more than a million Tamils relocating to various parts of the world With their natural increase the Global Tamil Diaspora numbers over two million today In recent times there has been a rapid increase in Tamils going abroad Other reasons such as late marriage due to Dowry problems and a comparatively lower birth rate among more educated Tamils have also contributed to this population drop The last nationwide official census conducted in 201112 estimated the Sri Lankan Tamil population to be 2269266 The Indian Tamil population was 839504 According to the 201112 census there are 3113 247 Tamils Sri Lankan and Indian living in Sri Lanka Of these 1611036 Tamils are living in the Northern and Eastern Provinces Another 1502211 Tamils live outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces Hence the NorthEastern Tamil population in Sri Lanka may have exceeded Three and a half million had not large scale migration taken place due to the war Demography Apart from the decline in numbers there has been a qualitative and quantitative change in demography too The horrors of war and the destruction unleashed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces have resulted in thousands of Tamils moving out of these provinces and seeking new homes in other parts of the country particularly in Colombo and urban areas of the Western Province On the other hand there has been much displacement and relocation within the Northern and Eastern provinces too Many people have moved out of internally displaced camps but are yet to return to their original homes They live with relatives and friends or eke out a miserable living as squatters There has also been a trend of families moving out of villages to semiurban and urban areas This in turn has transformed the demographics of these places There are very few original inhabitants in some places and in many areas new communities of residents have evolved Militarization A profound result of the war has been the militarisation of the North and East Before the war began there were only a few army navy and airforce installations in the North and East Security personnel were essentially confined to barracks Today the situation is different There is a pervasive security force presence in almost all areas of the North and East The bitter reality is that there is little chance of this overwhelming military presence decreasing in the near future Actually there is every likelihood of a permanent military presence in certain strategic areas After decades of fighting a separatist war no government can be expected to withdraw or reduce the military presence in a very short time particularly when vocal warriors continue to beat war drums in the Tamil Diaspora Furthermore militarization is needed to alter the demographic composition of Tamil areas through state aided colonization Distinct Disconnect In short what we witness today is the sad spectacle of a proud people being reduced to deterioration deprivation and resultant despair in their own land There is a distinct disconnect between the travails and troubles of the Tamils living in areas comprising the arena of war and the chestthumping rants and raves of sections of the Tamil Diaspora and Tamil Nadu polity What is saddening now is the blatant failure of certain elements of the Tamil society to comprehend or realise the serious nature of the Tamil predicament today Like the Bourbons of France these segments seem to have learnt or forgotten nothing While the silent majority of Tamils remain passive these active sections are once again hogging the megaphone vociferously Their boasts and demands would make angels weep Their discourse is provocatively confrontational As a western diplomat observed to this writer These guys dont seem to realise that the LTTE lost the war and as a result all Tamils are in a difficult situation Power Equation The decimation of the tigers militarily has brought about an asymmetrical situation in the power equation The Tamil people have been declining in almost every sphere since July 1983 but the LTTE had gradually set up a mighty military machine As stated by this columnist in earlier articles the Tamils had descended horizontally as a people but the LTTE had ascended vertically as an armed force Now with the LTTE gone the powerless Tamils in Sri Lanka are in dire straits Had the LTTE transformed its military strength into political bargaining power at the appropriate time the Tamil people would certainly be in a better position But this did not happen and today the Tamils as a people are in a difficult situation Irredeemable Harm Hard as it may be for some Tamils to admit the Tamil people today are entirely at the mercy of the Sri Lankan state Despite lip service paid to the contrary by some the reality today is that there is no effective support internationally for the Tamil cause There are Sinhala dominated governments in Colombo and the disempowered Tamils have no effective means to influence it The LTTE by its acts of omission and commission has caused irredeemable harm to the Tamil people Sadness There is a deep sense of personal sorrow as I write this article reflecting on the past and pondering about the future It is a sadness that will not go away in a hurry It is a sadness compounded by the fact that I foresaw this evolving tragedy and cried out for a course correction to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE publicly and privately I urged the LTTE to convert their military muscle into bargaining power at the negotiating table and arrive at a federal or quasifederal settlement without pursuing the secessionist war Not only was I one of the few Tamil voices in the wilderness but was also attacked viciously by LTTE minions as a traitor and lackey and sellout for daring to speak truth to power Today what I feared greatly has come to pass What is unbearable about this tragedy is that it need not have happened Unlike the Tsunami this could have been avoided but the mad dictates of militarism coupled with an irrational unrealistic reading of the political military and diplomatic situation has plunged the Tamils into a deep deep morass Seek Answers It is in this situation that this column intends to try and seek answers to the question Whither the IlankaiThamilar of Sri Lanka This would be done in the forthcoming second and third parts of this article with the objective of realistically assessing the present plight of Sri Lankan Tamils and encourage the Tamil people to follow a pragmatic course of action that would enable the long suffering community to better their lot and regain their rightful position under the Sri Lankan sun DBS Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyarajyahoocom"

        "body": "Individuals close to the government are of the opinion that Tamil parties must collectively approach the candidate most evident to be the winner and present their case This group rejects the notion of a common Tamil candidate on the grounds that it would alienate the Tamils from the winner without burdening any obligation on him or her towards the Tamil Community Despite none of the major political parties having presented a viable programme to the country to come out of the current economic crisis and to build an economy that would weather future storms all parties are preparing for the next Presidential Election which has to be constitutionally held in September or October this year A novel turn of events this time is a proposal floating among the Tamil political parties in the north on a common Tamil Presidential candidate towards which the enthusiasm in the north seems to be mounting with Tamil media making hype over it Although Tamil politicians such as Kumar Ponnambalam and MK Sivajilingam had contested at Presidential polls in the past they were not considered nor did they claim to be common Tamil candidates In the recent past the Tamil parties voted almost enmasse to a south based Sinhalese candidate An exception was the boycott of the 2005 Presidential Election by Tamils in the Northern and Eastern Provinces which heavily influenced the result of the election and served as a milestone in the ethnic conflict of the country UNP candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe who was strongly tipped to be the winner in that election was defeated and the boycott was said to be the result of an agreement between the winner of the election Mahinda Rajapaksa and leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE Velupillai Prabakaran A video is being circulating still on YouTube in which a prominent politician was claiming that the LTTE was paid for organizing the boycott The northern and eastern Tamils voting for south based Sinhalese candidates has been mostly protest votes meaning they in fact did not want the candidate they voted for to win but they were prompted to do so in order to defeat the other main candidate This urge for the protest vote in them has been such that within months after the end of the separatist war in the Northern and Eastern Provinces at the 2010 Presidential Election they voted for General Sarath Fonseka the man who spearheaded the military campaign against the LTTE to protest against Mahinda Rajapaksa who provided the political leadership to the war against the Tamil rebels Similarly it was Maithripala Sirisena who rode on the strength of the UNP who was the Tamils choice at the 2015 Presidential Election again a protest vote against Mahinda Rajapaksa However current dialogue among the Tamil parties on the common Tamil candidate is not aimed at protesting or supporting any specific south based candidate but in order to showcase the strength and value of Tamils votes while also showing the protest and frustration against the south based political parties Three proposals have been floated among the Tamils in the north in respect of the upcoming Presidential polls All three proposals suggest a common stand on the part of the Tamil political parties on the matter Individuals close to the government are of the opinion that Tamil parties must collectively approach the candidate most evident to be the winner and present their case This group rejects the notion of a common Tamil candidate on the grounds that it would alienate the Tamils from the winner without burdening any obligation on him or her towards the Tamils Pressing the main candidates to negotiate with Tamil leaders and commit themselves to the Tamil demands by fielding a common Tamil candidate who has the collective support of all groups of Tamils is another proposal A third proposal suggests boycotting the Presidential Election to show the world that Tamils are no longer prepared to be hoodwinked by the Sinhalese leaders However Ilangai Thamil Arasu Katchi ITAK the main Tamil party with the largest support base in the north observes that it was too early to decide a course of action on the Presidential Election The leader of the Tamil National Alliance TNA R Sampanthan had told that this was a decision that has to be taken when the situation on the ground is clearly known State Minister S Viyalenthiran who promotes the idea to support the possible winner in the Presidential Election is of the view that Tamil people have long been supporting unsuccessful candidates after which they find it difficult to approach the winner to get anything done The constituent parties of the TNA except the ITAK have left the alliance and three of them the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front EPRLF Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation TELO and Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam PLOTE have formed a new alliance called Democratic Tamil National Front DTNF with the Tamil Democratic Party TDP and the Democratic Militants Party DMP which is a grouping of former LTTE cadres They are the proponents of the common Tamil candidate EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran recently argued in a statement that no candidate in the south would be able to get the mandated 50 percent of valid votes this time which would press them to seek the assistance of the minorities He contends that the Tamil leaders against this backdrop must use the more than six hundred thousand Tamil votes as a unified tool to get the Tamil demands met This would also help show the world that Tamils do not accept any Sinhalese candidate Tamil leaders must bring the Sinhalese candidates into their agenda with the strength of the unified voice of the Tamil people However he did not explain as to how they could bring the Sinhalese candidates into their agenda by voting enblock to a Tamil candidate Parliamentarian and the former Chief Minister of the Northern Province CV Wigneswaran addressing media on December 21 welcomed the common candidate move and expressed his willingness to contest if all Tamil parties endorse his candidature It is the Tamil National Peoples Front TNPF formerly the All Ceylon Tamil Congress ACTC led by Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam that vehemently promotes the idea of boycotting the Presidential Election He told media in Batticaloa on December 27 that no Sinhalese politician would resolve problems faced by Tamils and hence Tamils must show the world that they are no longer prepared to be hoodwinked It is ironic that one Tamil leader wants to field a common Tamil candidate to show the world their resolve not to be hoodwinked while another wants to boycott the election to show the same Although the ITAK is undecided on the matter Parliamentarian Shanakiyan Rasamanickam of the party views a conspiracy in the moves to put forward a Tamil candidate His contention is that President Ranil Wickremesinghe was behind the move since there is not even a remote possibility of Wickremesinghe winning and thus he wants to prevent Tamil votes ending up in the hands of any of his rivals However the allegation by Tamil parties that Sinhalese leaders are not prepared to accept their demands is a fact The latter feel meeting primary Tamil political demands such as remerging of the Northern and Eastern Provinces creating a federal form of governance while renouncing the unitary nature of the country and investigating into human rights violations allegedly committed by the armed forces during the war would be politically suicidal for them in spite of the merits or demerits of those demands Despite some Sinhalese leaders showing courage to promise to implement certain controversial issues they never materialize The best case in point was former President Mahinda Rajapaksas pledge to implement his famous Thirteen Plus formula in 2019 It was during the Presidential Election campaign of his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa that twice President Rajapaksa gave that promise to a group of Tamil party leaders However within the first fortnight into his Presidency the younger Rajapaksa declared his aversion even to the very concept of devolution leaving the Tamil leaders who supported him to have egg on their faces A major issue that prevents both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders to arrive at an agreement on the ethnic issue is that both groups take advantage of the conflict and disagreements in the backdrop of rivalries within both communities"

        "body": "Overall the introduction of the 18 VAT on gold and jewellery in Sri Lanka is likely to have a mixed bag of observations While it could generate revenue for the government it also carries the risk of increasing gold prices reducing demand and impacting individuals and communities Its important to monitor the situation closely and assess the longterm impacts on the various stakeholders involved Policymakers might need to consider adjustments or support mechanisms to mitigate negative consequences As of January 1st 2024 both the import of gold coins and the supply of locally manufactured jewellery are subject to a Value Added Tax VAT of 18 in Sri Lanka This is a significant change from the previous regulations which exempted these items from VAT Heres a Breakdown of the New VAT Rule and its Implications What it means For Importers of Gold Coins Any gold coins imported into Sri Lanka after January 1st 2024 will be subject to an 18 VAT on top of the customs duty and any other applicable taxes For Manufacturers and Sellers of Locally Made Jewellery All locally manufactured jewellery sold after January 1st 2024 will be subject to an 18 VAT This means that jewellery manufacturers and sellers will need to account for this additional cost when pricing their products They may choose to absorb the cost pass it on to customers through higher prices or a combination of both Implications Customers The price of gold coins and locally manufactured jewellery is likely to increase due to the new VAT This could impact consumer demand for these items Businesses Jewellery manufacturers and sellers will need to adjust their accounting and pricing practices to comply with the new VAT regulations They may also need to educate their customers about the price increase Government The new VAT is expected to generate additional revenue for the Sri Lankan government Additional Points to Consider The specific rules and regulations surrounding the VAT on gold coins and jewellery may vary depending on the type of product its value and other factors Businesses should consult with a tax adviser to ensure they are complying with all applicable requirements The impact of the new VAT on the gold and jewellery market in Sri Lanka is still uncertain It is possible that the market may adjust to the new tax over time but it is also possible that the VAT could have a negative impact on the industry The inability to claim input tax credit under the new VAT regime will significantly impact both jewellery businesses and customers Impact on Jewellery Businesses Reduced Profit Margins Jewellery businesses cannot import jewellery and therefore are unable to get Tax Invoices for their original gold purchases from the Central Bank and other authorized importers Thereby they are unable to offset the 18 VAT they pay on inputs against the VAT they collect on output jewellery sales This effectively increases their cost of production squeezing their profit margins Increased Administrative Burden Businesses need to maintain separate records for VATexempt VATliable and excluded supplies and transactions adding complexity and cost to their accounting processes Competitive Disadvantage Jewellery businesses in Sri Lanka now face a competitive disadvantage compared to those in countries with lower VAT rates or input tax credit mechanisms This could affect exports and attract competitors from less burdened markets Reduced Investment and Growth The squeezed margins and increased complexity may discourage investment in the jewellery sector hindering both its growth and potential job creation Impact on Customers Higher Jewellery Prices To maintain profitability businesses are likely to pass on the increased cost of production due to the unclaimable input tax by raising jewellery prices This could make jewellery less affordable for some customers Reduced Demand Higher prices could lead to decreased demand for jewellery impacting business revenue and potentially leading to job losses Shift to Informal Market Customers seeking to avoid the higher prices may turn to the informal market where VAT regulations may not be strictly enforced This could lead to concerns about authenticity quality and consumer safety Overall the inability to claim input tax credit creates a significant burden for jewellery businesses and presents challenges for customers Its crucial to closely monitor the impact of this policy and consider potential adjustments to mitigate its negative effects on the industry and its customers Here are Some Potential Solutions that could be Explored Implementing an input tax credit mechanism This would allow businesses to claim credit for the VAT paid on inputs for their Gold purchases from the Central Bank and other authorised importers reducing their overall tax burden and potentially stabilizing prices Reducing the VAT rate on jewellery A lower VAT rate could lessen the impact on both businesses and customers although it would also generate less revenue for the government Providing targeted support to the jewellery industry This could include tax breaks access to loans or other initiatives to help businesses cope with the increased costs and adapt to the new regulations By carefully considering the potential solutions and their implications policymakers and industry stakeholders can work together to minimize the negative effects of the new VAT regime and ensure the continued growth and prosperity of the Sri Lankan jewellery sector The Introduction of the 18 VAT can lead to Various Observations on Different Levels Market Level Increased Gold Prices The immediate and most visible impact will be a rise in gold prices This is due to the additional cost burden placed on the gold supply chain from import to retail Reduced Demand for Gold Higher prices might deter some customers from buying gold causing a potential dip in demand This could lead to lower revenue for importers and retailers If the demand falls businesses might experience reduced revenue and profits Shift Towards Alternatives Customers might turn to cheaper alternatives like silver or costume jewellery Possible Black Market Activity In extreme cases high prices and limited access could incentivize informal markets for gold trading posing concerns about authenticity and regulations Individual Level Reduced Household Investment in Gold Gold is traditionally seen as a safe haven investment in Sri Lanka The higher cost might discourage individuals from allocating funds to gold impacting their investment portfolios Impact on Different Income Groups The price increase is likely to disproportionately affect lowerincome groups who rely on gold as a savings or gifting option Social Level Potential Job Losses If the gold industry experiences a downturn due to lower demand job losses in related sectors like jewellery making could occur Impact on Cultural Practices Gold plays a significant role in Sri Lankan cultural practices especially weddings and religious ceremonies Increased prices could make these traditions more expensive and potentially limit participation for some Government Level Increased Revenue The new VAT is expected to generate additional income for the government potentially aiding in its economic recovery efforts Challenges in Policy Implementation Ensuring effective enforcement of the new regulations and preventing tax evasion in the gold trade could pose challenges for the government Overall the introduction of the 18 VAT on gold and jewellery in Sri Lanka is likely to have a mixed bag of observations While it could generate revenue for the government it also carries the risk of increasing gold prices reducing demand and impacting individuals and communities Its important to monitor the situation closely and assess the longterm impacts on the various stakeholders involved Policymakers might need to consider adjustments or support mechanisms to mitigate negative consequences and ensure sustainable growth for the gold and jewellery sector in Sri Lanka The Possibility of Increased Overseas Purchases of Gold and Jewellery could have Significant Consequences Consequences for the Sri Lankan Government Reduced Revenue If a significant portion of gold and jewellery purchases shift overseas the government will lose out on the potential VAT revenue from these transactions This could impact government budgets and limit spending on essential services Loss of Foreign Exchange Earnings As more purchases happen abroad foreign exchange earnings from the jewellery industry could decrease This can impact the countrys Balance of Payments and exert pressure on the currency Negative Impact on Trade Balance The shift away from local purchases could widen the trade deficit further impacting the countrys economic stability Consequences for Jewellery Businesses Reduced Sales and Profits With customers opting for cheaper options abroad domestic jewellery businesses will likely face a decline in sales and profits This could lead to job losses As businesses struggle financially job cuts and economic hardship within the industry become more likely Business Closures In severe cases some businesses might be forced to close down further shrinking the industry and impacting livelihoods Reduced Investment The overall downturn in the industry could discourage new investments and hinder its growth potential Additional Points to Consider Impact on Tourism The decline in the jewellery industry could also negatively affect tourism as Sri Lanka loses its appeal as a shopping destination for gold and jewellery Growth of Informal Market As customers seek cheaper options the informal market for gold and jewellery might flourish posing challenges for tax collection and consumer protection Longterm Repercussions The consequences of this shift could have longterm repercussions for the Sri Lankan economy employment and the overall competitiveness of the jewellery industry Possible Solutions and Mitigating Factors Reviewing the VAT Policy Revisiting the 18 VAT rate and considering implementing an input tax credit mechanism could potentially stabilize prices and incentivize local purchases Boosting Domestic Industry Competitiveness Government initiatives that improve efficiency reduce production costs and enhance the marketing of Sri Lankan jewellery could make it more appealing to local customers Promoting Tourism for Jewellery Focusing on unique aspects of Sri Lankan jewellery craftsmanship and heritage could attract tourists seeking alternative and authentic options Creating a Fairer Tax Environment Ensuring efficient tax collection and preventing unfair competition from the informal market can help level the playing field for domestic businesses Ultimately the shift towards overseas purchases due to the new VAT poses a serious challenge for both the Sri Lankan government and its jewellery industry Addressing this issue requires careful analysis effective policy adjustments and collaborative efforts to maintain the sectors viability and prevent its negative consequences on the economy and local communities Predicting the near future in complex situations like this requires considering several factors and potential developments Here are some possible scenarios based on the current situation and potential responses Scenario 1 Gradual Adjustment and Adaptation Customers gradually adjust to higher prices Over time some customers might adjust to the higher prices and continue buying domestically especially for culturally significant occasions Jewellery businesses adapt Businesses might find ways to optimize their operations source materials costeffectively and improve marketing to become more competitive Government reviews the policy The government might decide to revise the VAT rate or implement alternative measures to address the concerns of businesses and customers Overseas purchases remain significant However a sizable portion of purchases might still occur overseas impacting government revenue and the domestic industry Scenario 2 Increased Shift to Overseas Purchases Customers actively seek cheaper options abroad If price differentials remain high the trend of overseas purchases could intensify especially for bulk buys or luxury items Domestic jewellery industry faces decline Businesses could experience significant sales and profit losses leading to job cuts closures and reduced tax revenue for the government Informal market thrives The demand for cheaper options might boost the informal market for gold and jewellery raising concerns about authenticity and regulations Government considers stronger action The government might implement stricter controls on gold imports or introduce further measures to incentivize local purchases Scenario 3 Policy Change and Industry Revival Government implements significant policy changes If the negative consequences become severe the government might choose to significantly reduce the VAT rate or consider input tax credit mechanisms Domestic industry regains competitiveness With a more favourable tax environment and increased government support the domestic jewellery industry could regain its footing and attract customers back Overseas purchases decrease As local prices become more competitive the shift towards overseas purchases might lessen benefiting the domestic industry and government revenue Longterm growth and sustainability Through effective policy adjustments and industry adaptation the Sri Lankan jewellery sector could achieve sustainable growth and remain competitive in the long run Ultimately the near future depends on the interplay of various factors including consumer behaviour industry adjustments and the government response to the emerging situation Carefully monitoring the situation analyzing data and adapting to changing realities will be crucial for navigating the challenges and maximizing the potential benefits of this evolving landscape The writer is a Chartered Accountant Tax Management Consultant and a Managing

Countries Foreign Affairs Ministers adopted in Lima in August 1975 most severely condemning Zionism as a threat to world peace and security and calling upon all countries to oppose this racist and imperialist ideology The resolution declared that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination Zionism is Israels state policy and it seeks to establish a Jewish state in what was Biblical Israelfrom the Nile in Egypt to the Euphrates in Iraq encompassing Palestine Syria Lebanon Jordan parts of Egypt northern Saudi Arabia and a portion of Iraq Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl who was regarded as the father of Zionism explained the concept in his book The Jewish State in 1896 It won wide acceptance at the first congress of the World Zionist Organisation in Basle Switzerland in 1897 Since then the movement has achieved what it wanted through intrigues shenanigans treachery terrorism and the hijacking of Judaism Zionism even played decisive behindthescenes gamechanging roles in the two world wars When the USsponsored Resolution 4686 was presented in 1991 most NAM states in deference to the sole superpower voted for it or abstained After all the 1975 resolution 3379 was spearheaded by mostly NAM nations Most Arab and Islamic countries voted against the resolution arguing that Israel was continuing its atrocities against the Palestinians in occupied territories Joining the Arab and Islamic countries were four other nonMuslim nations Sri Lanka North Korea Cuba and Vietnam Sri Lanka took the moral high ground in support of the Palestinians right to statehood and freedom and insisted that Zionism was indeed a form of racism Despite Sri Lankas no vote Resolution 4686 was passed enabling Israel a pariah for NAM till then to make its diplomatic presence felt in many African and Asian nations But many of them were soon to learn that Israels atrocities only became worse in the Palestinian territories Sri Lankas president at the time was Ranasinghe Premadasa One of his presidential election pledges in 1988 was to sever relations with Israel His predecessor President J R Jayewardene had established limited ties with Israel and opened an Israeli liaison office in the US embassy largely to facilitate military supplies from the Zionist state This was after Washington said it could supply weapons to Sri Lanka only with Indias consent which was then unthinkable given New Delhis open support for Sri Lankas separatist rebels Sri Lanka was to later learn that the Israelis were not only training Sri Lankan troops but also the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE as revealed by Victor Ostrovsky a former Mossad officer in his 1991 bestseller By Way of Deception The Premadasa governments decision was a continuation of the postindependence foreign policy that had a moral compass although some may claim it was all about winning Muslim votes and wooing the Arab world for aid Even the Jayewardene government had a principled foreign policy concerning Israel though the civil war in 1983 pushed it to maintain military ties with the Zionist entity In 1979 when Sri Lanka was billed to play a cricket match against Israel at the International Cricket Councils Associate Members tournament to qualify for the World Cup the Jayewardene government advised the Sri Lanka cricket team to skip the match But today Sri Lanka is playing Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in foreign policymaking visvis Israel It votes for UN resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza but at the same time sends thousands of Sri Lankan workers to support Israels war economy It should be noted here that with regard to Apartheid South Africa Sri Lanka strictly implemented the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement according to which Commonwealth nations were required to sever sporting ties with the white supremacist regime Just as it was morally incorrect to have any ties with Apartheid South Africa it is with apartheid Israel Would we have sent tea donations to Rwanda when the Hutus were massacring the Tutsis in 1914 or to the Serbian ultranationalists when they were committing genocide against Bosnians in 1995 If we had a government of our own during World War II would we have sent labourers to Nazi Germany to help it meet the labour shortage created by the extermination of the Jews The decision to send Sri Lankan workers to Israel was morally reprehensible It helps Israels genocide Sri Lankan agriworkers take the place of Israeli farmers who join the army and kill Palestinian babies in Gaza Going after a few shekels while trashing principles is akin to selling Lankas collective soul In contrast South Africa stands tall in world politics It has brought Israel before the International Court of Justice for a ruling that what Israel is doing in Gaza is genocide and a crime against humanity If there is a global morality index South Africa would certainly be at the top Sri Lanka with its Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde foreign policy is somewhere in the middle and the bottomranking nation will be the morally bankrupt United States of America together with Israel And now Sri Lanka wants to send a naval ship to the Red Sea to protect merchant ships from Yemens Houthi forces who are doing their part to stop the genocide in Gaza The Houthis are largely targeting vessels going to and coming from Israel or owned by Israel By confronting the Houthis isnt the government extending tacit support to Israeli genocide or expressing solidarity with the proIsraeli Western alliance that is now policing the Red Sea at a time when the conflict in Gaza is threatening to spread regionwide Playing Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as regards the IsraeliPalestinian issue is nothing new In 2006 on the instruction of the foreign ministry Sri Lankas envoy gave a slip during a crucial UN vote to condemn Israels atrocities in occupied Palestine The Sunday Times aptly headlined the story Flushing the Palestinian cause down the UN toilet as Sri Lankas envoy was said to have left the chamber to answer the call of nature"

employees launched an island wide strike demanding a Rs 20000 monthly pay increase They also called for the reestablishment of a pension scheme denied to all public sector employees recruited over the past six years An ILO report titled Building a High Quality Public Service in Sri Lanka through Workplace reform describes the public service as a major employer in Sri Lanka engaging some 14 million people The productivity affordability and reliability of its services are critical to the health wellbeing and socioeconomic progress of the country However the delivery of those services is impaired by inadequate systems low skills and limited competencies and is often interrupted by strike action However its a known fact that public sector employees are entitled to many perks allowances and facilities in addition to a pension upon retirement But with employees taking days and months to complete a task members of the public have started questioning the efficiency of the public service over the past few years In 2022 the Cabinet of Ministers approved the appointment of a committee to identify priorities in essential recruitments Despite such inefficiencies incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to the island wide strike launched by public sector employees last year in a positive manner In his 2024 Budget Speech President Wickremesinghe said that 35 of the government revenue is spent on the salaries of public servants and on social welfare He proposed to increase public sector salaries while increasing their Cost of Living Allowances A government employee would therefore receive Rs 17800 as the Cost of Living Allowance while the Cost of Living Allowance for public pensioners would increase to Rs 6025 In response to an RTI request filed to the Department of Management Services to inquire about the existing cadre vacancies salaries perks and benefits of public sector employees the Department said that the Approved cadre for the public sector as at December 31 2022 is 1715417 and the existing cadre is 1393883 The breakdown of cadre positions in different institution categories and respective vacancies are mentioned table 1 When inquired about salary scales applicable to the public sector employees Information Officer MDIB Gamage said that there is no average salary scale mentioned for public service Salaries of public sector employees are paid according to the Public Administration circular 032016 dated 25022016 The salary code points various grades and several other factors add up when preparing salaries of public sector employees In addition they are also entitled to allowances pension station and overtime allowances said Gamage Responding to a query on perks leave and other benefits entitled to by public sector employees Gamage further said that the relevant circulars are issued by the Secretary Ministry of Public Administration Home Affairs Provincial Councils and Local Governments For instance the provision of a monthly allowance of Rs 5000 to employees in commercial corporations statutory boards and government owned companies was granted via a circular issued by the Department of Public Enterprises dated January 18 2022 the implementation of official language policy and payment of incentives for the officers of public corporations statutory boards state banks and fully owned government companies via a circular issued by the Department of Management Services 012023 dated January 19 2023 payment of professionals allowances for the senior level officers of corporations statutory boards and fully government owned companies provision of transport facilities for the officers in commercial corporations statutory bodies and state owned companies via a circular issued by the Department of Public Enterprises

timelines and making appropriate recommendations for the public sector to carry out their duties effectively However a senior official at the Ministry of Public Administration Home Affairs Provincial Councils and Local Government said that different state sector employees are being recruited by different departments Be it Grama Niladharis development officers management assistants drivers etc each

        "body": "Sri Lanka staggered through much of the last year but emerged better than expected Considering the challenges of yesteryear when the inflation was running at 70 per cent and popular scare mongers were threatening the capture of the state this year should be a cakewalk Though by no means challenges ahead are inconsequential they are manageable However Sri Lankans have a knack for taking things for granted That should make one worry that this could be the makeorbreak year the year that could decide where the country will be in five to ten years Economy A few factors stand out Firstly the economic recovery recorded since the third quarter of 2023 may go on until the second half of this year In part because the economy that had shrunk during the corresponding quarters of the last year may record a catchup growth But then when a longterm probusiness policy and much awaited economic reforms are needed to generate longterm economic growth the election fever would engulf the country For the second half of this year economic populism and the pieinthesky promises will overwhelm any economic common sense Some have already threatened to walk back on the IMF program without divulging their magic formula for the alternative course of action Such selfseeking stupidity would gain credence and dampen investor interests Economic recovery beyond the second half of this year is not guaranteed and feuding politics and street protests generally led by usual culprits would make it extra hard Politics Secondly Sri Lanka does not have a viable alternative government at the moment Popular disgruntlement has led to extreme polarization and choices far more destabilizing than the current status quo The JVPNPP rides on a wave of popular despair by simply regurgitating these grievances They offer no solutions and do not seem to think that is necessary either A JVP success at elections would lead the country into an uncertain future at its mildest it would be as devastating as Sirimavo Bandaranaikes quasisocialist government of 197077 that sucked out the last remnants of the competitive advantage of the postcolonial economy But for a population preached by economic cavemen that Sirimavo did wonders and had her policies continued Sri Lanka would have produced miracles such a suicidal level of economic populism does not register The other alternative political force SJB which could form a viable government in association with the UNP is obsessed with its petty differences with Ranil Wickremesinghe Such obsession may pave the way for its electoral annihilation as it had been before when it ran against Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the Pohottuwa Thus Sri Lanka is staring at an uncertain future Choices before us are not the most optimum but some are far more destructive than others Unless a credible and common sense political alliance evolves Sri Lanka risks committing a blunder reminiscent of electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa to power four years back China Thirdly there are external factors Much of the rich world economy avoided a recession last year Now that the worst days are behind the Federal Reserve will likely cut the interest rates this year This would result in a return to economic growth in many Western economies though the growth will be uneven Sri Lankan exports that have declined might pick up However its dependency on garments and lowend migrant workers as prime sources of foreign remittance for over three decades is as degenerative as anything can get Elsewhere China which has been Sri Lankas largest development partner has not recovered from the postCOVID economic slump it too is entering an uncertain future saddled by a property bubble high youth unemployment and worsening bilateral rivalry with the USA Though the Chinese loan bonanza has run out Sri Lanka has been counting on Chinese FDI for the Colombo Port City and Hambantota Port Economic Zone The slowing Chinese economy could constrain such investments The excesses on the Belt and Road Initiative are currently being trimmed Sri Lanka will have to diversify its development partners urgently however businessfriendly legislation and land labour and trade reforms requisite to generate investor appetite would be lost in the populist dogmas of election slogans Security Fourth is a matter of national security The world is entering the year 2024 with two highintensity wars Russians in Ukraine and Israel in Gaza Both will go on for much of 2024 or beyond The Israeli campaign in Gaza is fueling emotions in the Muslims and risks their radicalization Sri Lankans should not have misgivings that their own would be insulated The Easter Sunday attacks and a wave of Arabization and Islamization leading to them revealed that such ignorance would be paid with lives Therefore renewed intelligence cooperation with foreign counterparts and domestic surveillance is a precaution Probably on this count President Ranil Wickmeresinghes pledge to allow Maulavis from Egypt and textbooks from the Gulf for local Madrassas would not help That is while countries for instance France have stopped letting in foreign accredited Imams in order to ward off the overarching influence of Islamism Sri Lanka ceased the acceptance of foreign imams and began the vetting of Islamic textbooks after the Easter Sunday attacks Mr Wickremesinghe may be aiming at the Muslim votes but the majority of local Muslims have far more pressing concerns shared by their peers of other faiths Therefore the President is trying to empower the wrong kind That would be a dangerous gamble Finally if Sri Lanka is to have a real shot at the future it should invest in what it has abundantly and in a reasonable form human capital Instead we are exporting the lot to the Middle East in the form of housemaids and lowskilled workers A forwardlooking government would have retrained them in economically rewarding skills and found betterpaid destinations Our higher education policy is cannibalizing the future of four in every five youths who qualify for university An industrious government would have prioritized building a network of universities with private sector cooperation and also invite the reasonably positioned global universities to open colleges in Sri Lanka Then it would cut the investment red tape make it easier for global companies to invest in Sri Lanka and rescue the public from local wheeler dealers milking this captive market One would hope that even a fraction of these notsogrand ambitions could be achieved this year Follow

thereby squashing the hopes of refugees in Sri Lanka a protester representing Rohingya refugees in Sri Lanka told media personnel at a protest held on January 2 Tuesday near the UNHCR office in Colombo The protester didnt wish to be identified in the glare of the media for safety reasons It was the dawn of a new day and though the sun was shining on these Rohingya refugees the promise that the morning brightness brought was not enjoyed by these protesters due to the presence of fear and the bleak futures associated with their lives The hope that the New Year brings others was not applicable to these people because their lives are faced with a decisive moment About 20 Rohingya refugees protested in front of the UNHCR office in Colombo holding boards in their hands One such board read We are the victims of an unclear future Speaking to the Daily Mirror a youngster who is fifteen years old said that his parents had died in Myanmar He posed the questioned what his future would be without UNHCR He asked for support from the public I was afraid to attend the protest but I have the confidence to fight for my rights the boy added He too wished to remain anonymous One of the refugees at the protest site thanked the Government of Sri Lanka GoSL by saying We thank the Sri Lankan Government from our hearts because they helped us from the beginning Our destination was somewhere else but the Sri Lankan Navy rescued us He still harbours hope that the Sri Lankan people and their government would support them in the future as well He said that he had fears about his future because the UNHCR office was folding up operations here He reiterated that they Rohingyas are stateless people Moreover this individual said that members of his community are actually not living but surviving Also he stressed that if the UNHCR is closing down operations it must resolve the Rohingya refugee issue before leaving Sri Lanka He demanded a durable and viable solution to the refugee issue from the UNHCR He made a request to other embassies like the US Embassy to intervene and solve their problem One of the refugees who is currently in Panadura said that he came to Sri Lanka in 2015 He had come to Sri Lanka with two friends He mentioned that one friend had passed away in Sri Lanka due to a health issue The UNHCR looked after him but I cant say that it was enough he said According to him the refugees usually have one meal per day After struggling for about one and half years in Sri Lanka he has managed to obtain his refugee certification Our life is similar to a house without any door and window he complained He underscored of the need to escape from this dark life He said that when it comes to the issue of schooling for these children the UNHCR gave only stationary and uniforms He said that when compared to the situation he had faced in Bangladesh he felt safer in Sri Lanka and added that he has received more education and medical facilities in Sri Lanka when compared to what Bangladesh offered refugees He also spoke about housing issues in Sri Lanka and added that house agreements with officials had come to end We were afraid to attend the peaceful protest but before you die at least you have to do something to protect your basic human rights The death is closing in on us he said Lawyer Suren Perera Suren D Perera a Human Rights lawyer told the Daily Mirror that these refugees didnt intend to come to Sri Lanka and were expected to go from Bangladesh to Indonesia So they Rohingyas never came to Sri Lanka The Sri Lankan Navy went to the sea and brought them here He explained the background to the problem associated with these refugees He said that there was a case against them at the Mallakam Magistrate Court in Jaffna After that these refugees were sent to the Mirihana Detention Camp in December 2022 They have UNHCR certificates as refugees They were here until now Suddenly UNHCR decided to make their exit from Sri Lanka They were getting some allowances from UNHCR That is how they survived in Sri Lanka After the UNHCR exits Sri Lanka all these facilities are going to stop They want UNHCR to have a plan for them They want Sri Lankan Government to take responsibility regarding them because they are the ones who brought them here After UNHCR leaves Sri Lanka the Sri Lankan Government has to take the responsibility of these refugees or else the UNHCR should have a plan for them added Perera Also Perera explained the legal background connected to these refugees He added that the Government of Sri Lanka has to facilitate the refugees stay here in the island until UNHCR resettles them in another country as a permanent measure Prominent human rights activist Ruki Fernando told Daily Mirror that this community representing the Rohingya refugees had to return to the same venue after their last protest in May 2023 He said that he and some of the other activists had discussions with UN resident coordinator in Sri Lanka in 2023 regarding this issue but there was no solution to their problems We made requests to make sure that a permanent resettlement process will continue and no one will be abandoned This government doesnt offer permanent resettlement Nothing seems to have happened between May and December in terms of assuring refugees about permanent settlements education and healthcare added Fernando Fernando said that Rohingya refugees are stateless He said that the Government of Sri Lanka must take some responsibility regarding this issue because of the growing global refugee crisis He sees some positivity in this issue because the Government of Sri Lanka allowed these refugees to settle in this country temporarily Relatively this is a very small number of people Globally there are millions of refugees added Fernando He maintained that some of the refugees had told with him that they like to settle down in Sri Lanka because they feel safe in this country He also stressed that the Sri Lankan hospitality would be tested in how they treat people from vulnerable communities Attorneyatlaw Lakshan Dias shared his opinions and some of his past experiences regarding the refugees He recalled how Sri Lankans are living as refugees in other countries Dias said that it was unclear to him as to how UNHCR will operate from 2024 onwards in Sri Lanka They have told us that there will be no assessments done on these refugees in Sri Lanka From 2024 onwards these refugees are on their own added Dias He referred to what had happened to the UNHCR office in Hong Kong an incident he had witnessed In 2005 in Hong Kong the UNHCR did the same There they moved out from their office We were in Hong Kong at that time and had no option but to search for other options The Hong Kong Government was part of UN CAT and article 3 of UN CAT was applicable If anybody tortured citizens of their country of their origin they could live in Hong Kong Dias said that since these refugees dont have any local laws supporting them they might have to depend on Sri Lanka and well wishers Newcomers to Sri Lanka as refugees and asylum seekers will have no opportunity to seek asylum They have to seek supports from the Sri Lankan Government The Government of Sri Lanka does not have any laws supporting refugees who arrive here said Dias So where are they supposed to go There is no UNHCR no government strategies no government ministry or department to look after them and no laws to cover this issue They only have one option and that is to go before courts to seeking their fundamental rights They are human beings and they are covered under article 1011121 and 122 of the constitution he explained And the UNHCR from a global level has a sort of a reach and they can look at it as a third party and bring a settlement according to status of refugees But countries like Sri Lanka have no rights So that is why UNHCR is important But after 18 years the refugees are in a handicapped situation added Dias Also he questioned from the government how this government is going to look after them My opinion is to look after them because we have sent millions of our people to most parts of the world from 1979 onwards said Dias He added that the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry is not legally bond to speak regarding this matter But customary the international law is prevalent he said Dias warned that these refugees will start starving given the current situation in the country Some local lawyers and activists walked along with the Rohingya refugees to the UNHCR office in Colombo and handover a petition to a UN officer at the UNHCR The UN officer didnt engage himself in conversation with the refugees and their supporters The only assurance he gave was that the authorities would contact them The letter handed over to the UNHCR was signed by Rohingya refugees They had mentioned in this letter not to abandon them After that the protesters visited the Canadian and US Embassies in Sri Lanka and handed over letters One of the refugees handing over the petition to the UN officer Kiriella The petition was signed by 72 Rohingya refugees Pics by Kithsiri De Mel"

international appeal to shape events to a new level Gets The Backing Of The Central Conference On Foreign Affairs For An Aggressive Foreign Policy Stance To Face Mounting Challenges Given the sluggish recovery of the Chinese economy postCOVID and the increasingly challenging international environment Chinas President Xi Jinping has assumed a tough foreign policy stance centralizing decisionmaking in institutions he personally heads Perhaps he considers 2024 to be ideal for decisive and assertive posturing given that it is the Year of the Dragon which is said to bring luck good fortune and prosperity To take the mounting international challenges headon Xi has opted for a highly centralised decisionmaking system based on his Thought on Diplomacy His plan was backed by the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs held in Beijing on December 27 and 28 In his New Year message Xi said that mainland China will be united with Taiwan China will surely be reunified and all Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nationhe said Of course this is not the first time Xi pledged to take Taiwan He bluntly said this to US President Joe Biden during their recent summit in San Francisco though he had taken care to add that Chinas preference would be to take Taiwan peacefully He also dismissed speculations about a timeframe for it However Chinese officials had asked in advance of the summit that Biden make a public statement that the US supports Chinas goal of peaceful unification with Taiwan and does not support Taiwanese independence The White House flatly rejected the request though the US is theoretically committed to the One China policy Xi who is General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China CPC President of the Peoples Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission addressed the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs and enunciated comprehensive plans for Chinas external work for the present and coming periods A readout on the meeting said that the foreign policy path pursued so far was based on Xis Thought on Diplomacy and that it had opened new vistas in the theory and practice of Chinas diplomacy and provided the fundamental guidelines for advancing diplomacy with Chinese characteristics By following Xis thoughts China had showcased its diplomacy with Chinese characteristics and established the image of a confident selfreliant open and inclusive major country with a global vision the readout said Under Xis Thought on Diplomacy Chinas diplomacy advocated the building of a community with a shared future for mankind pointing the right direction for human society leading to common development lasting peace and security and mutual learning between civilizations China has expanded a comprehensive strategic layout and formed a wideranging highquality global network of partnerships Chinas highquality Belt and Road cooperation it said had become the worlds most broadbased and largest platform for international cooperation While doing all that China had safeguarded its security sovereignty and development interests with a firm will and an indomitable fighting spirit the conference document said Further China had taken an active part in global governance and shown the way in reforming the international system And last but not least China had strengthened the centralized unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee and brought about greater coordination in Chinas external work Diplomacy with Chinese characteristics had gained much more strategic autonomy and initiative the conference asserted China also became a responsible major country with enhanced international influence stronger capacity to steer new endeavours and greater moral appeal It was resolved that on major issues concerning the future of humanity and the direction of the world China must take a clear and firm position hold the international moral high ground and unite and rally the overwhelming majority in our world It is imperative to shoulder responsibility as China is a major country We need to advocate the spirit of independence champion peaceful development and promote global stability and prosperity the conference resolved Calling for a proactive policy it said that Chinese diplomats need to have a correct understanding of history and of the big picture and seize the initiative It is imperative to carry forward our fighting spirit We must reject all acts of power politics and bullying and vigorously defend our national interests and dignity it added The readout said that the strength of Chinese diplomacy rests on its institutions chief of which is the centralized leadership It is imperative to leverage our institutional strengths Under the centralized unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee all regions and all departments must coordinate with each other and build strong synergy On the nature of the world and the trajectory of change the communique said that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation On Chinas outlook for the future the communique said that the country will foster new dynamics in its relations with the world and raise its international influence appeal and power to shape events to a new level In this endeavour Chinas initiatives like the Global Development Initiative GDI the Belt and Road Initiative BRI the Global Security Initiative GDI and the Global Civilization Initiative GCI will play a major role the readout said The conference called for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic

development imbalances between and within countries resulting from the global allocation of resources It resolutely opposed attempts to roll back globalization and bring back unilateralism and protectionism It called for solutions to the structural problems hindering the healthy development of the world economy Economic globalization it said must be more open inclusive balanced and beneficial to all The conference asked diplomats to identify the strategic tasks of Chinese diplomacy in a more multidimensional and comprehensive manner However the central point of the conference was to make it clear that Chinas external work shall be guided by Xi Jinpings Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era and his Thought on Diplomacy in particular It was stressed that diplomats must unswervingly uphold the CPC central leaderships ultimate authority over foreign affairs conscientiously uphold the centralized unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee and further strengthen the systems and institutions for the CPCs leadership over external work All localities and departments should keep in mind the big picture and coordinate with each other to implement the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee on our external work in both letter and spirit Speaking to the South China Morning Post on the conferences decisions Zhiqun Zhu an International Relations Professor at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania said that the exercise was part of the Communist Partys efforts to further centralise decision making to highlight Xis contribution to Chinas diplomacy in the new era and to elevate Xis political status to the level of Mao Zhu further said that it was clear that Xi would call the shots on all important matters raising some concerns about whether the party had completely departed from collective leadership Also the CPCs total control over foreign affairs leaves professional diplomats with little room to manoeuvre Zhu added But Su Hao a diplomacy expert at China Foreign Affairs University which is affiliated with the Foreign Ministry had a different take on the issue According to him the centralized approach eminently suites the changing international environment Su told Shenzhen TV that the world is no longer dominated by the West Developing countries like China have risen in power and there is multipolarity In this scenario a big power like China needs to have a system geared to play a decisive role"

        "body": "Starting the New Year on a positive note is the commendable achievement of Central Bank Governor Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe over the past eighteen months that have been praised by former CB Governor Dr Indrajith Coomaraswamy who is a distinguished former Governor in the caliber of John Exter 195153 the first to hold this important position Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe has highlighted at a media briefing that the ongoing IMF program initiated last September involves continual renegotiation before each disbursement for the next four years independent of the ruling government He further stated that this flexibility allows policy adjustments crucial for securing international backing enabling adaptable economic strategies aligned with global changes essential for stability and growth Deviating from this path during the critical 10year debt restructuring period could impact debt relief decisions potentially leading to annual US 6 billion in debt repayments if support is withdrawn This is an indisputable reality that any future government should take into serious consideration High Cost Of Living The persistent challenges posed are the alarming prevalence of malnutrition among school children coupled with the crisis of the staggering rise in the cost of living which has surged by a daunting 60 percent for the average family This financial strain has led to dire consequences with approximately onefourth of schoolchildren lacking access to necessities A crucial step in this direction involves the restoration of the unjustly withdrawn Senior Citizens special rate of interest on Fixed Deposits the worst affected being nonpensioners This step is imperative to ensure financial stability and support for this vulnerable age group The absence of adequate care for the elderly compounds the challenges faced by young parents striving to prioritize their childrens nutrition and education As they navigate the complexities of daily life the lack of proper support systems further exacerbates their struggle Law Enforcement Against Drug Menace In the midst of a robust Police campaign against the narcotic trade the chief operators appointment as the acting Inspector General of Police has faced a legal challenge in the Supreme Court The petitioners allege an infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners and other citizens under Article 121 of the Constitution The authorities Police Commission or the Minister have failed in their foremost duty in respecting the recommendations of an earlier FR case judgement against the Acting IGP In an extensive 14day operation codenamed Yukthiya the Police have apprehended over 20000 suspects and over thousand wanted men making it the largest suppression in history However he is not the only senior cop who can launch a similar programme against narcotics Accusations aimed at it by critiques probably those lucky men whose children survived addiction cite contentious areas Can a male Policeman search the handbag of a suspected woman Is the language used during Police operations justified Despite their seemingly trivial nature these arguments raise unsettling doubts about the motives behind such inquiries They might suggest the involvement of powerful forces supporting the drug trade although this might not be the case These individuals might strongly advocate for Human Rights of offenders they are concerned about overcrowded prisons etc but such individuals seem perplexed when it comes to understanding the lack of respect for the rights of unfortunate drug addicts their families and other citizens indirectly affected by the escalating number of thefts and house breaking It depicts a scenario where smaller players face repercussions while influential large scale dealers evade scrutiny When debates like these arise without clear resolutions it often sparks speculation about hidden motives or vested interests in protecting drug barons In prosecutions against top offenders the situation often pits a Police officer with qualifications akin to ALevels against highly skilled legal luminaries like Presidents Counsels who hold positions in the professional associations and charge fees in the range of around three to five hundred thousand rupees per appearance This discrepancy leaves law enforcement illequipped to effectively contend with such opponents in legal proceedings against the culprits We acknowledge the lawyers right and duty to defend accused individuals in courts Its immoral for the Police higher ups or the Minister to comment on this right or raise irrelevant issues like do they issue receipts pay taxes or utilize fees obtain from drug kingpins for feeding their children Even rushing to courts to complain of notorious drug criminal Harak Kata not being provided with short eats for his snacks is quite legal and nobody can make unfair criticism against these senior lawyers Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe has highlighted that the ongoing IMF program initiated last September involves continual renegotiation before each disbursement for the next four years independent of the ruling government Deviating from this path during the critical 10year debt restructuring period could impact debt relief decisions potentially leading to annual US 6 billion in debt repayments if support is withdrawn This is an indisputable reality that any future government should take into serious consideration Elections Priority System Change Forgotten It sounds like theres a great deal of frustration and disillusionment within the political scene The Galle Face Aragalayists achieved great heights in working towards a System Change Its disheartening to note that this effort was derailed or hijacked by the JVP and its breakaway group for their own agendas Subsequently the Pohottu thugs completed the initiative by attacking the nonviolent apolitical Aragalayists Corruption and the misuse of power have further complicated matters creating a cycle that seems difficult to break However while it might seem discouraging a change can still happen It often requires persistence collective effort and the will to hold those in power accountable Engaging in constructive dialogue supporting ethical leaders and advocating for transparent governance are crucial steps toward bringing about the desired changes All Four Major Political Parties In Dilemmas The secret discussions between SJB leader and a breakaway faction of the former staunch Rajapaksa loyalist group of dissents styled Nidahas Sabhava consisting of MPs who jumped the sinking ship in 2022 failed miserably to garner the mass support base of the Pohottu voters and are in a dilemma The secret agreement has raised concerns among the second line leadership in the SJB after the unconfirmed social media news of Prof GL being assured of the Premiership in a future government by Sajith Premadasa Dr Harsha De Silva a prominent figure within the SJB and a key economist has expressed a different position directly contradicting his party leaders stance His statements suggest a belief in the necessity of moving away from inwardlooking populist and unsustainable economic policies Specifically he emphasizes the importance of not shying away from unpopular decisions such as tax increases citing the potential consequences of previous tax cuts leading to bankruptcy Its a waste of time and space to discuss SLPP dilemmas The UNP of course is struggling to reap the support of a major group that is on the fence to crossover from the SJB but hasnt been successful and are facing a similar situation to their last Parliamentary stakes It appears that the political landscape is leaning towards the NPPJVP Combine While theyre gaining momentum there seems to be a lack of a clear governing plan or strategy Pressures from intellectual groups outside the main JVP component are causing rifts leading to discussions about Dr Harini Amarasuriya potentially becoming the Presidential candidate for the alliance A Parliamentary Election preceding the Presidential Election could lead to a HUNG Parliament and back to square one in 2024

food 43yearold Nisthana Coorey real name withheld decided to leave the country for good An agent introduced by a friend promised him a job in Thailand and it was to be the post of a sales officer Having worked in the tourism industry for a long time Coorey was glad that he could work in one of the countries where millions of tourists visit every year Before he left Sri Lanka he also had an interview where he had to record a video presentation to prove his English conversational competency The father with two young children was glad about the promised foreign employment as the agent even provided the air ticket to Bangkok from where he would be picked up to start his job from the day following his arrival Coorey was relieved that he managed to escape the crisis the country and its people were going through and thought at least his family would be able to manage basic essentials with the dollars he was going to send Coorey was leaving the Katunayake International Airport with another young Sri Lankan who was also promised a similar job Getting off from the flight Coorey and the other Sri Lankan were driven on a long journey at night The driver could not speak in English and all communications had to be done with another contact who communicated via Whatsapp messages Coorey questioned him as to why he was driving so far away from Bangkok the tourist city to work in a tourism related job but this was ignored by the contact After travelling for many hours of the journey Coorey realized that he was crossing a river which looked like a boarder of two different countries Having reached a place with huge buildings in the middle of a jungle Coorey was asked to take a rest on the following day On the second day as he was getting ready to start his new job he was unaware that his job was to be a cyberslave in Myanmar run by some Chinese Human Trafficking Human Smuggling and Maritime Crimes Division of the Criminal Investigation Department CID has arrested a Chinese national and three Sri Lankans for the alleged involvement of the racket I was one of the first to go from Sri Lanka and when I see the news circulating on media now I realized this was the same place where I worked More than a year later Coorey who was fortunate to return safely in December 2022 is glad that he saved his life and came back to Sri Lanka Our job was to impersonate as women and find clients in some of the rich countries There were many Indians Bangladeshis Indonesian and a number of Latin Americans as well I met many who were tortured for various reasons including trying to escape Coorey says adding that he still has nightmares due to the mental trauma that he went through I met one person who was beaten up after hanging him with his hands There was another who was denied food and he had survived with water in the bathroom Coorey narrated with a trembling voice I was fortunate as the Sri Lankan Embassy intervened and secured my release That was also initiated with the involvement of the Indian government to free a large number of Indians who were trapped there he explained Entrapped in a huge building with computers the duty of those kept there was to make contact with rich foreigners through their social media platforms like Whatsapp Facebook Instagram etc by pretending to be sex workers They are also forced to communicate through Gay Apps and pretend to be gay Those entrapped had also been given targets to connect with a number of clients and when the targets were not met physical punishment had been enforced At present nearly 55 Sri Lankans including both male and females have been trapped in the area called Golden Triangle bordering Myanmar Thailand and Laos and nearly 5000 US dollars had been demanded by the Chinese running the cybercriminal area Paying Cyber Criminals Not A Wise Decision In my opinion I dont think we should pay money to a criminal gang which has no connection to a legitimate government What if these Sri Lankans were not released after paying the money questioned Damith Aluge from the Honorary Consulate of Sri Lanka to Laos Mr Aluge had been involved in releasing a number of Sri Lankans trapped in the Laos boarders of the cybercrime area We need to get together diplomatic mission and other international agencies to release the group of Sri Lankans he said This is a humanitarian situation We were able to save the group from the Laos region with the support of UNHRC and the International Organisation for Migration IOM Aluge had to personally get involved in the mission and at one point he had to visit the area where the Sri Lankans were entrapped Almost all the Sri Lankans mostly young have come on tourist visa and they were aware it was illegal But due to the financial constrains they were forced seek the foreign employment the officer from the Honourary Consulate of Sri Lanka said The worst situation is that some Sri Lankans were even willing to continue working in this terrible place provided they are get paid he explained Mr Aluge also said that some of those entrapped were graduates from Sri Lanka and they had been completely mislead Investigating into the international human trafficking network the Human Trafficking Human Smuggling and Maritime Crimes Division of the Criminal Investigation Department CID has arrested a Chinese national and three Sri Lankans for the
