    "The All Ceylon Bakery Owners' Association (ACBOA) has decided to reduce the price of a 450g loaf of bread and other bakery items by Rs. 10 with effect from midnight today.",
    "The association said the decision was made after agreeing to provide eggs at Rs. 35 each for bakery production. But the retail prices of butter, margarine, yeast and wheat flour have not been reduced, they said.",
    "At least 90 percent of the bakeries in the country used to sell a 450-gram loaf of bread for Rs. 150 and Rs. 160. Therefore, the association has requested the bakery owners to reduce the selling price of all bakery products by Rs. 10 from tonight. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
