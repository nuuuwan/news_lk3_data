    "Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara requested that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa be allowed one hour from 8.30 am to 9.30 am during Parliament sessions to discuss issues.",
    "\"This is a fair request. We can start the Parliament session thereafter at 9.30 am. Otherwise the allocated time is cut short,\" MP Jayasekara suggested, adding that his time was cut short from seven minutes to five minutes.",
    "\"Parliament can commence proceedings at 8.30 am, where Mr. Premadasa can sit with the Speaker and discuss his issues. Then at 9.30 am we can start off the Parliament sessions and go ahead with our routine work,\" MP Jayasekara explained.",
    "Responding to the statement, MP Harsha de Silva said that 92 minutes of debate time were lost, with both the government and opposition exceeding their permitted time allowances. \"Both sides must accept responsibility,\" Dr. de Silva said.",
    "MP Jayasekara noted that economic expert Dr. Harsha de Silva only received four minutes to make his speech during the crucial debate on Sri Lanka's economy. \"What can you elaborate in such a short time of four minutes?\" Jayasekara questioned."
