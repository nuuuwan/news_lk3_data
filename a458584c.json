    "(Reuters) - Australia on Monday said it would tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers that could halve its migrant intake over the next two years as the government looks to overhaul what it said was a \u201cbroken\u201d migration system.",
    "The decision comes after net immigration was expected to have peaked at a record 510,000 in 2022-23. Official data showed it was forecast to fall to about a quarter of a million in 2024-25 and 2025-26, roughly in line with pre-COVID levels.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked around the clock to strike the best balance in Australia\u2019s migration system,\u201d Home Affairs Minister Clare O\u2019Neil said in a statement ahead of the formal release of the government\u2019s new migration strategy later on Monday.",
    "\u201cThe government\u2019s targeted reforms are already putting downward pressure on net overseas migration, and will further contribute to this expected decline,\u201d O\u2019Neil said.",
    "O\u2019Neil said the increase in net overseas migration in 2022-23 was mostly driven by international students.",
    "Australia boosted its annual migration numbers last year to help key businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought tighter border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out of the country for nearly two years.",
    "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the weekend said Australia\u2019s migration numbers needed to be wound back to a \u201csustainable level,\u201d adding that \u201cthe system is broken.\u201d",
    "Long reliant on immigration to supply what is now one of the tightest labour markets in the world, Australia\u2019s Labor government has pushed to speed up the entry of highly skilled workers and smooth their path to permanent residency.",
    "Under the new policies, international students would need higher ratings on English tests. It will also end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay in Australia.",
    "A new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be set up with the processing time cut to one week, helping businesses recruit top migrants amid tough competition with other developed economies."
