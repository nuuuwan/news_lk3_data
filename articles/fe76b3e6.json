    "\u201cKavantissa\u201d, the largest living tusker which symbolizes the pride of the Sri Lankan elephant lineage, is reportedly facing a serious threat to his life.",
    "\u2018Kavantissa\u2019 came into the spotlight in 2012 following the tragic death of \u2018Siyambalangamuwa Tusker\u2019, which had been the most majestic wild elephant in Sri Lanka until then.",
    "However, due to human activities in recent decades, Kavantissa\u2019s traditional annual migratory route\u2014from the Kala Wewa and Balau Wewa through Galgamuwa, Thabbowa, and Wilpattu\u2014is now completely inaccessible.",
    "Similarly, water reserves such as Palukadawala, Mahagalgamuwa, and Iginimitiya, which were once part of the tusker\u2019s habitat, are increasingly being cleared by humans for cultivation and other purposes. As a result, Kavantissa has now lost much of its natural living habitat.",
    "At present, Kavantissa roams mainly around Galgamuwa and Ambanpola regions, according to environmentalists.",
    "Recently, in these areas, two elephants namely \u2018Bhathiya\u2019 and \u2018Asthika\u2019, who were part of the same herd, were killed.",
    "Meanwhile, environmentalists have observed several wounds on the left side of Kavantissa\u2019s body, suspected to be wounds from recent gunshots.",
    "Additionally, several elephants from the herd led by Kavantissa are also found with gunshot injuries to their legs.",
    "These facts, according to veterinarians and environmentalists, indicate that the tusker Kavantissa too is now facing a serious threat to its life."
