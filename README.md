I read a long rant about the online submission of taxes posted on X, formerly Twitter, on the last day for submitting income-tax returns. This was by Nisansa de Silva, a friend who teaches computer science. It was a long thread and included words such as “rage” and many other words in capitals. But the most important sentences were: “Now I understand that this is the first time they are doing this online and it is bound to be bumpy. Woe be it if they go back to paper.”

I too had spent many hours, standing in line to get my PIN, staring at the screen waiting for the system to respond, etc. I had gone through the same torturous process but strangely I experienced no rage. Was it simply because I was double my friend’s age?

Hence, any loan being granted is a measure to take that stress out of him. That requires a banker to extend a supportive hand to the borrower. If he does not do so, the prospective borrowers will be driven to the informal money lenders who will supply the needed funds more conveniently but at rates and under conditions that will not help them to sustain their businesses

However, due to the weakness of the last government and the arrest of many health department officials in the past, there has been a major setback in the process of pharmaceutical regulation, purchase and distribution.

As a result, according to the data of the medical distribution unit, there will be massive drug shortages next year.
