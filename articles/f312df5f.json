    "The United National Party (UNP) welcomed the recent Executive Order by US President Donald Trump that further reduces reciprocal tariffs on Sri Lankan goods. In a statement, the party commended the Sri Lankan Government and its negotiating team for concluding the discussions successfully.",
    "It pointed out that the order states that some trading partners \u201chave agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States.\u201d Section 2(b) specifies that the countries listed in Annex 1 will continue to face additional duties until formal agreements are signed and further orders are issued. In light of this, the UNP has called on the Government to clarify the nature of the commitments made. It urged officials to publish a detailed explanation of the agreements referenced in the order, including their scope and implications for Sri Lanka\u2019s trade and security relationship with the United States."
