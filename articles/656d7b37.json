  "original_body_lines": [
    "The people of the United States of America elected that country\u2019s 47th president on November 5, 2024. Donald Trump, who had served as the 45th president and was defeated by Joe Biden, made an unprecedented comeback, securing 312 votes of the electoral college. It left those who backed his main opponent, Democratic Party candidate and serving Vice President, Kamala Harris, in shock. After all, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York and is currently facing charges of fraud, election subversion, and obstruction.",
    "How on earth did he even get on the ballot? How on earth did he win? Are those who voted for him ignorant of his criminal record? Have they forgotten how he covered himself in ignominy in the aftermath of losing the 2020 election? These are the questions that his detractors ask.",
    "Three weeks before Trump\u2019s incredible comeback, at the other end of the planet, a far less known individual created history by becoming the first president to be elected who did not belong to established political formations that have exclusively ruled the country since 1948.",
    "Who on earth is Anura Kumara Dissanayake of Sri Lanka? Where did he come from? How on earth did this man, from the backwoods of the North Central Province trump political dynasties whose birthright it has been to govern the country? Why on earth did the majority of voters pick an untried and untested individual from a coalition formed recently?",
    "How did the leader of a Socialist party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, better known by its acronym, JVP, lift the paltry 3% share of the vote that the JVP-led coalition, National People\u2019s Power (NPP), obtained in 2020 at the General Election, to 42.31% just four years later? How did the NPP push Sajith Premadasa, leader of the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJD) to second place (32.76%) and the sitting president and five-time Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018Grand Old Party,\u2019 the United National Party (UNP) to a distant third place with just 17.27% of the vote?",
    "The above questions indicate incredulity of the same order as evident in the in-shock responses of Trump\u2019s detractors. The reasons are strikingly different, though.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake, or \u2018AKD\u2019 as he is commonly referred to, is not in-your-face like Trump is. He was not born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth. He cut his political teeth when he was still a schoolboy, joining the student wing of the JVP following antipathy to the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord signed in 1987. He survived the violent political upheavals of the late eighties and worked his way through the ranks of the JVP to become the leader of that party in 2014 and of the JVP-led NPP in 2019.",
    "The NPP was then a fringe party in Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic political firmament; AKD got just 3.16% of the votes cast. In the following year, the NPP secured 3.84% of the vote, winning just three seats in the 225-seat parliament. Today, with the party leader just having won the presidential election, the NPP is widely predicted to win a majority of seats on offer at the General Election which will be held on November 14, 2024.",
    "Now AKD is not the first \u2018outsider\u2019 to ascend the presidency. Sajith Premadas\u2019s father, former president Ranasinghe Premadasa, did not hail from Colombo\u2019s elite classes and neither did Maithripala Sirisena or even Mahinda Rajapaksa for that matter. All three, however, came up the ranks of one of the two major political forces in the country. They weren\u2019t \u2018elite\u2019 but were cosy with the elite. They were at worst tolerated but more typically accepted as safe options in reduced circumstances.",
    "In contrast, AKD is quite an incredible story and the incredulity is not misplaced, even among those who are not aligned with any of the major political parties or coalitions that ruled the country for 76 years. It\u2019s incredible because traditionally, when governments have slipped and become unpopular, the voters have opted for \u2018the other party,\u2019 apparently forgetting that they had also squandered opportunities, re-interpreted mandates and were accused of corruption and incompetence. They have, nevertheless, reinvented themselves, often using a new face to represent the party.",
    "On September 21, 2024 a significant number of Sri Lankan voters broke with tradition. Decades of economic mismanagement compounded by the pandemic led to the country becoming bankrupt in 2022. The resultant political chaos in part caused by unprecedented protests saw Ranil Wickremesinghe, the single parliamentarian of the UNP, being elected President by a parliament in disarray.",
    "Indeed his rise ought to be considered even more incredible than that of AKD. His unceremonious eviction in September was already on the cards. Widespread defections to the SJB, which had broken away from the UNP in 2020, meant that Wickremesinghe had no political machine to talk of. The rank and file had abandoned him. He had, to his credit, brought about a semblance of economic recovery but that was just not going to be enough.",
    "AKD and the NPP had diligently done the painstaking groundwork for the transition that began in September. The people themselves had had enough of power transferring from one set of incompetent rogues to another. Those who simply could not envisage an \u2018outsider\u2019 becoming president were naturally shocked.",
    "How on earth? Why on earth? These are the questions they ask. But that\u2019s not all. It is clear that the ruling classes are not just livid at the outcome but are palpably jittery about the consequences. Sri Lanka has witnessed on many occasions regime change that has left those who have either bent rules or got them bent, untouched. Such individuals have never been under any threat. There were always \u2018friends\u2019 who would take care of them. They survived. They prospered. They were the untouchables. It seems that their insurance policies have expired.",
    "They can\u2019t take it and they will not take this \u2018affront\u2019 lying down. AKD has been in office just over a month, but already he\u2019s being charged with not fulfilling election promises. He doesn\u2019t have the privilege of the typical period of grace accorded to the newly elected. He is vilified mercilessly.",
    "AKD\u2019s detractors talk about the long history of the JVP. They allude to the two failed insurrections, one in 1971 and the other in the late eighties.",
    "The JVP\u2019s history is not squeaky clean, clearly, but bloody as those insurrections were, the hands that quelled them were far more bloodied than those of the young people who had erroneously decided that armed struggle was the one option that remained. But wait, AKD wasn\u2019t leading those struggles. He was an infant way back in 1971 and in the late eighties was hardly out of his teens. His political journey began in earnest after all that was done and dusted.",
    "He has acknowledged the errors of his predecessors and the JVP and, like his fellow party members, conducted himself with dignity and a kind of civility observed only in the breach by his political opponents, both in and out of parliament.",
    "His detractors correctly point out that he has no experience in governance. Well, he was briefly a minister twenty years ago when the JVP aligned itself with the then ruling United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) but that doesn\u2019t really count. On the other hand, there is the valid response, \u2018what have the so-called experienced people delivered?\u2019",
    "The signs are clear. First, by breaking the confines of a doctrinaire Marxist party and working to create a broader coalition of like-minded individuals and groups, and, as importantly, actively seeking the advice of experts from all walks of life including the corporate sector, AKD has demonstrated that he is willing and able to listen, respect and embrace pragmatic ideas. He has not rocked any boats, except of course the vessels that have carried the corrupt and inefficient to personal and familial \u2018greatness.\u2019",
    "AKD and the JVP have abandoned the Marxist label and attempts to make it stick will simply not work. Very few who voted for the JVP were neither Marxists nor even identify the NPP as a left party. Outside of party diehards, the vast majority simply accepted the NPP as a clean party that had the political will to do longed for clean-up.",
    "AKD and the NPP did not ascend to power in ideal times but that\u2019s not atypical. Such political formations emerge from time to time when it is clear that the tried and tested have fallen short and have failed the tests. They will make their mistakes and indeed have actually said that they are aware that they aren\u2019t perfect. They have also said they will learn and learn fast.",
    "Will AKD and the NPP make a difference? Will Donald Trump be a different president this time around? Time will tell. The chances are that Trump will remain the loud-mouthed know-all that he has always been; AKD is most likely to remain the humble village lad who fervently believes that his countrymen deserve the dignity and dignified existence they have been denied for over seven decades.",
