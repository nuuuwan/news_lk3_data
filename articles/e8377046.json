    "State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar engaged in a contentious debate yesterday concerning the provision of compensation to those affected by recent floods.",
    "During a parliamentary session, MP S.M. Marikkar urged the Government to deploy Grama Seva Officers and Disaster Management Centre officials to conduct damage assessments instead of utilising university students for this purpose.",
    "In his response, Minister Tennakoon indicated that the calculation of damage estimates would require several weeks. He mentioned that while the Government had previously insured all houses in the country, it is currently facing challenges related to premium payments and the benefits returned to the citizens. Consequently, he asserted that insuring all houses is no longer feasible for the Government. Tennakoon emphasised the need to rebuild government buildings and infrastructure within the constraints of the national budget, warning against actions that could lead to economic insolvency. He assured that relief would be provided based on what the economy can sustain.",
    "Marikkar, seeking clarity, demanded to know whether the Government would indeed compensate the affected individuals. Tennekoon cautioned Marikkar against adopting a highhanded approach, affirming that the Government would not be intimidated by such tactics. He stressed that the Government has a responsibility towards the country, its economy, and its citizens, and must provide whatever assistance is possible.",
    "Tennakoon acknowledged that there had been instances of abuse within the compensation system, where individuals obtained funds without legitimate need. He assured that the Government would prevent any misuse of compensation policies.",
    "Tennakoon advised Marikkar against using the parliamentary platform for grandstanding, reiterating that the Government has already implemented measures to address the needs of the affected population. He underscored the importance of realistic and sustainable relief efforts in alignment with economic capabilities."
