    "Says President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s past is evidence he will not face an election at this juncture",
    "Assures Wickremesinghe will avoid polls and expresses uncertainty about who would come forward instead of him",
    "Claims if Wickremesinghe had any intention to contest, his behaviour would be significantly different from what it is now",
    "Despite differing opinions among Opposition parties, specifically the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), there appears to be a shared consensus that the current President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, will not be entering the fray as a contender in the upcoming 2024 Presidential election.",
    "Former MP and NPP Executive Council member Sunil Handunnetti, during a radio program recently echoed sentiments akin to those expressed by SJB\u2019s S.M. Marikkar, stating his conviction that Ranil Wickremesinghe is likely to abstain from putting forward his nomination as a Presidential candidate.",
    "\u201cThe public frequently cautions us about Ranil Wickremesinghe and his various strategies. Looking at his track record, he suffered a defeat in the 2005 election. Subsequently, he abstained from participating in the elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020. Even in 2010 and 2015, when the UNP was in a strong position, he chose not to enter the election. Considering the current significant setback the party is experiencing, is it credible to believe that he will willingly participate in an election at this juncture?\u201d Handunnetti asked.",
    "\u201cHe will certainly avoid the election,\u201d Handunnetti maintained. However, the former MP expressed uncertainty about who would come forward instead of Wickremesinghe.",
    "Handunnetti opined that if Wickremesinghe had any intention to contest, his behaviour would be significantly different from what it is now."
