  "original_body_lines": [
    "An Israeli airstrike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City early Saturday, killing more than 60 people, Palestinian health authorities said, in one of the deadliest strikes in the 10-month-old war between Israel and Hamas.",
    "The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, claiming without evidence that it hit a Hamas command center within the school.",
    "The strike on the Tabeen school in central Gaza City also wounded 47 people, the Health Ministry\u2019s Ambulance and Emergency service said. The facility, like almost all of Gaza Strip\u2019s schools, has been used as a shelter for people who have been forced to flee their homes by the war.",
    "According to the United Nations, 477 out of 564 schools in Gaza have been directly hit or damaged in the war as of July 6. In June, an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed at least 33 people, including 12 women and children, according to local health officials.",
    "The strike came as American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators renewed their push for the two parties to achieve a cease-fire agreement that could help calm soaring tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.",
    "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others, according to the enclave\u2019s Health Ministry. The war was triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others.",
    "More than 1.9 million of Gaza\u2019s pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area of about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast."
