    "Colombo, Feb 21 (Daily Mirror) - Justifying the recent remark he had made in Mumbai that Sri Lanka is a part of India, Minister of Tourism and Lands Harin Fernando told Parliament today that Sri Lanka is indebted to the South Asian giant.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is indebted to India. India has come forward to help Sri Lanka during the recent difficult times. We have to be grateful to India for sending more and more tourists to Sri Lanka. India has also begun setting up its first overseas hotel in front of Galle face Hotel Colombo. Those who criticize me want to prevent investments such as this,\u201d the Minister said whilst highlighting that India has been a brother to Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIndia and Sri Lanka are traditionally connected. Take the story of Rama and Seetha, Arahath Mahinda came from India and so did Vijaya, Sri Lankan music and film industry are also connected to India,\u201d he said justifying his earlier comment.",
    "\u201cLet anyone accuse me of violating the Constitution and take me to court. I am willing to defend myself before the judiciary,\u201d he also said.",
    "At the same time the Minister alleged that the 15 minute speech he had made at a road show in Mumbai was edited and distorted.",
    "\u201cEditing and distorting a statement is common in the social and electronic media. This is the reason why Sri Lanka needs the Online Safety Bill today,\u201d he stressed."
