  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Australian Department of Home Affairs has recently updated evidence levels for student visa applications, as noted via the PRISMS system.",
    "While these levels are not officially published, the department uses them to assess the documentation required for student visa applications under the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF).",
    "Based on information circulated within official education and immigration networks, countries are currently categorized as follows:",
    "Evidence levels are part of Australia\u2019s risk-management approach to international education, reflecting past student visa compliance and other immigration outcomes.",
    "Both education providers and countries of citizenship are assigned evidence levels (Level 1, 2, or 3). The combination of these two factors determines how much documentation a student must provide.",
    "All institutions registered under the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) are assigned an evidence level:",
    "Level 2: Moderate-risk institutions \u2013 additional evidence may be requested depending on the student\u2019s country.",
    "Level 3: High-risk institutions \u2013 strictest requirements and higher scrutiny.",
    "Smaller institutions or those with limited visa outcome data are often assigned default levels, typically Level 2 or Level 3.",
    "Each country is also assigned a risk level, determined by historical data on student visa outcomes. Key factors include:",
    "* Visa refusals due to fraudulent documentation (weighted heavily in risk calculations)",
    "When assessing a student visa application, Home Affairs considers both the country and provider evidence levels:",
    "* Additional documents may be required, such as proof of English proficiency or financial capacity.",
    "* High-risk country + High-risk provider (Level 3 + Level 3):",
    "* Strictest requirements, higher scrutiny, and greater possibility of delays or refusals.",
    "Students from higher-risk countries may face stricter documentation requirements even when attending well-known institutions. This ensures the integrity of Australia\u2019s international education system while maintaining access for genuine students.",
    "In contrast, applicants from lower-risk countries may experience a smoother and faster process. The system is designed to manage risk effectively, targeting areas with higher instances of visa breaches or overstaying, without restricting genuine students."
