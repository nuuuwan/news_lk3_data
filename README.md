### Plantation workers are poor, destitute, and helpless, but their poetic expressions are marvellous

*2024-09-30 05:46:06* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Plantation-workers-are-poor-destitute-and-helpless-but-their-poetic-expressions-are-marvellous/4-767334) ¬∑ `en`

When the Britishers introduced tea as an export crop to old Ceylon in mid 19th century, it was a game changer. It transformed the traditional subsistence agricultural economy that prevailed to a modern plantation economy seeking to satisfy the demand for the new beverage called tea spreading like a pandemic across Europe and Americas. Initially, it was a beverage of the rich and the aristocrats. A pound of tea was sold, according to advertisements that were inserted in papers, for 25 Sterling Pounds. This exclusive product was made inclusive by ingenious marketing strategies adopted by tea traders like presenting it as a brain tonic.

### Social reformer AKD, Sri Lanka‚Äôs 9th President

*2024-09-30 05:35:49* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Social-reformer-AKD-Sri-Lanka-s-9th-President/4-767333) ¬∑ `en`

The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil shocked the country‚Äôs political establishment and sharply divided opinion. While some warned that Bolsonaro‚Äîa far-right populist who admired Brazil‚Äôs military dictatorship‚Äîposed a serious threat to democracy, others believed that Brazil‚Äôs strong institutions, including an assertive press and independent judiciary, would curb his authoritarian tendencies. This debate mirrors the global discussion surrounding populist leaders. Similarly, Sri Lanka is undergoing a political shift, with citizens demanding accountability from elites who have long failed them.

President Anura‚Äôs meteoric rise as a ‚ÄúLeader of the People‚Äù to become Sri Lanka‚Äôs 9th Executive President is emblematic of this trend. However, his presidency faces significant challenges, particularly in balancing his populist appeal with the deep-seated demands of economic governance and institutional reform.

To date, I have written over 25 letters to Principal Waththuhewa and over 10 to Education Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara, making the same appeal. I don‚Äôt mind their not acknowledging my emails, as long as they had acted to eradicate rampant money collections at the Royal Primary.

The Principal and his management team of 50 senior administrators completely ignore the thriving and omnipresent corruption happening right in front of them, employing a handpicked set of parents to rake in millions (without receipts/accounts/audits) and keeping the loot in private bank accounts. Please refer to the recent article where we showed the last year‚Äôs illegal collections topped Rs. 100 million (https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Education-Ministry-urged-to-probe-alleged-financial-malpractices-at-The-Royal-College-Primary/14-760265).

In his letter, the former MP pointed out that the Jaffna-Palaly road, particularly the east side next to the Vayavilan Central College, should be freed from military restrictions. This road connects to the Ponnalai road, an essential route for local traffic. He also emphasised the closure of the Achuveli Vayavilan-Tholakatti street, which has hampered the functioning of major Government and private enterprises in the region.

Nepal has shut schools for three days after landslides and floods triggered by two days of heavy rain across the Himalayan nation killed 151 people, with 56 missing, officials said on Sunday.

The floods brought traffic and normal activity to a standstill in the Kathmandu valley, where 37 deaths were recorded in a region home to 4 million people and the capital.

Authorities said students and their parents faced difficulties as university and school buildings damaged by the rains needed repair.

‚ÄúWe have urged the concerned authorities to close schools in the affected areas for three days,‚Äù Lakshmi Bhattarai, a spokesperson for the education ministry, told Reuters.

Some parts of the capital reported rain of up to 322.2 mm (12.7 inches), pushing the level of its main Bagmati river up 2.2 m (7 ft) past the danger mark, experts said.

üü©

Tamil National Party leader N.. Sirikantha said.

Sumanthiran has called for those who have left the Tamil National Alliance at various times. We are obliged to respond to him.

The Democratic Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is ready to work together with the TNA on the basis of the need to retain the representation of the Tamil people in Ampara and Trincomalee districts.

But in the election districts of Jaffna, Vanni and Batticaloa, there are many references to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the past.

Why is it invited to join?Do you compromise Tamil nationalism with the Sinhala nation?Or to retain the existing positions?Or to make indirect compromise with the rulers as in the past?We are forced to raise questions.

The decision of the Tamil National Party is that if unity is to be with policy and goal, we can never create that unity with the Sumanthiran -led team that dominates the TNA.

It is a deception that the entire Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãare united in the Tamil party.
