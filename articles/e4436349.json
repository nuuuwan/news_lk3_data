    "The Opposition has got an opportunity to go on the offensive on the propaganda front. It is all out to inflict maximum possible damage on the government as part of its strategy to recover lost ground. The JVP/NPP is defending itself like a kickboxer under a barrage of blows in a ruthless contest guided by no rules.",
    "The propaganda battle between the NPP and its rivals has got down and dirty. The Opposition politicians are making the most of their JVP/NPP counterparts\u2019 asset declarations submitted to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). The JVP has defended its members\u2019 right to acquire assets despite being the full-time cadres. The Opposition has fired another salvo; it claims the government politicians have not paid income tax for their assets declared to the CIABOC.",
    "Addressing the media yesterday, former Minister Udaya Gammanpila warned the government that its leaders would be prosecuted one day for tax evasion. The Opposition has reportedly sought information from the Inland Revenue Department about income tax paid by the government politicians, and made a large number of complaints to the CIABOC. If the JVP/NPP politicians have nothing to hide, they should be able to prove that they have paid taxes for their assets, provide documentary proof and put the matter to rest. However, whether they will be able to mitigate the political fallout of the Opposition\u2019s propaganda onslaught remains to be seen, for they have claimed that their party looks after them. There is also an ethical dimension to the issue at hand. Is it ethical for the JVP members with substantial assets to depend on their party for financial support?",
    "The Opposition, which has taken on the government with might and main, would do well to bear in mind that it is wielding a double-edged sword. It is not only the government politicians who should be called to account for financial disclosures. Their Opposition counterparts are also politicians of substance, as it were. Some of them are members of the political families accused of having amassed ill-gotten wealth. They haven\u2019t had any known sources of income. How come they have acquired so much wealth? Have they paid income tax for their assets? They cannot absolve themselves of their sins by bashing the government politicians.",
    "When the previous government decided to pay compensation to the then ruling party members whose properties suffered damage in arson attacks during Aragalaya (2022), we argued that first of all it had to be ascertained whether those assets had been acquired legally and declared to the tax department. However, the SLPP politicians were not asked to account for the damaged assets at issue, and the compensation they received allegedly exceeded their actual losses. A special probe should be conducted into this issue as state funds were utilised to pay compensation. Similarly, the perpetrators of arson attacks in question must be traced and prosecuted for their crimes. The incumbent government will not do so as it does not want to open a can of worms.",
    "Among the assets declared by the politicians of both the government and the Opposition are large amounts of gold. Time was when this country was not short of statespersons who were worth their weight in gold, so to speak. It looks as if the present-day politicians had gold hauls weighing as much as their own plump bodies. One hopes that the irony of politicians having gold assets has not been lost on the public known for their blind loyalty to political parties. Politicians have acquired gold while ordinary people are selling or pawning their gold jewellery, unable to make ends meet. Loan sharks are preying on farmers, who lose their land and equipment put up as collateral for loans.",
    "The politicians who promised to share in the economic hardships of the public are living the high life. Will electors ever learn?",
