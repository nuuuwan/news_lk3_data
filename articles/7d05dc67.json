    "Unavailability of verifiable documented cost records: Inconsistent record-keeping practices hinder comprehensive cost analysis.",
    "Non-preparation of cost statements in a standard manner: Difficulty in comparing data and drawing meaningful conclusions due to varied presentation formats.",
    "In response, CMASL agreed to collaborate with ICAI to address these shortcomings. Their joint initiative aims to:",
    "Promote the adoption of these standards across both public and private sectors in Sri Lanka.",
    "Introduce and promote standard cost reporting sheets, statements and guidelines, ensuring transparency and accuracy in financial reporting and having information to make informed decisions in price control.",

    "This collaborative effort promises to revolutionise cost accounting practices in Sri Lanka. By ensuring the availability of reliable and standardised cost information, the initiative empowers the Government and the public with the tools to make informed decisions and drive efficient resource management. Ultimately, the joint conference and subsequent collaboration mark a significant step towards fostering sustainable economic growth, affordable pricing and bolstering business performance and exports across the region."
