    "The notice was issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali Jayatunga after considering a request made by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), said Ada Derana reporter.",
    "Mahendran, who is currently residing in Singapore, was summoned to appear before court.",
    "It was revealed that although a notice had been issued last year, it had not been properly executed.",
