    "Sri Lanka\u2019s political discourse is ablaze following the arrest of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, accused of misappropriating approximately Rs. 16.9 million in public funds for a September 2023 London trip\u2014allegedly to attend his wife\u2019s university convocation, with no official meetings on his itinerary.",
    "At first glance, the charge sounds simple enough: taxpayers\u2019 money, a family trip, misuse. But politics, like life, is rarely that neat. This allegation raises deeper questions every citizen ought to reflect on: Is every movement of a Head of State automatically \u201cofficial\u201d? Or should leaders be judged by the same yardstick as private citizens, expected to pay out of pocket even when their position demands state resources? And at what point does the blending of personal and public duties become a matter of accountability?",
    "A President, unlike you or me, cannot simply book an online ticket and slip through the airport unnoticed. Every journey is accompanied by a security convoy, diplomatic clearance, protocol officers, and logistical support. These arrangements are not luxuries\u2014they are obligations of the State.",
    "Whether the President is addressing the UN, meeting another head of state, or attending a family event, the government machinery moves with him. This is the nature of the office.",
    "But here lies the tricky part: what if the trip contains a personal element? Should the public purse still bear the full expense?",
    "Sri Lanka is no stranger to blurred lines between personal and official travel.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s case is now in the spotlight because it involved his wife\u2019s convocation in London.",
    "The current President recently came under scrutiny for deploying state security and official vehicles for visits to Thambuththegama, Anuradhapura, where his ailing mother was receiving treatment. Sympathetic though the situation was, questions were raised: should public resources be tied up for personal family visits?",
    "During the recent election campaign, the President and several Cabinet ministers toured the country under the banner of the NPP and other parties. Official vehicles, security details, and government resources inevitably followed. Were these \u201cofficial\u201d or \u201cpolitical\u201d trips?",
    "These examples illustrate the same conundrum: private purposes wrapped in the unavoidable trappings of public office.",
    "According to parliamentary disclosures, between 2010\u20132024, over Rs. 3,956 million was spent on overseas travel by Presidents and their entourages.",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa alone accounted for Rs. 3,572 million between 2010\u20132014, with his most expensive single year being 2013, when his trips cost the state Rs. 1,144 million.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake (since Sept. 2024) has spent just Rs. 1.8 million on foreign travel. This claim has been contested by the Opposition, which insists that it should be much higher.",
    "Placed in this context, the Rs. 16.9 million in question during Wickremesinghe\u2019s London trip may look modest compared to Mahinda\u2019s billion-rupee years\u2014but it strikes a nerve because it appears tied to a purely personal occasion, not diplomacy or governance.",
    "Legal experts have long wrestled with this blurred boundary. Ali Sabry, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, has argued that it is nearly impossible to draw a perfect line between official and private conduct in the life of a political leader. A President or Minister remains a public figure 24 hours a day. Even their private movements require state protection and resources.",
    "As many lawyers and scholars highlight, what matters is not whether private and public overlap, but whether the overlap is done in good faith or in abuse of power.",
    "Did the leader intentionally divert public money for personal enrichment? Or did state expenditure arise naturally because of the responsibilities of office? This distinction is crucial.",
    "The phrase \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d carries two powerful origins \u2014 one modern, one ancient.",
    "In aviation, it refers to the exact point in a long flight when an aircraft no longer has enough fuel to turn back. Beyond that, the pilot must press on, no matter what the risks ahead. During World War II, bomber crews often faced this calculation: once beyond the point of no return, there was no choice but to fly into enemy territory, even if weather worsened or defences thickened.",
    "But in ancient history, the phrase finds its political metaphor. In 49 BC, Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River with his army, an act forbidden by Roman law. By doing so, he made civil war inevitable. The die was cast, retreat impossible. That moment became the classic symbol of a political point of no return \u2014 a decision so consequential that there is no path back.",
    "When drawing on this dual imagery: the pilot who cannot turn back, and Caesar who, once across the Rubicon, changed history irreversibly. The argument is that, there is a danger that Sri Lanka\u2019s institutions may cross a point where constant abuse of privilege and weak ethical standards make it impossible to rebuild public confidence.",
    "Relating this to today\u2019s controversies, including the Ranil Wickremesinghe London trip:",
    "If every act that blends private and public is condemned as \u201cmisuse,\u201d then the public ceases to differentiate between abuse of office and incidental costs of high office.",
    "Once citizens treat all acts as corrupt, Sri Lanka itself crosses a Rubicon \u2014 a point of no return where cynicism permanently replaces trust.",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa faced criticism for the size of his delegations abroad and use of state funds for family members\u2019 travel.",
    "Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was questioned overuse of the Presidential aircraft for both official and semi-official trips.",
    "Even J.R. Jayewardene in the 1980s was accused of blurring official travel with family commitments.",
    "None of these cases were ever clearly resolved, partly because Sri Lanka lacks strict guidelines on how to classify official versus private expenses. The vacuum leaves the door open to selective outrage, often driven more by politics than by principle.",
    "For ordinary citizens, struggling with high inflation and daily survival, such debates often sound like elites protecting each other. \u201cWhy should my tax money pay for a politician\u2019s family trip?\u201d is a fair and emotional question.",
    "But the counterpoint is equally important: If we expect our leaders to serve, travel, and represent the country, we must accept that public funds will sometimes cover situations that look private. The problem is not overlap\u2014it is excess.",
    "A President accompanying his wife abroad, while carrying state duties, may be acceptable.",
    "A President using public aircraft to fly in supporters for political rallies is not.",
    "A Minister who attends a personal event but also holds bilateral meetings could argue that his role justifies the expense. A Minister who disguises a holiday as \u201cofficial business\u201d crosses the line.",
    "This is where the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d metaphor bites: once politicians repeatedly blur private and public without accountability, trust in government collapses. Citizens then view all spending as theft, regardless of context.",
    "And then came the parade of visitors\u2014Wickremesinghe\u2019s old political enemies, suddenly transformed into bedside sympathisers. Men and women who once thundered about his failures now with practiced solemnity, as if paying homage to a fallen monarch. Some scholars saw it not as compassion but as a class solidarity, elite and non-elite. In Sri Lanka, the political elite may clash fiercely in public, like cats, but when scrutiny arrives, old enemies close ranks. Leaders once condemned as tyrants are swiftly rebranded as \u201crespected statesmen,\u201d while citizens are expected to applaud. It is hardly surprising, then, that public faith in politics continues to erode.",
    "The Ranil Wickremesinghe controversy is less about one former President\u2019s trip and more about Sri Lanka\u2019s culture of accountability. We are at risk of reaching a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d in public trust, where citizens no longer distinguish between minor overlaps and major abuses.",
    "So, the next time you hear cries of \u201cmisuse,\u201d don\u2019t just ask who paid the bill. Ask instead:",
    "Was it in good faith linked naturally to the duties of office?",
    "Did it cross the line from overlap to outright exploitation?",
    "That, more than headlines or political mudslinging, may be the true test of integrity in public life.",
