அதாவது சம்பள நிர்ணய சபையின்  தீர்மானங்களை கம்பனிகள் நடைமுறைப்படுத்தாவிட்டால் அத்தொகையை செலுத்த வேண்டும் என நான் ஒரு சட்டத்தை கொண்டு வருவேன். அதன்பிறகு  கம்பனிகளால் நீதிமன்றத்தை நாட முடியாது.

Across Sri Lanka from north to south, an astonishing 90% of the population relies on public transport for their daily commutes.

The reality is stark; private bus services are marked by a host of problems that contribute to a deteriorating passenger experience.

The challenges are multifaceted and impact every aspect of bus travel. Boarding and alighting from buses can be a stressful experience with passengers often battling overcrowded conditions and poorly designed bus entry and exit points. Once on board, the issues continue.

“Nature builds no machines,” wrote Marx in a famous passage in the Grundrisse. They are “products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature.” Fundamentally, Marxism is the (socialist) theory and practice of industrial societies. Marx’s insights on the logic of automation is now drawing the attention of technology watchers who are both excited and concerned by the current phenomenon of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the complex environment of human labour, labour-created, labour-saving and labour-replacing machinery and automation, and the mostly uneven industrial society at large, engineering education and research are a critical medium providing training to human resources and technical mastery over material resources.

### The final minutes of Sheikh Hasina as a hateful authority ..........

*2024-08-10 21:52:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190755) · `ta`

In the face of escalating protests and violence, Sheikh Hasina, the Bangladeshi prime minister, faced a tumultuous end to her tenure. Despite calls for peace and attempts to negotiate with security forces and military officials, the situation spiraled out of control. Faced with overwhelming public opposition and internal conflicts within the government, Hasina eventually decided to flee her official residence. This decision came after a series of events including violent clashes, rising death tolls, and a failed attempt to secure her safety. Ultimately, the pressure from both the public and the military proved too great, leading to Hasina's departure from Bangladesh.

🟩

Sheikh Hasina called on the security forces to end the violence in Bangladesh on Sunday, and she was not in the process of accepting that his time was over as prime minister.

But in the next few hours he was beaten by the power of the people.

His son told the BBC that his family's consultation had left him out of Bangladesh rather than the security forces in the end.

Hasina made the decision to leave at the right moment-he fled and entered his official residence in a few hours.

Sheikh Sina was invited to a meeting of the National Security Council on Sunday morning.

The meeting took place in a situation where protests against the prime minister have been on the rise as protests have taken place over the country for several weeks.

On Sunday alone, more than 90 people lost their lives. Many people were shot dead by security forces.

From the time Ranil  Wickremesinghe returned to the seat of  power as Prime Minister  and later as President,   false narratives have been  concocted and circulated e by his opponents, adeversaries, critics and detractors about him.  One was that Wickremesinghe was afraid to face a presidential election and that he would put off  the poll through unorthodox measures.

This falsehood was exposed when the date of the presidential poll was gazetted by the Election Commission. Wickremesinghe was the first to pay his election deposit as an independent candidate. Unable to confront this reality,Ranil’s foes now comfort themselves saying “wait and see will you,he will do something before the election”.

### The Tiger Moth Story

*2024-08-10 19:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-tiger-moth-story/) · `en`

In my fifty-plus years of association with aviation, the best aeroplane I ever flew was undoubtedly the De Haviland Tiger Moth. As a young student pilot, I used to regularly fly the ‘Tiger’, operating off the old grass strip which was the runway we used to take-off and land. The reason for using the grass for the operation was simply a matter of safety. The ‘Tiger’ had two wheels like in a handcart and instead of a rear wheel to complete a triangular undercarriage, it had only a tail-skid with tough leather covering. The ‘Tiger’ had no brakes, the dragging tail-skid was what stopped it after landing. As for the take-off, we opened the Gypsy Major engine and it powered a long beautiful wooden propeller and with the gathering of speed, the tail lifted, and the Tiger Moth rolled majestically to reach its lift-off speed of 55 knots.

### Kamala Harris picks Minnesota Governor, Tim Walz, as running mate

*2024-08-10 13:40:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/kamala-harris-picks-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-as-running-mate/) · `en`

Marquette University Likely Voters’ Poll, August 8 – KAMALA 53%; TRUMP 47%

When Kamala Harris was asked just after she became the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee for the presidency about two weeks ago, whom she would pick as her running mate, she responded with twinkling eyes, flashing that charming smile, “Muhammad Ali!”

Obviously in jest. While Ali may have possessed the unique characteristics in his boxing style of butterflies and bees that Kamala seeks in her political style: of movement of grace, facing challenges head-on and making devastating impact when it counts, Ali lacked the essential qualification for the running mate of a Black/South Asian/Baptist/Hindu woman, married to a Jew: a WASP – a White, Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Besides, he was dead.

The choice she made last Tuesday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, met this vital qualification, in spades. He is white, with a German/Swedish heritage and a Lutheran, the largest sect of Protestant denominations.

### ‘A priest like no other’

*2024-08-10 12:46:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-priest-like-no-other/) · `en`

It was about 40 years ago that I first visited the Gangaramaya Temple and met ‘Podi Hamuduruwo’. By then my wife, Shanti, had donated to the Temple a large Swarovski Lotus to be used to display the relics. The priest said that this was the first time that the temple – despite its long existence- received a valuable crystal item but soon thereafter the temple began to receive gifts of a similar magnitude which he described as an ‘auspices phenomenon’.

Over the years we became close friends and exchanged many ideas about the country and religion. Almost on every such occasion he shared his thoughts on what he could do for the country and I said that I would be happy to assist in such ventures to the extent possible. We constructed four rooms at the Kataragama Pilgrims rest and contributed monthly funds to feed the pilgrims who stayed there free of charge. We also had the rare and good fortune to undertake the annual Katina pinkama.
