I had put them in a new place to read later, but had then forgotten about them. It was salutary that they were rediscovered, and I have since spent many happy hours with them.

One that I found fascinating was a booklet in a series produced in the seventies by the Cultural Affairs Department. This was about Theatre in Sri Lanka, and was by A J Gunawardena, who had become a good friend in the decade after I started working for the British Council. He was a polymath and, though an academic in the field of English at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, he was an authority on the Arts, and indeed was seconded from there to head the Institute of Aesthetic Studies.

### Tribute to Rajiv Perera on his 60th birthday

*2025-09-20 16:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tribute-to-rajiv-perera-on-his-60th-birthday/) · `en`

In life we meet many people, most of whom hardly leave a trace of their passing. Some, very few in fact, leave a mark so deep that no passage of time can erase it. For me, at the very top of that list is Rajiv Perera.

I knew of Rajiv at school – St Thomas’, Mount Lavinia – where he was a few years senior to me. A fine sportsman, he played rugby for S. Thomas’, CH & FC, and Sri Lanka. On the field he was fearless yet always a gentleman, respected by teammates and opponents alike. That same spirit carried into the rest of his life competitive when it mattered, but always fair, always gracious.

But I only really got to know him when I went to the UK for my higher studies, about 35 years ago. This was around the time that John Major had replaced the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, and was just settling in as Prime Minister. I knew only a few people in London. It was through the Thomian network that I met Rajiv. We clicked immediately.

### My golden years at Kingswood College

*2025-09-20 16:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-golden-years-at-kingswood-college/) · `en`

Mr. Louis Edmund Blaze’ started his school, which he named Boys’ High School at No. 11, Pavilion Street in the Kandy town itself (the premises were secured by Mr. JW Samaraweera) with 11 boys – quite a coincidence between the school roll and its address – on May 4, 1891 with the intention that it should be run as far as possible on the lines of the old British Public Schools. Later, when the number of students grew, the school was shifted to Brownrigg Street (now Yatinuwara Veediya).

As the rooms in Pavilion Street became too small with increasing number of students, the school was shifted to a house in Brownrigg Street, which had been built by Mr. William Staples about 50 years before. The school began academic activities on January 12, 1898. In December 1897 the school moved into larger premises in Browrigg Street, where the school hall was built and the Boys’ High School took the name of Kingswood College.
