### No rice imports permitted in Sri Lanka, says State FinMin

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka government has not allowed any rice imports and the permission to buy the staple food outside the country for the public consumption has not been granted to anybody, State Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The island nation, which is self sufficient in rice production, imports the staple food from time to time when there is scarcity or the traders stubbornly maintain high prices at retail level.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government reduced import tax on rice by 65 rupee per kilo to 1 rupee in January this year to import some rice and control high domestic prices.

The move came after millers and collectors drove up the price due to lack of free trade.

However, State Finance Minister Siyambalapitiya said no permission has been given for the import of rice and only the required quantity of Basmati rice has been given for the needs of tourist hotels.

### The Impact Of The Next Election On The Economic Reforms

The next election is going to be a presidential election and according to the constitution it will be held during September-October 2024. Last year we observed the postponement of the elections of local bodies and the explanation given was that there were not sufficient funds to allocate for the elections due to the economic crisis. As a country, solving the economic crisis should be the priority and not who solved it. The upcoming presidential election cannot be postponed while keeping the democratic status of the country.

The government agreed with the IMF the conditions of the revival plan and in return Sri Lanka is getting IMF assistance in the form of  48-month Extended Fund Facility  of SDR 2.286 billion (around USD 3 billion) to be released in half yearly instalments. Next major step is external debt restructuring which is already delayed. With this delay the IMF delayed their second tranche and paid it last December amounting to USD 337 million.

(Reuters) - Debt-for-nature swaps, where poorer countries have debt written off in return for protecting ecosystems such as barrier reefs or rainforests, could provide $100 billion for the fight against climate change, a new report has calculated.

The UK-based, non-profit International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) based the estimate on the possibility of debt swaps in many of the 49 less developed countries seen as most at risk of debt crises.

Belize, Ecuador, Barbados, Gabon and Cabo Verde have all done such swaps in recent years and Laura Kelly, the director of IIED’s sustainable markets research group, said many of those in debt distress and also often most threatened by global warming, were looking at them.

The IMF and World Bank, whose figures the analysis is based on, estimate the countries focused on collectively owe $431 billion, mostly to wealthier governments, the IMF itself and pension and hedge funds.
