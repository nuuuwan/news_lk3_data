    "Sri Lanka\u2019s trade dynamics highlight both the promise of industrial expansion and the challenge of import dependency",
    "After experiencing its most severe economic contraction in decades, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is gradually turning a corner. Between 2022 and 2023, the country underwent a painful but necessary period of adjustment following a debt-fuelled crisis. The latest projections for 2024\u20132027 suggest a modest but sustained recovery, with signs of improving investor confidence, rising consumption, and renewed capital formation.",
    "In 2022, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy contracted by 7.3%, marking the peak of its financial crisis\u2014triggered by unsustainable external debt, a collapse in foreign reserves, and severe governance failures. The impact was widespread, affecting households, businesses, and Government operations alike. Although the contraction moderated to -2.3% in 2023, the economy remained in a fragile state, with private consumption and investment still subdued.",

    "Sri Lanka\u2019s total imports have followed a steep upward trajectory over the past decade. From Rs. 2.54 trillion in 2014, imports more than doubled to Rs. 5.74 trillion by 2022. Although 2023 saw a slight decline, provisional figures for 2024 indicate a rebound to Rs. 5.69 trillion.",
