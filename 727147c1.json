  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka has made commendable strides towards fiscal discipline, particularly in the area of controlling government spending and managing inflation, Rockefeller International chairman and founder and CIO, Breakout Capital Ruchir Sharma said.",
    "Sharma was speaking at a special public lecture in Colombo recently, organized by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. At the outset he said that Sri Lanka is a country to which he could connect emotionally. `I love coming here whenever I can. If I have to come for a vacation it has to be Sri Lanka, he said.",
    "Sharma added: \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s mounting government debt and its low Tax-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio is causing concern. These are significant fiscal challenges that the country must address.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s effective monetary policy has helped tame inflation. However, there should be sustained vigilance to prevent inflationary pressures from resurfacing.",
    "\u2018In my book, \u201cThe 10 Rules of Successful Nations\u201d, I have defined 10 rules and areas of growth. They are; Population, Politics, State, Debt, Currency, Investment, Inflation, Geography, Inequality and Sentiment.",
    "\u2018There are some 200 countries and of these countries only 40 countries or so are classified as developed countries. All the other countries are classified as emerging markets and most of them have been emerging forever.",
    "\u2018The only country to move up from developing to developed country status was South Korea in the 1980s and since then no other country has followed suit.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka too has been ranked as a developing country for many years but has not moved up. This is despite Sri Lanka having notched many a positive landmark, such as in education and health.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka has to do much to improve overall development and accelerate the engine of growth.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s working age population growth, for example, remains 0.1%, which is an obstacle to economic growth.",
    "\u2018Furthermore, Sri Lanka scores low in the area of State because the tax contribution to the state remains minimal. Due to the current politically volatile state of the country, Sri Lanka also ranks low in terms of Politics, where results of an election would determine its development.",
    "\u2018Currency being cheap is good if it is stable, but the key is avoiding unreliable measures. Sri Lanka ranks well in the area of Currency because it is cheap.",
    "\u2018In terms of Geography, despite the many opportunities and potential, Sri Lanka has not been able to fully exploit and capitalize on its geography. Intraregional trade is vital for the development of countries, yet South Asia has low intraregional trade and therefore misses many opportunities for growth.",
    "\u2018The problem of internal geography is of such proportions that much of the wealth is concentrated in the Colombo area and there is not enough in the other areas.",
    "\u201cGenerally, I would say, Sri Lanka ranks relatively well at this point from an investment perspective and issues of liquidity, among other things. But this is a big improvement over the last couple of years. Once the political situation becomes stable, the key for Sri Lanka is, what is going to be your growth engine?",
    "\u2018The classic growth engine is manufacturing exports. For countries with Sri Lanka\u2019s per capita income, the latter is necessary to grow rapidly. But with that growth engine looking difficult to bring about, what could be the growth engine for Sri Lanka to grow even at 5%, because 6-7% seems very difficult given the demographics of the country.",
    "\u2018The country should determine a suitable growth engine for it as even raising the economic growth rate by 5% is crucial. Sri Lanka should catch up considering the time lost during its economic crisis.\u2019",
    "Meanwhile, on the question of introducing a wealth tax, Sharma said, among other things, that it is very difficult to correct inequalities by initiating such a tax.",
    "Hotels going in for right issues in preparation for tourist season",
    "Ruchir Sharma urges Sri Lanka to spring a \u2018surprise on the upside\u2019 to catch foreign investors\u2019 eye",
