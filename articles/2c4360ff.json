  "original_title": "KKS Port: A Missed Opportunity Or A Strategic Gateway For Sri Lanka\u2013India Relations?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Recent remarks by Minister Bimal Rathnayake, suggesting that the development of the Kankesanthurai (KKS) Port should be deprioritised, overlook both the economic and strategic realities facing Sri Lanka today. Available data, feasibility assessments, and the operational success of the Nagapattinam\u2013KKS passenger ferry all point to one conclusion \u2014 the KKS Port is not only viable but essential for building a sustainable bilateral partnership between India and Sri Lanka.",
    "The Northern Province, and particularly Jaffna, remains one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most underutilised economic regions. A functional port at KKS can directly link northern producers \u2014 fisheries, agriculture, dairy, and Palmyra-based industries \u2014 to regional markets across the Palk Strait.",
    "Early feasibility studies, supported by the Government of India\u2019s US$61 million grant, show clear commercial potential. Even at conservative estimates, monthly cargo volumes could reach 2,000\u20135,000 tonnes, while passenger traffic through the existing high-speed ferry already ranges from 1,200 to 2,000 travellers per month, with the capacity to rise beyond 5,000 once daily operations resume.",
    "These are not speculative figures \u2014 they are based on ongoing operations and logistical data collected by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and supporting agencies. The demand already exists; what is missing is the political will to expand it.",
    "Strategically, KKS offers an opportunity for Sri Lanka to strengthen bilateral trade, tourism, and cultural exchange with southern India. The port\u2019s geographical proximity to Tamil Nadu reduces transportation time and cost compared with routing through Colombo. Businesses have estimated potential logistics savings of 20\u201340%, particularly for perishable goods such as fish, vegetables, and dairy products.",
    "Moreover, a functioning northern port would ease congestion at Colombo, diversify national port infrastructure, and provide regional resilience against future disruptions \u2014 something both countries learned during the COVID-19 and fuel crisis periods.",
    "Concerns about environmental impact and local displacement are valid, but these are already addressed through the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and associated mitigation measures. Rejecting the project outright based on broad environmental arguments is not a progressive approach. Instead, the focus should be on transparent implementation, community oversight, and ensuring local employment and fisher compensation within the development plan.",
    "KKS is more than a port \u2014 it is a potential symbol of reconciliation and partnership between Sri Lanka and India. For decades, northern communities have been excluded from major development initiatives. Reviving KKS means decentralising economic growth, integrating the Northern Province into the national economy, and opening direct people-to-people routes that strengthen trust and regional cooperation.",
    "Abandoning or delaying the project sends the wrong signal \u2014 that Sri Lanka is willing to let political hesitation override economic pragmatism and regional opportunity.",
    "1. Complete and publish the full feasibility and business plan, detailing demand forecasts and investment returns.",
    "2. Phase operations \u2014 continue passenger and light cargo first, then expand to full commercial scale with dredging and warehousing upgrades.",
    "3. Guarantee environmental safeguards and include local representation in monitoring committees.",
    "4. Facilitate bilateral coordination between Indian and Sri Lankan port authorities for efficient customs, ferry schedules, and trade protocols.",
    "Bimal Rathnayake\u2019s concern that KKS development is unnecessary or politically sensitive may reflect caution, but it contradicts the data and regional logic. The KKS Port is not an indulgence \u2014 it is a strategic necessity for the island\u2019s northern revival and a cornerstone of balanced India\u2013Sri Lanka relations.",
    "Ignoring this opportunity risks isolating the Northern Province yet again, while embracing it could transform Jaffna into the northern gateway of a new economic corridor \u2014 one built on trade, trust, and true regional cooperation."
