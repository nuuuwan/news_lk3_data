    "It will be five years on the 12th of September 2024 since my good friend Kumar Fernando left this world quite suddenly and be with his creator. Although five years seems a long time, his memory and caring\u00a0ways are something that will always live in the life of those who knew this wonderful human being. I have missed him since that day five years ago and it all came flooding back to me when i went to Melbourne for a few days last month and met with his family over a lovely dinner at his daughter Tehani\u2019s home.",
    "Tehani and family had taken great pains to prepare a scrumptious dinner for us and whilst we all appreciated the care and trouble taken, an emptiness kept tugging at me,\u00a0that something was missing and that was Kumar\u2019s\u00a0presence and enduring ways as he was always a warm and caring person.\u00a0Despite the joyful evening, there was sadness in me, since I was visiting their home for the first time since his passing away.",
    "I can never forget this genial personality whom I had known for 45 years until his death and had the honour of being his best-man at his wedding many years ago.",
    "Kumar always unhesitatingly helped others who were in need without thinking of his own priorities and this is something that I will never forget. Rare are human beings of this nature. I have personally known people whom he has helped, when they were in trouble and in difficulty and who may not have been well disposed towards him. Yet Kumar was the first person to lend a helping hand without expecting anything in return from such people.",
    "He was a very successful Planter in Sri Lanka serving on many well-known estates\u00a0before moving over to Transkei, South Africa, where he displayed his wonderful leadership capabilities in that country\u2019s tea plantations.",
    "He later moved over to Melbourne,\u00a0Australia and set-up a very successful food business which he and the family were operating until his untimely demise in 2019. Even in Melbourne he lent a hand to many of his friends and helped them in numerous ways and I am ever grateful to him for the advice and support he always extended to my brother-in-law and family for which I am eternally grateful.",
    "I can\u2019t help but quote Psalm 112 \u201cHow joyful are those who fear the Lord and delight in obeying his commands. Their children will be successful everywhere and an entire generation of Godly people will be blessed. They themselves will be wealthy and their good deeds will last forever.\u201d",
    "When I think of Kumar\u2019s family, his wife Nelunika, Daughter Tehani and Sons Ayesh and Sudesh, and his adorable grandchildren the words of the Psalmist\u00a0have truly been fulfilled. That is the legacy that Kumar left behind and the Lord has blessed him and his family. I was proud to be called his friend and I still truly miss him.",
