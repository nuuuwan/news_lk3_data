    "\u201cThere are four parties that are responsible for developing the country, namely politicians, Government officials, the private sector and the public. These four parties should humbly fulfil their respective duties. When the Sanasa movement was established, we went from village to village, procured the initial capital, and started banks. The common man should also be given an opportunity. They are capable of immensely contributing to the development of the country,\u201d said Dr. Kiriwandeniya.",
