    "The Executive Centre (TEC), Asia\u2019s largest premium workspace provider with a presence in 16 countries across Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Australia, is poised to further expand its footprint in Sri Lanka. As part of its strategic growth, TEC has invested USD 750K to open a new floor in the East Tower of the World Trade Center in Colombo. This follows TEC\u2019s maiden entry into Sri Lanka in 2017, when it first established two centres in the West Tower of the World Trade Center and one centre at MAGA One.",
    "Located in the iconic twin tower of Colombo, the newly designed workspace adheres to international design standards, promising enhanced experiences and improved productivity for its members. Currently, TEC\u2019s overall occupancy rate in Sri Lanka is at 96%, making it a preferred choice for businesses. Building on the success of its existing centres, the new additional space spread across approximately 9,000 sq.ft. with a total of 160 workstations, will provide state-of-the-art facilities including lounge, coworking area, meeting rooms, phone booths and a barista bar. This is yet another step towards the company\u2019s continuing expansion in South Asia, backed by a robust demand for flexible workspaces.",
