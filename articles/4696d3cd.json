    "In Sri Lanka, the intense focus on the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, in primary school, has led many parents and schools to prioritise test preparation over helping children develop their foundational skills. Although academic success is important, focusing too much on exam scores often comes at the expense of one of the most essential skills a child must acquire in the early years, the ability to read fluently with understanding.",
    "Reading is not just a subject taught in classrooms but it is the gateway to all future learning. A child who reads well can access knowledge in every subject, think critically, and learn independently. Without this skill, students may memorise facts to pass examinations, but they struggle to understand texts in Science, History, or Mathematics. They miss out on the joy of learning and the ability to grow as confident thinkers. As children move beyond primary school, the consequences of poor reading skills become more serious. Many continue to fall behind, not because they lack intelligence, but because they never received the right support to become strong readers. Over time, this results in lower literacy rates and a less skilled workforce, affecting both individuals and the national development.",
    "This article explains how reading skills are built, why they matter more than examination scores, and how parents can play a key role in supporting their child\u2019s reading journey.",
    "Reading is one of the most important skills your child can learn. It is the base for all other learning: Mathematics, Science, History, and even digital literacy. Children who read well do better in school, find good jobs and earn more money in the future. Reading also helps them make good decisions about their health and take part in society (World Bank 2021).",
    "If a child cannot read fluently, they may struggle to study, grow, or find opportunities. Reading is not just for passing examinations. It is essential for life. As a parent, you play a vital role. Read with your child, talk about books, and help them enjoy the experience. When children read more, they learn more and build a stronger future.",
    "Reading is not a skill we are born with. Unlike speaking, which develops naturally, reading must be taught. When a child learns to read, the brain must connect letters and spellings with the sounds of spoken language, eventually leading to word meaning. This process, often called \u201cre-tuning the brain,\u201d requires deliberate and repeated instruction (Scarborough, 2001). For this process, the brain must use areas that were first made for recognising faces and objects. Re-tuning takes time, practice, and good teaching. Whether your child reads in Sinhala, Tamil, or English, the learning process is the same: recognise spelling patterns, convert them to sounds, and understand their meaning. This takes time, practice, and strong support from parents and teachers. When reading becomes part of a child\u2019s daily routine, their brain becomes stronger for learning and life.",
    "Before children become good readers, they must first become confident speakers. Spoken language is the foundation of reading. A child who speaks and understands language well is more likely to understand what they read later (Scarborough, 2001). Simple activities like singing rhymes, playing word games, and asking and answering questions help build these skills. When children begin learning in their mother tongue, they develop stronger speaking and thinking abilities, which support future reading success.",
    "Once children learn to speak, the next step is understanding how letters link to sounds. This does not happen naturally. Children need step-by-step phonics instruction to learn that letters stand for sounds. Phonics helps them \u201cdecode\u201d words by sounding them out, allowing them to read any word they already know from speaking (Shanahan, 2022).",
    "Decoding takes time and regular practice. Children must learn basic rules as well as exceptions like \u201claugh\u201d or \u201cbuffet.\u201d They also need to know how letters can change roles in different words. This flexibility comes only with strong teaching of the regular patterns first. Experts recommend daily phonics for at least two years to help children become confident, independent readers.",
    "Two Skills, One Goal: How Children Learn to Read and Understand?",
    "Reading is not just about saying the words on a page. It is about understanding them. The Simple View of Reading, developed by Gough and Tunmer (1986) shows that reading comprehension depends on two essential skills:",
    "(1) Decoding \u2013 the ability to sound out and read words correctly",
    "(2) Language comprehension \u2013 the ability to understand spoken language and vocabulary",
    "If either skill is weak, the child will struggle to make sense of what they read. These two skills work together like a multiplication equation:",
    "If either one is weak, overall comprehension will be low, even if the other is strong.",
    "More recent research highlights that decoding should not only mean sounding out words but doing so fluently and automatically. This is called \u2018fluent word reading\u2019. When children can read words quickly without stopping to figure them out, they have more brain space left to focus on understanding the meaning of what they are reading.",
    "As literacy expert David Kilpatrick explains, \u201cIf a child can read the words and understand the same text when it\u2019s read to them, they should be able to understand it when reading on their own.\u201d That\u2019s why parents and teachers must check both skills: Can the child read the words? Do they understand the language being used? Supporting both areas is key to helping every child become a confident and thoughtful reader.",
    "While children naturally learn to speak and listen just by being around language, reading and writing are different. They are not skills we are born with. In fact, reading is a human invention. As psychologist Steven Pinker says, \u201cChildren are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on.\u201d This means our brains are not built for reading and that we have to train them.",
    "Learning to read requires years of practice, high-quality instruction, and structured teaching. Sadly, many children struggle not because they lack ability, but because they were not taught effectively (World Bank, 2021). With the right guidance, nearly every child can become a successful reader.",
    "Fluent reading does not happen overnight. It is built through regular practice, strong teaching, and reading meaningful text again and again. First, children must learn to recognise words quickly by linking sounds to spellings. Once they can do this automatically, they are ready to become fluent readers. But fluency is more than just saying the words. It also means reading in a smooth, natural way, in phrases and sentences that carry meaning.",
    "Fluent readers recognise words automatically, freeing their brain to think about meaning. Fluency is the bridge from \u201clearning to read\u201d to \u201creading to learn.\u201d Once that bridge is crossed, children are ready to explore ideas, gain knowledge, and enjoy reading as a lifelong skill.",
    "From Words to Meaning: Helping Children Understand What They Read",
    "Once word recognition becomes automatic, the next challenge is comprehension. Teachers help children build comprehension through four main goals. Reading is not just about saying words correctly, but about making sense of them. That is why teachers must always support reading comprehension in everything they do. According to Kilpatrick (2015), there are four main goals for helping children improve understanding:",
    "Teaching children to check if they understand what they read",
    "Teachers use many helpful techniques to do this. Shared reading is one way to introduce children to new words, ideas, and language patterns. Guided reading gives children a chance to read with support, e.g. teachers explain new words, ask questions to allow children to engage with texts actively and help children think about the story or topic. Children also learn comprehension strategies like checking their own understanding, re-reading, asking questions, and imagining what they read.",
    "These strategies not only improve comprehension, but also help children read longer and more confidently. The goal is for every child to become an independent reader, someone who can read on their own, understand the meaning, and enjoy it, too.",
    "For children to become skilled readers, they need high-quality instruction more than just books. Research shows that effective reading instruction depends on three important factors:",
    "A good reading programme is not just about covering lessons. it is about making sure students are being taught the right skills in the right way.",
    "Teachers must focus on key reading components, like phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension, using proven methods that help children learn step by step. A well-designed curriculum should be turned into daily classroom experiences that are rich, focused, and carefully planned. The more time children spend actively reading and practicing these skills with support, the more likely they are to become confident and independent readers. When teaching is clear, consistent, and engaging, students are more likely to succeed.",
