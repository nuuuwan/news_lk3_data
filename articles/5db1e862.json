    "Cabinet Spokesperson says Bill not aimed at ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa",
    "Parliament Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramarathne yesterday informed the House that the Supreme Court has determined the Bill titled Presidents\u2019 Entitlements (Repeal) is consistent with the Constitution and can be enacted by a simple majority.",
    "The Bill had been challenged before the Court under Article 121(1) of the Constitution. However, the Court ruled that none of its provisions are unconstitutional.",
    "Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the Bill was not aimed at any individual former President, including Mahinda Rajapaksa, but was drafted to apply to all former Presidents and their spouses.",
    "Responding to questions at the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday, he said the law would take effect once enacted and would then apply to the relevant former Presidents. He added that no date had been set for their removal from official residences and expressed confidence that those who had served as executive Presidents and long in the legislature would abide by the law once it was passed."
