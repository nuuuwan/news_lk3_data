    "Defence Minister and President Anura Kumara Disanayake has directed the Sri Lanka Navy to take charge of providing operational and administrative support for foreign private security companies engaged in protecting merchant vessels.",
    "In a letter to the Speaker of Parliament dated 20 September 2025, the President said the order was issued under Section 21 of the Navy Act (Chapter 358), citing national interest.",
    "The directive authorises the Navy to maintain a maritime security operation project, covering services and facilities for foreign private maritime security providers. The Navy will also be responsible for storing firearms, ammunition and other equipment belonging to such companies in its armouries, and for transporting the weapons and equipment as required.",
    "According to the order, these duties will be carried out under the supervision of the Defence Ministry, with vehicles or vessels provided by local representatives of the foreign firms, and will be classified as non-naval duties.",
    "The President informed Parliament of the decision in line with statutory requirements under the Navy Act.",
    "Since 2012 the Navy had facilitated the storage and transfer of weapons for private security providers through semi-State companies. These entities, such as the Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd., acted as intermediaries, generating revenue but also drawing controversy over accountability and transparency.",
    "While the Navy played an operational role, the framework rested on contractual arrangements rather than a direct statutory mandate.",
    "Under the new directive, the Navy\u2019s role is explicitly expanded to cover not only storage and transfer of weapons but also the operational, administrative and financial management of the entire project.",
    "By issuing the order under Section 21 of the Navy Act and informing Parliament, the Government has placed the program on a clear legal footing and ensured it is subject to Parliamentary record. The directive also makes foreign private maritime security companies responsible for providing the vehicles and vessels required for transport, with the Navy tasked with ensuring security and supervision.",
    "The Government\u2019s decision is expected to tighten oversight of the industry and reduce the legal ambiguities that have surrounded maritime security services in Sri Lanka, particularly in the aftermath of allegations of mismanagement and irregularities in earlier public\u2013private arrangements."
