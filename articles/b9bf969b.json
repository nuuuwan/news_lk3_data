    "Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday said its leader Sajith Premadasa is ready for the proposed debate with National People's Power (NPP), leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the policies of both parties on economic issues in the month of May but not on dates proposed by NPP Member Nalinda Jayatissa.",
    "Dr Jayatissa proposed that the NPP Leader is ready for the date on May 7, 9, 13 or 14. However MP Nalin Bandara said in a statement that Mr. Premadasa cannot make it during those days as he has planned to hold a few conferences including a women's conference and a farmer's conference.",
    "Mr. Premadasa also in a public meeting said he is willing to have a debate with his NPP counterpart in May but not on the days proposed by Dr. Jayatissa. \"We should have two debates which include the one between the leaders of the two parties and the other between the economic expert teams of both parties,\" he said."
