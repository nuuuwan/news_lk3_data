    "In celebration of World Children\u2019s Day 2025, Sri Lanka Insurance Life (SLIC Life) proudly extended a Rs. 1 million free life insurance cover to the parents of every child born on October 1st across the island. Now in its fourth consecutive year, the initiative reflects SLIC Life\u2019s mission to provide financial protection to families at crucial moments while reinforcing the value of life insurance as a safety net.",
    "This free life cover provides parents of newborns with vital financial security during uncertain times, helping families lay a stable foundation for the future. On October 1st, SLIC Life implemented the programme nationwide, covering every hospital in Sri Lanka to ensure parents across the country benefitted from this unique offering.",
    "Launched in 2022 as part of SLIC Life\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, the project was designed to protect the future of the nation\u2019s children by supporting their parents. The positive response and impact on families over the past three years inspired SLIC Life to continue the initiative, which has since grown into one of the company\u2019s most meaningful annual CSR efforts. As the national Life Insurer, SLIC Life is dedicated to uplifting the communities it serves. Its CSR agenda spans child education, community development, and cultural preservation, contributing to the long-term sustainability of Sri Lanka and strengthening the well-being of its people.",
    "To celebrate the initiative, a special event was held at Castle Street Hospital for Women, Colombo, on 1st October 2025 where representatives of SLIC Life joined hospital staff and families in marking this milestone. The gathering emphasized the importance of life insurance in securing brighter futures for children and their families.",
