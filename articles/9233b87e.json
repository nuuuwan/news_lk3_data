    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has allowed a Chinese military training ship to enter the island nation\u2019s main Colombo port as it is not a security threat to the country, Cabinet Spokesman Vijitha Herath said.",
    "The Chinese military ship will be the first foreign military vessel to Sri Lanka under the newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP) which has maintained a strong anti-Indian sentiment in the past.",
    "Strong security concerns raised by India and the U.S. have already forced the Sri Lankan government last year to temporarily ban Chinese ships coming to Sri Lanka for research purposes.",
    "\u201cChinese military training ship has been granted permission to visit Sri Lanka. There is no security threat to Sri Lanka from it,\u201d Hearth told the weekly Cabinet news briefing in Colombo on Tuesday (08).",
    "\u201cEven in the past, war training ships from India, the United States, and Germany have visited Sri Lanka. We have given permission for a short period.",
    "\u201cThere have been a number of military training ships from various countries. We have given permission to them. In line with that, we have given permission to this ship as well.\u201d",
    "The announcement of Chinese military ship arrival comes three days after Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar\u2019s official visit to Sri Lanka and meeting with President Dissanayake, Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, and Foreign Minister Herath.",
    "Sri Lanka government\u2019s permission for Chinese vessels have led to conflicts with India in the past.",
    "In 2014, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa allowed Chinese nuclear submarines to be docked in Colombo port without informing New Delhi authorities. India strongly raised security concerns over the Chinese submarines.",
    "Later in 2015 January, Rajapaksa lost his bid for the term presidency and he blamed the Indian intelligence agency for his defeat.",
    "In line with a 1987 pact with India, Sri Lanka has to consult India on security matters that could have an impact on the Indian Ocean.",
    "Sri Lanka has already imposed a temporary one-year ban on foreign research vessels. Herath said there is no decision taken yet on the extension of the ban.",
    "\u201cWe have not taken that decision yet. We will consider the present situation and we will take the next decision in the future,\u201d he said. (Colombo/October 08/2024)"
