  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Jaffna Monitor with a\u00a0 claim to cutting edge journalism, and with the motto \u2018Unafraid and Unbowed\u2019 had published\u00a0 in its August 2025 issue an interview with the Israeli ambassador to India and Sri Lanka. \u00a0Amplifying Israel\u2019s view seems most ill-advised at a time when the entire world is beginning to distance itself from Israel because of its genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people, at the end of a 77\u00a0 year history of land grab, ethnic cleansing, occupation and apartheid against Palestinians. Several western governments are backing Israel fully in its genocidal campaign, but the vast majority of populations in these countries,\u00a0 and globally, have turned against Israel and are protesting, marching and going to prison raising their voices against this apartheid state, and resisting the\u00a0 erasure of Palestinian life and land. \u00a0No one, let alone journalists, can claim not to know about the genocide of Palestinians. Famine, total destruction of all public infrastructure\u00a0 and many more killings of Palestinians than the official count of 70,000,\u00a0 present an apocalyptic picture.",
    "The one question posed by Jaffna Monitor to the Israeli ambassador, about the ongoing genocide, elicits an evasive response in keeping with Israeli Hasbara efforts to camouflage the truth. The ambassador ends vaguely, with a simple -an \u2018end to the war is expected\u2019, while plans to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and indeed the West Bank are afoot.",
    "The ambassador\u2019s attempts to draw historic links\u00a0 between Sri Lanka and Israel, especially with Jaffna Tamils,\u00a0 maybe as a charm offensive, is unconvincing. There was significant migration and trade across Asia, Africa and Europe\u00a0 long before colonialism. It\u00a0 is established history that Arab traders sailed all along the Indian Ocean and had fulsome links with Sri Lankan communities from the early mediaeval period. Arab traders gave\u00a0 Sri Lanka the name \u2018Serendib\u2019 from which the English word \u2018serendipity \u2018 is derived, inspired by the Arab traders\u2019 descriptions of Sri Lanka.",
    "The Israeli project of appropriating and claiming falsely, Palestinian and Arab history, culture, food\u00a0 as their own,\u00a0 resulting in an erasure of Palestinian life, is well known.",
    "The analogies between Tamils of Jaffna and the Jewish people are another feeble attempt to legitimize stronger ties and is frankly divisive. The Jaffna Monitor,  attempts to tease this out by asking a question about whether \u2018Jews and Jaffna Tamils Share Intellectual and Cultural Bonds\u2019 (sic).",
    "The dominant variant of Tamil nationalism which originated\u00a0 in Jaffna\u00a0 also has embarrassingly claimed from its inception\u00a0 that\u00a0 the Tamils\u2019 grievances are akin to that of the Jews\u2019 centuries old suffering in Europe; Tamils like the Jews\u00a0 are an \u2018educated, intelligent, industrious\u2019\u00a0 people; they were both\u00a0 persecuted similarly. Therefore this faction of Tamil nationalists claim that they also deserve an ethno- nationalist homeland like the Jews. \u00a0They ignore the fact that\u00a0 the establishment of\u00a0 Israel was an imperial\u00a0 strategy to set up a military outpost in West Asia to further western interests. \u00a0And hence the Balfour Declaration.\u00a0It was clear from the beginning that this was going to be a settler colonial project, and the \u2018ethnic transfer\u2019 (ethnic cleansing) of Palestinians was envisaged by the Zionists\u00a0 from the outset, in the early 1900s, and the colonial powers simply backed it.",
    "The Jewish homeland\u00a0 is an exclusivist ethnonationalist idea, a Jewish (Zionist) supremacist idea, and indeed because led by the European Jewry, has a nexus with White supremacy within Israel, even though White Supremacy in Europe rejected and despatched the Jews off to Palestine. The European origin Zionist settlers became hegemonic in Israel, and have established a\u00a0 racist state which is borne out by how even Jews of Arab\u00a0 and African origin are\u00a0 treated in Israel, let alone Palestinians.",
    "It is with this Zionist supremacist state that the Sri Lankan government is\u00a0 doing business and even sending its workers to be racially abused.",
    "It is also disturbing that the ambassador states that Israeli Sri Lankan relations will\u00a0 develop with the support of India.\u00a0 Under the BJP government, India has become a strategic military and economic ally of Israel, abandoning the previous years of political and diplomatic solidarity with the Palestinians. India today is one of the largest procurers of Israeli weapons systems, the most lucrative export commodity of Israel.\u00a0India is now a major seller of drones to Israel which are taking out thousands of innocent civilian life including children. Modi\u2019s close business ally Adani owns the Haifa port terminal,\u00a0 and Tata, an Indian multinational is very much implicated in digital services to the Israeli military. Hindutva fascism and Zionism have made a deadly ideological pact, and there are similarities to what both these states are pursuing\u00a0 in terms of\u00a0 land grabs, house demolitions, detentions and disappearances. In Delhi, and in surrounding states, the minority Muslim community is facing\u00a0 mob lynchings, house demolitions, land grabs, disenfranchisement , and\u00a0 statelessness like in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. These same practices are\u00a0 played out with much greater intensity by the Hindu fascist government of BJP in Kashmir, which was never part of India and is an Indian-occupied region since 1948. \u2018Akhand Bharat\u2019 and \u2018Greater Israel \u2018are the end goals of these two fascist ideologies.",
    "This sounds ominous considering Sri Lanka\u2019s weakened position vis- a- vis India.",
    "It almost feels as if Sri Lanka is in danger of ceding its foreign policy\u00a0 initiatives to India, judging from the increasing involvement with Israel.",
    "The ambassador brushes aside Sri Lankan people\u2019s concerns over the penetration of our beach resorts and countryside by ex-IDF soldiers\u00a0 and the problems that arise locally.\u00a0 The ambassador has weak words of assurances that these Israeli tourists\u00a0 are\u00a0 innocent\u00a0 young people or families. \u00a0Ex- IDF soldiers arriving for \u2018Rest and Recreation\u2019\u00a0 on completing their tour of\u00a0 military duty in Gaza and the West Bank have also caused problems in other parts of the world, such as in Goa and Himachal Pradesh , Thailand, and\u00a0 other beach resorts in Europe and\u00a0 Latin America.\u00a0Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Belgium are looking into starting legal action against ex-IDF soldiers who have been\u00a0 identified as having committed war crimes during the Gaza genocide.",
    "It is sad that our government is too timorous to challenge the Israeli tourists\u2019 behaviour, their sense of entitlement, especially with organising religious houses and restaurants where local people are not allowed. Some are reported to be overstaying their visas and are getting caught up with illegal transactions and conflict with locals.",
    "The ambassador is carrying out his hasbara\u00a0 duty in an interview that largely comes across as a puff piece, embellishing historic links and\u00a0 potential for future relations with Sri Lanka. But what is concerning is why Jaffna Monitor and other Sri Lankan journalists are taking\u00a0 pains to amplify\u00a0 the cause of an apartheid state that is carrying out a genocide at the present time.",
    "As for Jaffna Monitor\u2019s publishing of Rohan Gunaratna\u2019s (the \u2018terrorism expert\u2019 ) article , I feel it is pointless to even comment as the facts and the analysis are all taken from the Zionist playbook or from Trump speak. The Palestine question is not about religion but about land and imperialism.",
    "What is concerning\u00a0 is that the pieces on Palestine in the Jaffna Monitor are both from the Zionist point of view. Where are the Palestinian voices?",
    "It appears that Sri Lankan journalists have been sponsored en masse to visit Israel in recent weeks.\u00a0 These all-expenses-paid\u00a0 press junkets with perks are one of the most powerful ways in which Israel tries to muzzle foreign journalists into becoming\u00a0 their mouth pieces.\u00a0 The\u00a0 true story of the Nakba\u00a0 of 1947-48 when Israel was established, was suppressed, by Israeli and its allies, despite\u00a0 Palestinians \u2013 scholars, academics and the expelled refugees continuing to speak about it. \u00a0 Thirty years after the Nakba, the Israeli archives had to be declassified and nearly forty years after the Nakba, were the Israeli New Historians able to bring out the truth-\u00a0 the expulsions of the 750,000 Palestinians without\u00a0 a right of return and the destruction of over 500 villages. Until then, Israel was able to tout the lie that \u201cPalestine was a land without a people for a people without a land\u201d. Even today corporate media globally, yields to Israeli designs, on the basis of this lie. The Sri Lankan media class seems to have fully joined them."
