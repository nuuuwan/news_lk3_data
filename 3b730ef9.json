    "Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe has also warned not to regard the rupee \u201cas a one way bet.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is operating an ad hoc exchange rate regime buying dollars and preventing appreciation amid deflationary open market operations (selling down the central bank\u2019s Treasury bill stock which creates upward pressure on the rupee) but also staying away from intervening when some demand resumes.",
    "The volatility of the rupee has also generally widened buying and selling spreads among banks.",
    "Analysts had warned that Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee tend to depreciate as soon as private credit recovers, as the central bank prints money to cut rates under flexible inflation targeting usually in the second year of an International Monetary Fund program. (Colombo/Aug04/2023)"
