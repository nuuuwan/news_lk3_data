    "Dr. Mary Srikanthi Handy, a name that will be forever etched in the annals of selfless service and philanthropy, left an indelible mark on the world through her unwavering commitment to the welfare of humanity. Born in 1935, she was the cherished daughter of Dr. George Rajanayagam Handy and Kanmanie Handy, and her extraordinary journey of compassion and academic brilliance continues to inspire generations.",
    "From an early age, Dr. Handy displayed a remarkable passion for making a difference in the lives of others. Her early years were marked by tireless efforts to organise fundraising events for various noble causes. Notably, her commitment extended to the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association (YWCA), a non-profit organisation dedicated to empowering women through education and the eradication of racism. Dr. Handy\u2019s dedication to the YWCA reflected her deep-rooted belief in equality and social justice.",
    "Her academic journey began at the esteemed Ladies\u2019 College in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where she honed her intellectual prowess. Her insatiable thirst for knowledge led her to the United Kingdom, where she earned her Master of Science (MSc) degree at the prestigious University of Bradford. This was an early testament to her academic prowess and determination.",
    "However, Dr. Handy\u2019s quest for knowledge did not stop at the MSc; it marked the beginning of an illustrious academic journey. She ventured further, entering the University of Sussex in UK. There, she embarked on groundbreaking research in the field of motor neurone disease, which earned her a well-deserved Ph.D. Her research contributions were pivotal in advancing our understanding of this debilitating condition and underscored her intellectual brilliance.",
    "In the early 1990s, Dr. Mary Srikanthi Handy faced a pivotal moment in her life. Her beloved father, the renowned cardiologist and President of the Sri Lanka Heart Association, Dr. George Rajanayagam Handy, fell seriously ill and sadly passed away in 1995. It was her father\u2019s legacy that inspired her to create the Dr. G. R. Handy Foundation in his honour. The Foundation went on to make profound contributions to the healthcare landscape in Sri Lanka.",
    "Among the Foundation\u2019s noteworthy initiatives was the donation of a state-of-the-art cardiology ward to the Colombo General Hospital. Dr. Handy\u2019s personal involvement was unmistakable, as she visited the ward daily to ensure its upkeep. Furthermore, she established the Dr. G. R. Handy Memorial Cardiology Unit at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, bringing vital cardiac care to the Northern Province.",
    "Dr. Handy\u2019s compassion for children led her to support the Children\u2019s Heart Project and establish the Dr. G. R. Handy Memorial Trust Fund. The Fund\u2019s primary focus was sponsoring surgeries for children suffering from Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). Her tireless efforts significantly reduced waiting times and eased the financial burden on families. Along with the esteemed consultant cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Y. K. M. Lahie, over 100 children received life-saving surgeries through this program. Dr. Handy\u2019s commitment to staying at the forefront of medical advancement was unwavering, ensuring that treatment methods for ASD in Sri Lanka incorporated the latest breakthroughs and cutting-edge technology.",
    "She further solidified her commitment to children\u2019s healthcare by sponsoring a paediatric heart disease ward at the Institute of Cardiology. The G. R. Handy Scholarship for Medicine, established in collaboration with the Incorporated Trustees of the Church of Ceylon, offered a lifeline to medical students grappling with the financial burdens of their education.",
    "Dr. Mary Srikanthi Handy\u2019s impact goes beyond the realms of healthcare and academia, leaving an indelible mark on various facets of society. Her commitment to philanthropy and her tireless efforts at fundraising have not only enhanced the influence of the Dr. G. R. Handy Memorial Trust Fund but have significantly improved the well-being of individuals and communities.",
    "To perpetuate her family\u2019s legacy, Dr. Handy\u2019s benevolence extended to St. John\u2019s College in Jaffna. Alongside the college library, which bears the name of her great-grandfather, she pioneered the establishment of a cutting-edge computer laboratory, the Library Internet Browsing Centre. Her contributions further manifested in diverse initiatives such as the provision of scholarships for underprivileged yet academically gifted children at SJC, the development of a Senior School IT Lab, an agricultural improvement program, and the introduction of an English Language Development Course at Tanniyuttu Mullaitivu, all of which significantly advanced the cause of education. Dr. Handy\u2019s multifaceted impact showcases a profound dedication to uplift and empower communities through various educational avenues.",
    "The Eagle Care Trust, a charitable organisation, emerged from the generous donations of the G. R. Handy Memorial Trust Fund, including a substantial contribution from one of Dr. Srikanthi\u2019s church friends, the late John Roy Fussey. Eagle Care Trust provides considerable support to children facing various challenging medical conditions, including heart disease, renal issues, visual and hearing impairments, special needs, mental health issues, and other life-altering conditions. The Trust provides grants for medical supplies, hospital transportation, lodging, and food.",
    "In 2017, Eagle Care Trust was officially registered as a charitable organisation in Sri Lanka. The organisation\u2019s mission is to make a significant difference in the lives of children confronting diverse medical conditions, special needs, and mental health challenges. The legacy of Dr. Srikanthi Handy lives on through this noble endeavour.",
    "Dr. Srikanthi\u2019s commitment to education was all-encompassing. She extended scholarships to academically gifted children at St. John\u2019s College; improved educational facilities; provided financial assistance to children with medical needs, and even donated bicycles to facilitate school transport. She believed in empowering future generations with practical skills that would benefit not only them but also their communities.",
    "Her dedication to uplifting women, a principle embedded in her early work with the YWCA, continued with her funding of social housing for widows in Jaffna. In collaboration with Zonta International, a global organisation committed to improving the lives of women and girls, she built 16 houses in the village of Ariyalai, her father\u2019s birthplace.",
    "In August 2023, Dr. Mary Srikanthi Handy peacefully passed away, leaving a legacy of compassion and generosity. Her survivors include her son, Prof. Paul Rohan Mather, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. In her final years, despite her failing health, Dr. Srikanthi\u2019s commitment to helping others never wavered. Her legacy endures through her generous bequest to a fund designed to assist disadvantaged children in receiving an education.",
    "In a world often marked by self-interest, Dr. Srikanthi\u2019s life serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring power of selflessness and the profound impact one person can have on the lives of so many. Her tireless advocacy for the educational and medical rights of women, children, and the underprivileged lives on through the Eagle Care Trust and the various charitable funds she established. Her memory will forever be a beacon of hope and inspiration for those who strive to make the world a better place through acts of compassion and generosity.",
