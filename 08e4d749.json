    "Accuses Govt. of creating divisions and mistrust among people through program",
    "Says Govt. MPs and Ministers appear to be collecting appeals from people to avoid public dissent",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) National Executive Council Member Vijith Herath yesterday called the Government\u2019s calls for the submission of appeals from citizens regarding the Aswesuma social welfare program a mere deception.",
    "\u201cOfficials or others cannot be faulted for the serious mistakes made when choosing beneficiaries. It is the fault of Government policy,\u201d he said while addressing the media briefing held at the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) head office in Pelawatta yesterday.\u00a0 Herath noted that Government MPs and Ministers are now collecting appeals from the public themselves. \u201cThis is merely yet another deceptive tactic to suppress any dissent,\u201d he claimed.",
    "\u201cOver the span of six months, they have eradicated 400,000 families from the recipients of social welfare. By March 2023, an additional 400,000 vulnerable families were also excluded,\u201d he revealed. \u201cThe remaining 800,000 families shall receive Rs. 8,500 for three years until the program\u2019s conclusion,\u201d he added.",
    "According to Herath during a crisis situation, it is the duty of the Government to intervene in implementing a strong social welfare program. \u201cInstead they have curtailed the benefits of those who were beneficiaries to date. This must stop,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile also addressing the press conference, NPP MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya accused the decision-makers of the Government of being far removed from the grassroots.",
    "\u201cThey requested the people to appeal through an App. But they are clueless as to if the people who are suffering due to poverty have the necessary technology-related knowledge or devices to do so,\u201d she said.",
    "The MP noted that people were forced to pay a fee to communication centres to lodge their appeals and the Government only allowed for written appeals later after realising the failure of the system implemented.",
    "Amarusuriya also accused the Government of persecuting those who are already suffering in dire circumstances and attempting to gain political mileage from the situation.",
    "The MP warned the program could also lead to clashes within the community. \u201cWhen people look into who made the cut to receive benefits, clashes will be inevitable,\u201d she said. According to Amarasuriya, instead of fostering a sense of harmony, the Government is attempting to divide the people and create mistrust and chaos."
