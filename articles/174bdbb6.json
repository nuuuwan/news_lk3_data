    "(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: A Maverick with a Midas touch, biography of Nahil Wijesuriya)",
    "Nahil and the family moved to London and Nahil decided to continue staying in the UK, living at College Gardens in Dulwich. The children were 10 and 12 years old and the family enjoyed living here.The real estate market in the UK was at an interesting paradigm. The regulations for rates were based on the square footage of a property with the taxable rate being any area above five square feet.",
    "The basement areas under the regulated height were used for storage, considering this space was not taxable. Over the years the rules changed with taxes based on the regions etc. Nahil took advantage of the changes in tax regulations, adding an extra floor by digging into the basement of his property up to foundation level, creating a seven-foot basement which was the regular height and space, equivalent to an extra floor thus adding more value to his property.",
    "He re-modelled and sold around 20 gated properties, one of which belonged to Margaret Thatcher, who served as the Prime Minister of Britain from 1979 to 1990, situated at 11, Hambeldon Place, built by Barret Homes. This was an exclusive gated community, a one of its kind built by Barret Homes. The other property belonged to Samantha Fox, an English singer, a song writer, actress and former glamour model which he bought at a concessionary rate from Martin, a well-known property developer, during a slump in the market.",
    "On a sales trip to Hong Kong, Martin took his portfolio which included these two properties, selling both almost immediately upon his arrival to two parties in Hong Kong who snapped them up at a premium price. Nahil lived in most of these houses before they were sold. The properties were scattered around London in areas like College Gardens, Coniston Place and Central London.",
    "Plaza Estate in Marble Arch was the largest estate agency in Central London, headed by an extremely pleasant Jewish boy, Ethan Fox, through whom Nahil was buying and selling properties. Generally,",
    "as an exclusive agent, you get 1.5% of the sale value whereas a non-exclusive agent gets 2%. Nahil mentioned to Ethan that getting just 1.5% on sales was too low, he should take a look at his portfolio listings where there is always a 5-7-10 percent discount offered on the list price of a property.",
    "Nahil made a deal with him. He challenged Ethan that if he could convince a property owner to discount a further 10%, Ethan would receive 30% of that reduction. Here he had a conflict of interest, with the deal offered to him by Nahil stumping him. He is supposed to be looking after the interest of the seller, who expects a maximum price, driving up his 1.5% commission margin. Nahil was offering him a higher margin at a lower point of the sale price, basically generating a higher percentage at a lower price. This was a reverse incentive on the price.",
    "This scheme was devised by Nahil only for Ethan and not the company he worked for. Nahil bought several properties through Ethan who followed his advice. After a few deals, Nahil would ask him how things were, inviting him for a beer. While sipping their beers, they never discussed the sale. After the beer, Nahil would leave a packet of cash for him on the bar counter, and leave, just like in the movies!",
    "During his property development era in the UK, Vijitha attended Dulwich College and Anika St. James\u2019s Public School. Three of the houses developed by him were next to Dulwich College. As he sold one, the family would move to his younger sister Kanthi\u2019s home she lives in the vicinity too.",
    "While they were living at 11, Hambeldon Place, Roshanne\u2019s mother May, would stay with them periodically. One morning going through his mail, Nahil found a letter from a law firm enclosing an invoice for consultation addressed to May, mailed to his address.",
    "Nahil opened the letter from Messrs. Pike, legal consultants for Roshanne, and found pertained to Roshanne and May seeking advice on what rights she had to the custody of the kids and Nahil\u2019s properties. The first thing that crossed his mind was that British Law was much tougher than Sri Lankan, especially in instances of child custody. With the alarm bells ringing in his head, he called his sister, gave her a brief overview pertaining to the seriousness of the situation and told her he was heading back home on the first available flight with Vijitha, since Anika had gone out of town with May and Roshanne.",
    "Owing to the urgency of the situation, his sister booked them on a business class flight due to the unavailability of economy class seats. He says, \u201cThis kind of behaviour in Roshanne was always instigated by May.\u201d Nahil was on his way to the airport with Vijitha, when he realized that he was in his Bata slippers worn because it was a hot summer day. That\u2019s how fast he wanted to leave the UK.",
    "Once he boarded the flight, he found himself sitting next to Sarath Amunugama, a friend who was a fellow Trinitian, who spotted his Bata slippers and figured that he must have left in a hurry. He says, \u201cMachang, what\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Sarath had just been appointed Minister of Finance. As Nahil congratulated him on his recent appointment, he requested that Nahil drop in at his office the following day.",
    "Nahil was there at 7a.m. as requested not knowing that it was Sarath\u2019s first day in office. They had a great chat relating funny stories, to each other and reminiscing about their college days at the \u2018best school of all,\u2019 when he realized he had spent over a hour-and-a-half chatting. As Nahil left Sarath\u2019s office, he noticed people queued up, waiting to see Sarath. He was sure most of them would have assumed that his meeting with Sarath was very productive, considering the time spent.",
    "During the time Roshanne was pregnant by him and the saga was going on even though she was of the consenting age of 18 he was considered a lecher, in getting his friend\u2019s daughter pregnant. Feeling guilty, at her request he bought May a house which she had viewed in Maida Vale, London, which she later rented out and then sold. The proceeds from the sale of the house was the cash she brought back to Sri Lanka, to make a fresh start considering she was broke when he helped the family get to the UK.",
    "She bought a house in Hantana, Kandy, and with the balance money, built up her capital. After he got back to Colombo from the UK, Roshanne and Anika stayed back in London for a brief period. Roshanne had a close friend in London named Jonathan with whom she had purchased a flat somewhere in London and they were renting it out.",
    "As a three-month-old infant, in December of 1966 Roshanne was handed over by her mother into the care of a Catholic children\u2019s home in Gampola where she was cared for by nuns until she was six years old. In 1972 her mother, who was residing overseas, returned to Sri Lanka and took Roshanne back to her custody. Finally after six years Roshanne was re-united with her family.",
    "In 2018, Nahil managed to trace the address of the children\u2019s home which he visited on Roshanne\u2019s birthday in order to make a donation in her name. While there he was shown the register pertaining to the year 1966 which had details of Roshannes\u2019 time at the home.",
    "After Roshanne\u2019s demise in 2002, Nahil had a great deal of correspondence with Jonathan concerning the flat, which was now up for sale. This was to inquire from Jonathan how he intended splitting the",
    "proceeds from the sale between Nahil\u2019s kids and himself. Finally, Nahil\u2019s lawyer in Golders Green sorted out Roshanne\u2019s part of the proceeds from the sale of the flat.",
