    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lankan authorities will build their capacity in handling foreign research vessels during the one-year temporary ban on such ships, but they are in a dilemma on responding to research ships which request for replenishments or crew change, government sources said.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government has temporarily halted foreign research ships after strong security concerns raised by neighbour India and the United States after the visit of two Chinese research vessels.",
    "\u201cThe government wants to use this one year to build our capacity in handling foreign research ships,\u201d a top government source who has the insight of the strategy told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cIt is not about banning Chinese ships as the Indian media claimed. The decision was also not due to Indian pressure. Basically, Sri Lanka will not allow any research ship from any countries in the next one year.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut now we are in a dilemma on what to do when a Chinese research ship requests for replenishment or crew change,\u201d the second government source, who is aware of the government\u2019s move on the foreign ships, told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cFor instance, the first Chinese research ship in August 2022 came for replenishment. But India still raised concerns and asked us not to allow that because of possible regional security threats.\u201d",
    "\u201cNow, we have to decide on how to respond in such a situation under this one-year period. So far we are in a dilemma.\u201d",
    "Foreign Minister Ali Sabry last month said the government has introduced a SOP (Standard Operation Procedure) for foreign research vessels and all other vessels circulated among the countries which have sent their military vessels during the last 10 years.",
    "The island nation is facing geopolitical concerns over permitting Chinese research ships to dock in the Indian Ocean Island nation\u2019s ports and do surveys.",
    "Two Chinese research ships were allowed to dock in Sri Lanka ports within 14 months with one called for replenishment and the other for research.",
    "China has also sought approval from Sri Lankan authorities for another research ship early next year. Until the temporary one-year halt, Sri Lankan authorities did not grant approval for the third ship as the new request came without a local partner and the research area was decided by Beijing.",
    "India, the closest neighbour of Sri Lanka, has raised concerns over the two previous research ships citing the possibility of \u201cspying\u201d in the Indian Ocean which is a threat to them.",
    "Chinese research ship Shi Yan 6 arrived in Sri Lanka in October last year and docked in Colombo port, for what Beijing citing was for \u201cgeophysical scientific research\u201d in collaboration with the island nation\u2019s National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA).",
    "India uses the Colombo port as its main transshipment hub and accounts for around 70 percent of the total transshipment volume of the port.",
    "\u201cWe are sandwiched between the two superpowers because China has been sending research ships just to annoy India,\u201d a political leader close to President Wickremesinghe told EconomyNext.",
    "The government\u2019s one-year halt comes amid neighbouring India\u2019s concerns about China\u2019s growing influence in the Indian Ocean as well as ahead of upcoming presidential polls in the second half of 2024.",
    "Political analysts say India has influence in the Sri Lankan election given it is closely connected with ethnic minority Tamils including those who came down to the island nation from India as plantation workers during the British rule.",
    "In August 2022, Chinese navy vessel Yuan Wang 5 docked at Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka for replenishment. (Colombo/Jan 05/2023)"
