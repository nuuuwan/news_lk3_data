    "Donald Trump won South Carolina\u2019s Republican primary on Saturday, easily beating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state and further consolidating his path to a third straight GOP nomination.",
    "Trump has now swept every contest that counted for Republican delegates, adding to previous wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Haley is facing growing pressure to leave the race but says she\u2019s not going anywhere despite losing the state where she was governor from 2011 to 2017.",
    "A 2020 rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden is becoming increasingly inevitable. Haley has vowed to stay in the race through at least the batch of primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, but was unable to dent Trump\u2019s momentum in her home state despite holding far more campaign events and arguing that the indictments against Trump will hamstring him against Biden.",
    "The Associated Press declared Trump the winner as polls closed statewide at 7 p.m. That race call was based on an analysis of AP VoteCast, a comprehensive survey of Republican South Carolina primary voters. The survey confirmed the findings of pre-Election Day polls showing Trump far outpacing Haley statewide.",
    "\u201cI have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now,\u201d Trump declared, taking the stage for his victory speech mere moments after polls closed. He added, \u201cYou can celebrate for about 15 minutes, but then we have to get back to work.\u201d",
    "South Carolina\u2019s first-in-the-South primary has historically been a reliable bellwether for Republicans. In all but one primary since 1980, the Republican winner in South Carolina has gone on to be the party\u2019s nominee. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012.",
    "Trump was dominant across the state, even leading in Lexington County, which Haley represented in the state Legislature. Many Trump-backing South Carolinians, even some who previously supported Haley during her time as governor, weren\u2019t willing to give her a home-state bump.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s done some good things,\u201d Davis Paul, 36, said about Haley as he waited for Trump at a recent rally in Conway. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready to tackle a candidate like Trump. I don\u2019t think many people can.\u201d",
    "At Haley headquarters on Saturday night, supporters waved her signs in front of a large projection screen showing Trump\u2019s speech, blocking it from view. That, of course, didn\u2019t make the defeat any less crushing.",
    "About an hour later, Haley took the stage and said: \u201cWhat I saw today was South Carolina\u2019s frustration with our country\u2019s direction. I\u2019ve seen that same frustration nationwide.\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t believe Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden,\u201d Haley said, later adding: \u201cI said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run. I\u2019m a woman of my word.\u201d",
    "She said she plans to head to Michigan for its primary on Tuesday \u2014 the last major contest before Super Tuesday. Still, she faces questions about where she might be able to win a contest or be competitive.",
    "Trump and Biden are already behaving like they expect to face off in November.",
    "Trump and his allies argue Biden has made the U.S. weaker and point to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia\u2019s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump has also repeatedly attacked Biden over high inflation earlier in the president\u2019s term and his handling of record-high migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
    "Trump has questioned \u2014 often in harshly personal terms \u2014 whether the 81-year-old Biden is too old to serve a second term. Biden\u2019s team in turn has highlighted the 77-year-old Trump\u2019s own flubs on the campaign trail.",
    "Biden has stepped up his recent fundraising trips around the country and increasingly attacked Trump directly. He\u2019s called Trump and his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement dire threats to the nation\u2019s founding principles, and the president\u2019s reelection campaign has lately focused most of its attention on Trump suggesting he\u2019d use the first day of a second presidency as a dictator and that he\u2019d tell Russia to attack NATO allies who fail to keep up with defense spending obligations mandated by the alliance.",
    "Haley also criticized Trump on his NATO comments and also for questioning why her husband wasn\u2019t on the campaign trail with her \u2014 even as former first lady Melania Trump hasn\u2019t appeared with him. Maj. Michael Haley is deployed in the Horn of Africa on a mission with the South Carolina Army National Guard.",
    "But South Carolina\u2019s Republican voters line up with Trump on having lukewarm feelings about NATO and continued U.S. support for Ukraine, according to AP VoteCast data from Saturday\u2019s primary. About 6 in 10 oppose continuing aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.",
    "Only about a third described America\u2019s participation in NATO as \u201cvery good,\u201d with more saying it\u2019s only \u201csomewhat good.\u201d",
    "Haley has raised copious amounts of campaign money and is scheduled to begin a cross-country campaign swing on Sunday in Michigan ahead of Super Tuesday on March 5, when many delegate-rich states hold primaries.",
    "But it\u2019s unclear how she can stop Trump from clinching enough delegates to become the party\u2019s presumptive nominee for the third time.",
    "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., complimented Haley while speaking to reporters at Trump\u2019s election night party in Columbia but suggested it was time for her to drop out.",
    "\u201cI think the sooner she does, the better for her, the better for the party,\u201d Graham said. Later, the senator was greeted with boos after Trump called him to the stage to address those gathered.",
    "Trump\u2019s political strength has endured despite facing 91 criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, the discovery of classified documents in his Florida residence and allegations that he secretly arranged payoffs to a porn actress.",
    "The former president\u2019s first criminal trial is set to begin on March 25 in New York, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels in the closing weeks of his 2016 presidential campaign.",
    "Biden won South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary earlier this month and faces only one remaining challenger, Dean Phillips. The Minnesota Democratic congressman has continued to campaign in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary there, despite having little chance of actually beating Biden.",
    "Though Biden is expected to cruise to his party\u2019s renomination, he faces criticism from some Democrats for providing military backing to Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some in his party support a ceasefire as the death toll in Israel\u2019s war has reached 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The war could hurt the president\u2019s general election chances in swing states like Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American population."
