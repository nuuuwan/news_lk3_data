Colombo, April 1 (Daily Mirror) - The recent reduction of Petrol 95 Octane by Rs.7 and super diesel by Rs. 72 shows which sections of society were most affected by the economic difficulties, All-Island Three-Wheeler Drivers’ Union (AITWDU) President Lalith Dharmasekera said.

While criticising the recent fuel price revision, he said the people who use super diesel were affected the most by the economic difficulties.

"However, based on the fuel revision formula, the decision-makers chose not to lower the prices of auto diesel and petrol 92 Octane. They reasoned that since most passenger services heavily rely on auto diesel and many three-wheeler operators use petrol 92 Octane, they believed that people who depend on these fuels will somehow manage to endure any hardships that may arise," he said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings said it has affirmed AMW Capital Leasing And Finance PLC’s (AMWCL) National Long-Term Rating at ‘BBB(lka)’. The outlook remains negative.

“AMWCL’s rating reflects our expectation that its parent, Associated Motor Ways (Pvt) Limited (AMW), would provide extraordinary support to the finance subsidiary, if required,” Fitch said.

“The Negative Outlook on AMWCL’s rating reflects the pressure stemming from its parent’s credit profile. A prolonged ban on vehicle imports continues to impede AMW’s core business of vehicle importation and sales, weakening its earnings capacity and liquidity position.”

AMW was one of Sri Lanka’s largest vehicle importers prior to the curbs. Sri Lanka has gradually rolled back import restrictions limited vehicle classes, but curbs remain on AMW’s primary segment – passenger cars, Fitch said.
