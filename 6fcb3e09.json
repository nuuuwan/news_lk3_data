    "A former US Air Force intelligence officer told Congress that the U.S. government has a long-standing program that retrieves unidentified flying objects, and said that \u201cnon-human\u201d \u201cbiologics\u201d were found at crash sites where the objects were recovered.",
    "Retired Maj. David Grusch testified to a House committee Wednesday as part of an investigation into reports of unidentified aerial phenomena.",
    "In 2021, the Pentagon created a group to look into the phenomena after more than 100 sightings were reported. By the following year, the Pentagon said it had received \u201cseveral hundreds\u201d of new reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. The Pentagon has not confirmed that it has a program to retrieve unidentified flying objects.",
    "Grusch, who served for 14 years as an intelligence officer in the Air Force, told Congress he served as a representative on two Pentagon task forces investigating unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, until earlier this year.",
    "In his testimony, Grusch told lawmakers he was informed of \u201ca multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program\u201d during the course of his work.",
    "Asked by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) if the U.S. government also has the \u201cbodies of the pilots who piloted this craft,\u201d Grusch suggested it might.",
    "\u201cAs I\u2019ve stated publicly \u2026 biologics came with some of these recoveries, yeah,\u201d Grusch said.",
    "\u201cNon-human,\u201d Grusch responded. \u201cAnd that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge of the program I talked to, who are currently still in the program.\u201d",
    "Grusch said in June that the federal government has multiple crafts of \u201cnon-human\u201d origin.",
    "\u201cWell, naturally, when you recover something that\u2019s either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots and, believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds, it\u2019s true,\u201d Grusch told NewsNation at the time.",
    "Ryan Graves, a former Navy pilot, testified at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that he nearly collided with an unidentified object in 2014. He said in the years since he\u2019s talked to others in the Navy who have described similar experiences.",
    "\u201cWe were primarily seeing dark grey or black cubes inside of a clear sphere,\u201d Graves said of the craft he saw. \u201cWhere the apex, or tips of the cube, were touching the inside of that sphere.\u201d",
    "Former Navy pilot Dave Fravor testified that he saw a \u201cTic Tac\u201d-shaped object during a flight off the coast in California in 2004. He and his co-pilot during the incident, Lt. Cmdr. Alex Dietrich, previously spoke to CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about the experience, describing that the object appeared to reach speeds so quickly it seemed to disappear.",
    "Fravor told Congress he believes more pilots are reporting their findings now that there is less of a stigma surrounding the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena.",
    "\u201cStarting in 2017, when it all actually came out, it took that stigma away,\u201d Fravor said. \u201cPrior to that, if you had mentioned UAP you\u2019d be laughed off the Hill, and now we\u2019re sitting here today for a public testimony on what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d",
    "This July is the hottest month in 120,000 years, say scientists",
    "Dental and Kidney surgeries likely to be delayed due to medicine shortage"
