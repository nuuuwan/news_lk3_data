“Persistently high interest rates could raise borrowing costs further and affect financial stability if fiscal improvements do not offset higher real rates amid lower potential growth.

Global inflation went up after economic bureaucrats in the US, UK, Europe and many other countries printed money and states also expanded spending during Coronavirus, using some of the printed money.

*2024-07-17 06:30:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188606) · `ta`

Ranil Wickremesinghe's victory in the upcoming presidential election seems inevitable despite accusations of election dismissal conspiracies. The President's Labor Relations Commissioner assures his commitment to holding the election promptly. Opposition attempts to delay the election through legal challenges have been unsuccessful, including a case questioning the president's term length and another seeking re-election. These efforts are seen as part of a broader strategy to obstruct Wickremesinghe's candidacy. Despite the chaos, Wickremesinghe remains determined to proceed with the election as an independent candidate, confident in securing the majority vote.

🟩

Neither Ranil Wickremesinghe nor the government has taken any indirect action to postpone the presidential election. But the opposition is accusing Ranil Wickremesinghe of conspiracy to dismiss the election. But Ranil Wickremesinghe is determined to hold the election in a timely manner, said the President's Labor Relations Commissioner Saman Ratnapraya.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the United National Party headquarters in Sirikotha on Tuesday (16).

A few are acting indirectly to overcome the presidential election. Last week, a dealer had questioned the president's tenure and sued the High Court.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe immediately acted and confirmed that the president's tenure was five years and had given the Attorney General's Department to the Attorney General's Department to take action in the High Court.. Accordingly, the case was dismissed.

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution Bill, the legal effect of which would be that a Bill that seeks to extend the term of office of the President or the duration of Parliament to over five years would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the People at a Referendum. The Bill seeks to amend present Article 83(b), according to which the maximum period to which such term or duration can be extended without a Referendum is six years. Article 83 also states that any Bill that seeks to amend Article 83 itself would require a two-thirds majority and approval at a Referendum. Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the proposed Bill will require a two-thirds majority and a Referendum.

The 1983 July violence was the worst ever violence perpetuated against a section of the community which remains the darkest era of Sri Lanka’s history

Extracted from my memoirs “Pinnacle of five decades of banking – a journey beyond”

It was during the rough and tumble of the difficult environment which prevailed in the country as a whole, I had to perform my responsibilities in a branch far away from my residence, most importantly away from my family.

It was this routine and without any exaggeration to say my commitment and dedication to my responsibilities which took me to Nawalapitiya on that fateful day of “Black July” of Monday 25 July, 1983 which remains as Sri Lanka’s darkest era.

The revival program recently initiated by CBSL is a big opportunity for the banks to reduce their non-performing balance via rehabilitating the distressed customers while contributing to the national economy of Sri Lanka

A credit decision of a bank is inextricably associated with credit risk due to the micro and macroeconomic conditions which are beyond the control of the customer. Hence, the repayment capacity of the borrower can be affected by unpredictable circumstances; subsequently the liabilities of the bank will be transferred to non-performing category. These borrowers cannot be treated as wilful defaulters, and should be immediately remedied out by different tools and techniques like Restructuring, Rescheduling and Revival with Rehabilitation
