### கண்டனமாக மாறிய ​கொண்டம்

*2025-09-09 10:18:23* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/சிந்தனை-சித்திரம்/கண்டனமாக-மாறிய-கொண்டம்/62-364249) · `ta`

இந்த கார்ட்டூன், ஒரு வார்த்தையை எழுதி மீண்டும் எழுதும் எளிய செயல் மூலம் பொதுக் கொள்கையில் ஒரு பயங்கரமான முரண்பாட்டை அம்பலப்படுத்துகிறது.

இடதுபுறத்தில், சுகாதார அமைச்சகம் "CONDOM" என்ற சொல்லை, நீல நிற எழுத்துக்களில் எழுதுகின்றது. இதன் குறியீடு தெளிவாக உள்ளது: ஆணுறைகள் பாதுகாப்பு கருவிகளாகக் கருதப்படுகின்றன, HIV, STDகள் மற்றும் திட்டமிடப்படாத கர்ப்பங்களுக்கு எதிரான பொது சுகாதார பிரச்சாரங்களுக்கு மையமாக உள்ளன. செய்தி நடைமுறை மற்றும் தடுப்பு - தீர்ப்புக்கு முன் சுகாதாரம்.

இருப்பினும், வலதுபுறத்தில், கல்வி அமைச்சகம் அதே வார்த்தையை எடுத்துக்கொண்டு அதை "CONDEMN" என்று மாற்றுகிறது. ஒரு சிவப்பு நிற பேனாவுடன், அமைச்சகம் கதையை திறம்பட மீண்டும் எழுதுகிறது, பாதுகாப்பு செய்தியை தார்மீக நிராகரிப்புடன் மாற்றுகிறது. கீழே அமர்ந்திருக்கும் மாணவர் தெளிவாக குழப்பமடைந்து காணப்படுகிறார் - சமூகத்தின் இளைஞர்களுக்கான ஒரு நிலைப்பாடு, அவர்களை வழிநடத்த வேண்டிய நிறுவனங்களின் சமிக்ஞைகளுக்கு இடையில் சிக்கிக் கொள்கின்றனர்.

### Be converted

This cartoon exposes a terrible contradiction in public policy by a simple act of writing and rewriting a word.

On the left, the Ministry of Health writes the word "Condom" in blue letters. Its code is clear: condoms are considered safety tools, focusing on public health campaigns against HIV, STDs and unplanned pregnancy. News Practice and Prevention - Health before judgment.

However, on the right, the Ministry of Education takes the same word and transforms it to "Condemn". With a red pen, the ministry re -writes the story effectively, replacing the security message with moral rejection. The student sitting below is clearly confused - a position for the youth of the community, trapped amidst the signals of companies that need to lead them.

### Thai court orders ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail

*2025-09-09 10:13:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112311/thai-court-orders-ex-pm-thaksin-shinawatra-must-serve-one-year-in-jail) · `en`

Thailand’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail because his detention in a VIP wing of a hospital in lieu of prison was unlawful, in another major blow for a powerful family that has dominated politics for two decades.

The judges said Thaksin did not have severe illness and his hospitalisation could not be counted as time served, adding the responsibility did not solely lie with the doctors and that the polarising billionaire intentionally prolonged his hospital stay.

Thaksin was seen at the court removing his jacket and getting into a corrections department van.

In a statement on Facebook, the tycoon said he accepted the verdict and would stay strong.

“Today, I may no longer have freedom, but have freedom of thought to create benefit for the country and people,” Thaksin said.

Popular anger spilled into the streets of the Nepali capital after the government moved last week to block social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube, in a move that was widely criticized by rights groups as a tool for censorship.

The government had claimed the ban was needed to clamp down on fake news and hate speech and accused the companies of failing to register.

In 2016, Parliament established the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) to trace thousands unaccounted for during the war, and in 2018 the Office for Reparations was created to address the needs of victims and their families.

### Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power faces legacy of civil war

*2025-09-08 22:42:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-National-People-s-Power-faces-legacy-of-civil-war/4-781381) · `en`

President Anura Kumara Disanayake and his National People’s Power Government are struggling to build a more stable, inclusive political culture in Sri Lanka. A mix of bold action and political skill will be needed. Support from the UN Human Rights Council can help.

The election of President Anura Kumara Disanayake in September 2024, and the landslide parliamentary victory of his National People’s Power (NPP) alliance two months later, have ignited hope throughout Sri Lanka. Elected on a mandate to eliminate the widely reported large-scale corruption, nepotism and abuse of power that contributed to the country’s economic collapse in 2022, the NPP appealed to voters in large part because it lacked experience in office and was distant from the elite-dominated parties that had ruled Sri Lanka since independence in 1948. Among their more soaring goals, Disanayake and the NPP pledged to fight impunity and establish a “new political culture”.

There cannot be any doubt except in the minds of those who considered themselves as members of the “some are more equal than others” collective, that a cultural change is needed to ensure every citizen adheres to the law of the land irrespective of their status

“Some are more equal than others” is a paradoxical phrase from George Orwell’s allegorical novel Animal Farm that highlights societal hypocrisy, where the concept of equality is proclaimed but a privileged few receive preferential treatment

Theatrics in Sri Lankan politics has reached a crescendo with the arrest, remanding and bail out of Ranil Wickremesinghe, former President, Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Member of Parliament since 1977.

### Sustainable Intelligence: Data & AI For A Resilient Future

*2025-09-08 19:54:04* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sustainable-intelligence-data-ai-for-a-resilient-future/) · `en`

In the 21st century, intelligence is no longer the sole preserve of human wisdom. It now includes the vast realms of data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Yet intelligence on its own is not enough. The same brilliance that split the atom also created fear of annihilation. The same ingenuity that mapped every corner of the Earth has failed to safeguard it.

The urgent challenge before us is to align intelligence with sustainability — intelligence that respects ecological limits, empowers communities, and ensures resilience for future generations.

Sustainable intelligence goes beyond being “smart.” It is about being wise. We can see this progression in three layers:

Nature itself models this. In a forest, trees process carbon, exchange nutrients, and even “communicate” underground. They do not optimize for growth alone but for the survival of the entire ecosystem. That is sustainable intelligence.
