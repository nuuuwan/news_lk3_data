### Govt. revenue in January surge 62% on economic turnaround, higher taxes

*2024-05-20 03:50:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Govt-revenue-in-January-surge-62-on-economic-turnaround-higher-taxes/108-282928) · `en`

The revenue to the government, including the grants, rose by a staggering 61.8 percent in January 2024. This is a result of the government raking in billions of rupees out of people’s pockets to appease the International Monetary Fund’s revenue targets.

The government revenues and grants for January were Rs.283.19 billion, out of which Rs.257.57 billion was raised via taxes. This was 63.8 percent higher from the same period last year.

The staggering increase in the tax revenues in January compared to the same month in 2023 was predominantly due to the recovering economy which was supported further by the 3 percent increase in the value added tax rate from January 1, 2024 onwards.

Between then and now, there wasn’t a single other tax imposed or raised except for the value added tax, and hence the bulk of the growth in tax income came from the recovering economy due to the normalising foreign currency inflows.

It seems like you've shared a detailed perspective on the political and social dynamics surrounding the Tamil people's relationship with the Sri Lankan state, focusing on issues of rights, representation, and the impact of electoral processes on their struggle for recognition and autonomy.

4. **International Recognition and Support**: The importance of international community involvement and support in addressing the Tamil people's plight.



5. **Historical and Current Injustices**: A recounting of historical injustices faced by the Tamil people, including forced displacement, denial of resettlement rights, and the lack of accountability for human rights abuses.

🟩

The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) has called for a complete boycott until the unity of the Sri Lankan presidential election will be eliminated and the federal guarantee is granted.

The party said in a clarification report on the presidential election titled 'We will be thinking of the welfare of Tamil Nadu'.

In the Tamil nation, the Tamil Nadu state is acting as an enemy of the Tamil nation by continuing the Sinhala Buddhistization, militarization and systematic ethnic process through the construction of the ethnic groups.. The Sri Lankan government, which considers the Tamils to cause any crisis as long as the majority representation within the unity state structure is in their hands, is maintaining the interests of the Sinhalese nation, not considering the Tamil people as its enemies.

### Sri Lanka’s political paradox: Prioritising privileges over public interest

It is high time for Sri Lanka to break free from the shackles of corrupt political culture that prioritises personal gain over public welfare

In the bustling chambers of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, a disheartening spectacle unfolds with disturbing regularity – elected officials engaged not in constructive debate for the betterment of the nation, but in heated exchanges and even physical altercations. Yet, behind the façade of discord lies a disconcerting unity among MPs when it comes to safeguarding their own interests and privileges, even at the expense of the struggling populace.

In a country where rap is illegal, Toomaj chose rap to challenge Iran’s hardline regime

In a country where rap is illegal, Toomaj chose rap to challenge Iran’s hardline regime which doesn’t tolerate dissent. Now he’s facing the death penalty for refusing to back down.

This is part of a terrifying crackdown on the “Women, Life, Freedom” protests that have swept through the entire country since the killing of Jina Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman arrested in 2022 for  not covering her head properly. She died in police custody three days later, and was posthumously awarded the 2023 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The prize was shared between her and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in Iran.

People all around the world are calling for Toomaj’s release. In Iran,  he’s become a national hero for all those who continue to resist the regime at great personal risks.

The Office of United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) on Friday the17th issued a strident call to the Sri Lanka Government (SLG) to urgently establish an independent prosecutorial authority, appoint a special prosecutor and create special courts to try those accused of gross violations of international law and serious breaches of international humanitarian law.

In its report on accountability for enforced disappearances in our country, the OHCHR has suggested enhancing the capabilities of the Office on Missing Persons ensuring thorough investigation into mass graves and the prosecution of those responsible for these crimes.

From the early 1970s our country has faced three armed uprisings -the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) insurgency of 1971, the near three-decade ethnic war of 1983 and the JVP uprising in 1989.

According to the World Bank, our manufacturing industry was responsible for 25% of Sri Lanka’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023

Just 6,000 industrial entities account for 93% of the industrial electricity

The CEA is now working to change the application process so that companies will be required to provide greenhouse gas-related data

Some industrial sectors are making changes to adopt renewable technologies

Of the 70,000 industrial entities supplied by the CEB, 350 consume 42% of all industry sector electricity

To change something, first you have to understand it. But unless you fully understand what you are trying to change, you will be moving forward with your eyes closed. You will be struggling to understand the situation as you will be feeling your surroundings in the dark.

Those pure black or white people we have seen through a bird’s eye will suddenly disappear and, instead, appear as a mixture of blackness and whiteness making it almost impossible to pass any clear judgment. On one occasion, they are pure white but commences a process of transformation that ends finally in pure blackness

Asoka Handagama is notorious for challenging our cognitive capacity through his artwork, be it through poetry, fiction, stage drama, teledrama, or movies. His newest stage drama, ‘A Death in an Antique Shop’, is the best, or worst in some sense, in this tradition.
