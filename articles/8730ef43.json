    "The Secretary to the Ministry of Trade M.M. Naimuddin\u00a0accused rice mill owners of creating an artificial shortage in local markets to drive up prices, and he promised immediate measures to address the issue.",
    "Meanwhile, the Maradagahamula Rice Traders\u2019 Association says that due to the shortage and high prices of certain types of rice in the market, the sale of rice has dropped by about 50%.",
    "In recent weeks, rice prices in the market have exceeded the government control price, with a noted shortage of Nadu rice.",

Subsequently, on November 06, the Consumer Affairs Authority submitted a comprehensive report to the President, in line with his directive to promptly provide data on the country\u2019s paddy and rice stock levels.",
