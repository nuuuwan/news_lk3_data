Vadivel Suresh Pradeesh discusses plantation worker salaries, youth education issues, and women's rights during election campaign. Emphasizes need for parliamentary representation to address these concerns.

🟩

He held a discussion with the public during the election campaign in Lindulai Lipakkalai this evening.

Speaking on the occasion, Vadivel Suresh Pradeesh said the workers' salary issue was important but I could not speak out of the house without going to parliament.

Similarly, a large number of youth from the hill country are working in Colombo. But they had no protection, and in the past, night schools were more likely to be over the past but it is now completely gone. Thus the academic activity has been affected. No one finds the plantation workers who have been suffering for a long time.

Similarly, if you want to get all these in the future, you have to win the parliamentary election and elect a Member of Parliament if all of them are available in the future.

Thus, if I win the parliamentary election and go to parliament, I will be able to make a compulsory respect for the military workers.

A protest outside the Bangladeshi president’s home demanding his resignation ended when demonstrators clashed with riot police while trying to storm the compound, with 30 injured in the melee.

President Mohammed Shahabuddin’s powers are largely ceremonial but he played a pivotal role at the height of an August student revolution that ousted autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.

Shahabuddin announced his one-time ally had quit on the day she fled the country for neighbouring India, paving the way for the caretaker administration now running the South Asian country.

But last week he said in a local media interview he had not actually seen a written letter from Hasina to that effect -raising the prospect that her resignation was unlawful.

Protesters began gathering outside Shahabuddin’s compound in the capital Dhaka on Tuesday demanding he step down and accusing him of residual loyalty to Hasina and her Awami League party.
