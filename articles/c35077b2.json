  "original_title": "Bradman Weerakoon :  The Man for all Seasons who Served Nine Sri Lankan  Premiers and Presidents with Dedication.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u201cSir Donald George Bradman was, without any question, the greatest phenomenon in the history of cricket, indeed in the history of all ball games\u201d. This was how well-known journalist and visiting professor at Oxford University Mathew Engel  referred to   Don Bradman in an essay about the famous Australian cricketer in the Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanack. According to \u201cCricketinfo\u201d, \u201c Sir Donald Bradman of Australia was, beyond any argument, the greatest batsman who ever lived and the greatest cricketer of the 20th century\u201d.",
    "Don Bradman  bestrode the world of cricket like a Colossus in the mid-twentieth Century. He became the toast of Cricket lovers in the then British Empire after he scored  an unbeaten 452 for New South Wales against Queensland in January 1930.This was a world record then for scoring the highest number of runs in an innings in First-Class cricket.",
    "Sri Lanka known earlier as Ceylon was under British rule when Bradman  made his mark in Cricket.. There was much excitement when the \u201cOrford\u201dsailed into Colombo harbour  on 2 April 1930 with the Australian cricket team touring England. Don Bradman was of course the  star attraction .On 3 April 1930, Australia played a one day match  against Ceylon at the Colombo Cricket Club (CCC) grounds in  Maitland Crescent.",
    "This was the first match played by 22 year old Don Bradman outside Australia. Bradman thrilled the spectators with sizzling strokeplay as he piled up the runs. Bradman was on 40 when 24 year old Neil Joseph was called to bowl. The old Royalist  with his first ball in International cricket got  Bradman out -hit wicket!",
    "The Australian team had a remarkable season in England, regaining the Ashes 2/1 in a 5 Test series. Don Bradman  made Cricket history in that tour. Don Bradman scored 974 runs in the Test series. His scores were 8, 131, 254, 1, 334, 14 and  232.   In the 3rd Test match at Headingley Bradman scored 309  n.o. on the first  day. His final tally of 334 runs beat the previous  highest Test record score of 287.Don Bradman  also scored 2960 runs on the tour at an average of 98.86.",
    "All these feats of Don Bradman  published in newspapers were eagerly lapped up by cricket fans in Ceylon. The Ausiie cricketers returned to Australia by the \u201c Oronsay\u201d on 28 October 1930. Enroute to Fremantle,the ship docked in Colombo on 20 October 1930. Huge crowds gathered at the harbour to cheer Bradman and  get a glimpse of  him if possible. News of Bradman sailing into Colombo was published in detail in the newspapers.",
    "It was in this climate of  \u201cBradmania\u201d  that a baby boy was born  in Colombo on  the same day (October 20) that the \u201cOronsay\u201d with Bradman  and the Aussie team sailed into the  Colombo port. The parents were  avid fans of  Don Bradman . So they named their new born son Bradman after the famous  cricketer. The boy despite being a namesake of the legendary Bradman did not become a famous cricketer, but he  did grow up to be famous as a distinguished  civil servant who served under nine former Prime ministers and presidents of Ceylon/Sri Lanka.",
    "I am of course referring to  Bradman Weerakoon who passed away on 7 July 2025 at the age of 94 . Bradman as he was generally known graduated from the University of Ceylon (Peradeniya) and joined the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service. He held several posts such as Government Agent, Permanent Secretary, Private secretary to the Prime Minister,  Commissioner -General of Essential Services and Presidential adviser  in a career spanning five decades. Bradman Weerakoon also had two stints as Secretary _general of  the International Planned Parenthood Federation(IPPF).",
    "I was fortunate to have had the opportunity of  interacting  with Bradman Weerakoon for a few years in my professional capacity as a journalist. I  entered journalism in April 1977 as a staff reporter  on the Tamil daily \u201cVirakesari\u201d. The United National Party(UNP) led by Junius Richard (JR)Jayewardene  won 141 of 168 seats at the July 1977 polls and formed a new Government.",
    "In those days reporters on newspapers were assigned specific ministries to cover for news \u2013  known as rounds or beats \u2013  as part their regular duties. One of the ministries I had to cover was the Ministry of Plantations Industries . Kottawa MP  and UNP veteran   MDH Jayawardena was the minister.His deputy was Matale MP Alick Aluwihare. The Permanent secretary to the Plantations Industries ministry  was Bradman Weerakoon. The additional secretary was Dr.PG Punchihewa.",
    "The plantations industries ministry was an important one as far as the \u201cVirakesari\u201dwas concerned .The  leading Tamil newspaper had a large readership among the plantation workers of the hill country. As such I was required to cover the ministry thoroughly. Both the secretary Weerakoon and Addl secy Punchihewa were very considerate  and kind towards me .They were  easily accessible and  quite forthcoming. I can still recall my \u201cscoop\u201din breaking the news about  the Palmyra development board  being set up under the chairmanship of veteran trade unionist KC Nythiananda",
    "It was during this phase that I interacted with Bradman Weerakoon for the first time.I was in regular contact with him those days. I soon discovered that  he did not like to answer telephone calls from the media during office hours. What I would do was to drop in at the ministry office then in Kollupitiya a few minutes before closing time and meet  Bradman Weerakoon in person. He  would  then talk freely with me. There  were a few occasions when Bradman would  give me a ride in his vehicle and continue the  conversation.",
    "Bradman Weerakoon moved out of the Plantations ministry in 1980 and became secretary to the then Prime minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. Since  I was not covering the Prime minister\u2019s office or ministries under his purview, I no longer communicated with Bradman. In 1981, I entered English journalism by joining \u201cThe Island\u201d.",
    "I began interacting with Bradman Weerakoon  once again as a journalist while on \u201cThe Island\u201d. This was  in regard to the on going dialogue between the Jayewardene Govt and the then leading Tamil political party the Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF). The objective of those regular meetings was to  discuss ways and means of reviving and taking forward the District Development Councils (DDC).Bradman was the coordinator in these meetings.",
    "Even though Bradman was only a public servant acting on instructions from the political executive, he  did take a lot of interest in these meetings. He was very concerned about the escalating ethnic crisis. He would tell me that an overwhelming number of Tamil people had voted for \u201cTamil Eelam\u201d.  He would emphasise that a meaningful alternative should be offered to the Tamil people in order to  contain secessionist tendencies.Bradman then thought the DDCs if worked properly could provide a solution. Alas! That never happened.",
    "Worse still, the situation worsened with the anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983. It was a chaotic situation to say the least. Bradman Weerakoon was appointed Commissioner -General of Essential Services in the aftermath of \u201cBlack\u201dJuly.  I continued to  interact with  Bradman ,even as he discharged his duties efficiently.  In talking to Bradman then ,I realized that he was quite disillusioned by  what had happened and also  by what was happening.",
    "I  left Sri Lanka in 1988.Communication with Bradman Weerakoon ceased.  Years later I  resumed contact with him after he started working with Ranil Wickremesinghe who became Prime Minister in 2001.  Ranil Wickremesinghe began a  Norway facilitated peace process with the LTTE. I was then writing for \u201cThe Sunday Leader\u201dfrom  Toronto .I kept in touch with Bradman regarding the peace process. This too ended  in 2004.",
    "Thereafter I   had only one lengthy telephone conversation with Bradman Weerakoon. This was in 2010 when he celebrated his 80th Birthday. Marianne David had interviewed him for the \u201cDaily FT\u201d. I re-posted the interview  on my Blog. He was happy.",
    "I then telephoned him and had a very long conversation during which we talked about many things ranging from the  \u201cKuravar\u201d(gypsies)  of  Aligambai to President Premadasa\u2019s ill-fated valet Mohideen. That was the last time I heard Bradman\u2019s voice.",
    "Bradman Robin  Weerakoon was born in Colombo on 20 October 1930. His parents hailed from Paiagala in Kalutara. Bradman\u2019s father Edmund was a Police Officer and mother Edith a school teacher. Young Bradman  had his primary education at Holy Cross College,Kalutara. He moved to the school by the sea at Mt. Lavinia for his secondary education. The outbreak and  intensification of  World War2 saw Bradman relocating to  the newly started St.Thomas\u2019 College in Gurithalawa. Bradman pursued his tertiary education at the then University of Ceylon in Peradeniyaa where he obtained a BA degree in Economics and Sociology.",
    "Thereafter Bradman  sat for the prestigious  Ceylon Civil Service examina and passed with flying colours. He  joined the CCS  and served as a cadet officer under the Government Agents of Anuradhapura and Jaffna. In 1954, Bradman was appointed Assistant secretary to the then Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawela In 1955 he became secretary to  Prime minister Kotelawela.",
    "Bradman Continued as secretary to Prime ministers SWRD  Bandaranaike, W. Dahanayake, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Dudley Senanayake from 1956 to 1970. His acceptability to successive prime ministers of different political hues   was a tribute to his integrity,efficiency and non -partisan approach.",
    "However the 1970  United Front Govt of  Sirimavo Bandaranaike shunted Bradman out of the Prime ministerial \u201ccorridors of power\u201d in Colombo into the  administrative  wilderness of the  East. Bradman served as GA of Batticaloa and then Amparai. In 1977 he became secretary of  the  Plantations Industries ministry under the JR Jayewardene regime.",
    "In 1980 Bradman returned to familiar turf once again. He  became secretary to the then Prime minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. In 1983 Bradman was appointed Commissioner -General of Essential Services. When Premadasa  became President in 1988, Bradman was  appointed Presidential adviser on International Affairs.He continued as  adviser  to  Premadasa\u2019s successor President  DB Wijetunga also.",
    "Bradman was brought out of retirement by Ranil Wiickremesinghe when  in 2001 he became Prime minister in a co-habitation Govt under President  Chandrika Kumaratunga. Bradman was once again in the saddle as secretary to the PM until 2004 when the Ranil Govt was toppled.",
    "During Bradman Weerakoon\u2019s eventful career, he twice served as Secretary -_general of  the International Planned Parenthood Federation(IPPF) in London. The first was in 1976 and the second in 1984. Bradman  was also a recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship which he utilized to acquire a  MA in Sociology from the University of Michigan, USA.",
    "Bradman spent the greater part of his blissful retirement in reading,researching and writing. As far as I remember, he wrote three memorable books. One was about his home district Kalutara known as Pasdun Korale.. Bradman was from Paiyagala.  Another was about  Ranasinghe Premadasa. Bradman admired some of Premadasa\u2019s  qualities very much.The third   was a memoir  focusing mainly on the nine Prime Ministers and  presidents he had served under. It was the most popular of his books.",
    "Bradman\u2019s parents were devout Anglicans. He too was baptized as a Christian. Yet, he became a follower of Lord Buddha\u2019s teachings in his late teens. However when Bradman  wrote his memoir \u201cRendering Unto Caesar\u201d, the title  was  inspired  by the Bible. The gospels record an incident where Jesus Christ said \u201c \u201cRender unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and unto God the things that are God\u2019s\u201d. This in essence summed up Bradman\u2019s mindset and functioning style  in working with \u201cnine  latter-day Caesars\u201d in the form of Sri Lankan Premiers and Presidents.",
    "Bradman Weerakoon married Damayanthi Gunasekara who passes away in 2007. Their only son Esala  was  a diplomat in the foreign service. Esala Weerakoon  served as Ambassador,High Commissioner, Foreign ministry secretary and  Secretary-General of SAARC.",
    "Bradman would have celebrate his 95th Birthday in October this year. Fate has willed otherwise. Bradman Weerakoon  was one of the last of the elite Ceylon Civil servants. He was a great man who worked with Prime ministers and Presidents but always retained  great concern and affection for his country and  the people of Sri Lanka.",
