එක්සත් ජාතීන්ගේ මානව හිමිකම් කවුන්සිලය විසින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාව සම්බන්ධයෙන් කළ යෝජනා සම්මතය පිළිබඳ දිලිත් ජයවීර මහතා සිය X අවකාශයේ සටහනක් තබමින් මේ බව සඳහන් කර තිබේ.

මානව හිමිකම් මණ්ඩලයේදී ශ්‍රී ලංකාව නියෝජනය කිරීමට බැඳී සිටින ඔවුන් මිලියන 22ක් වූ ජනතාවට ඒ පිළිබඳ වහා සැපයිය යුතු අතර ශ්‍රී ලංකාව සම්බන්ධයෙන් තහවුරු නොකළ චෝදනා මත පදනම් වූ යෝජනාවට පක්ෂව මිතුරු රටවල් පවා අදහස් දැක්වීම කම්පනයට පත්වන පාවාදීමක් බව ද ඔහු සිය X ගිණුමේ සටහන් කර තිබේ.

ජාත්‍යන්තර ප්‍රජාව ඉදිරියේ අපේ ජාතියේ ප්‍රමුඛතාවන් හෑල්ලුවට ලක්වීම වත්මන් රජයේ දුර්වලතාව හා අසමත්භාවය ප්‍රදර්ශනය කිරීමක් බවත් සිය සටහන මගින් වැඩිදුරටත් පෙන්වා දී ඇත.
