    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, hit by a series of crises, including a foreign currency shortage, fuel and food scarcities and a sharp decline in government revenues, is struggling to emerge from the turmoil. Besides, it has very limited policy tools to provide relief and boost output recovery, Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) Executive Director, Dr. Dushni Weerakoon said.",
    "Speaking at the recent launch of the IPS report, \u2018Sri Lanka: State of the Economy 2024\u2019, on the theme, \u201cEconomic Scars of Multiple Crises: From Data to Policy,\u201d Weerakoon said the report provides a deep analysis of the country\u2019s recovery efforts and the policy choices that will shape its future.",
    "Some100 representatives of the government, private sector and civil society gathered at the launch to discuss Sri Lanka\u2019s fragile economic recovery, dissect the root causes of its persistent challenges and to debate potential solutions.",
    "While the country is on a path to recovery, it is a delicate one, Weerakoon said.",
    "Weerakoon stressed the need for \u201cmarginal changes\u201d in tax and spending policies to address deep-rooted inequalities. These adjustments, she suggested, are the most prudent means to improve living standards in a nation that continues to reel from economic shocks. \u2018The State of the Economy 2024\u2019 report underscores the importance of refining policy strategies to ensure that they are both effective and equitable, without derailing the country\u2019s fragile recovery process, she said.",
    "\u2018The IPS report brought attention to one of the most controversial issues in Sri Lanka\u2019s post-crisis economic recovery: taxation. VAT hikes and the removal of exemptions have disproportionately impacted the country\u2019s poorest, further widening the socio-economic divide, the IPS head explained.",
    "IPS Research Economist, Priyanka Jayawardena said that households in the lowest income decile spend about 10% of their income on VAT, compared to only 6% among higher-income groups.",
    "The findings also show that while direct taxes, such as PAYE and PIT, are progressive\u2014meaning they tax the wealthy more heavily\u2014Sri Lanka is still plagued by high levels of tax evasion. In 2023, less than one-third of the estimated Rs. 131 billion payable in personal income tax was actually collected.",
    "According to Dr. Pulasthi Amerasinghe, Research Economist at IPS, the Aswesuma welfare program adopts more stringent eligibility criteria, making it a more targeted approach to social welfare. Around 54% of former Samurdhi beneficiaries qualify for Aswesuma, reflecting the programme\u2019s improved focus on deprivation indicators across 22 criteria.",
    "However, despite the programme\u2019s refined targeting mechanisms, there remain serious concerns about those left behind. As Dr. Amerasinghe noted, nearly 40% of food-insecure households, a group particularly vulnerable in times of economic crisis, were found to be ineligible under the Aswesuma criteria.",
    "IPS Director of Research, Dr. Nisha Arunatilake, revealed troubling statistics from the Labour Force Survey: 65% of young Sri Lankans aged 20-24 not being engaged in any form of education. This means that a significant portion of the country\u2019s youth is entering the labour market with low or outdated skills, which undermines their ability to compete in an increasingly digital global economy.",
    "Adding to this is the decline in high-skilled employment, which dropped from 23% in 2018 to 20% in 2023. Emigration of skilled workers, drawn by better wages abroad, has resulted in a shortage of professionals in critical sectors, such as, engineering, IT and management.",
    "Suresh Ranasinghe, IPS Research Officer, highlighted this \u201cbrain drain\u201d as a significant factor driving down managerial positions in Sri Lanka, which have halved over the past five years. The consequences of this are far-reaching: as skilled talent leaves, the country\u2019s labor market struggles to meet the demands of modern industries, thereby stifling productivity and innovation.",
