He possesses a captivating intellect and spending even a few minutes with him feels like an extraordinary privilege. He, who identified himself as an “accidental diplomat,” was Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN and then served as the President of the United Nations Security Council. Kishore Mahbubani, an esteemed scholar, diplomat, and author, is well-known for his incisive analyses of global geopolitics and economic development.

In his book The Asian 21st Century, Mahbubani presents a compelling argument for the centrality of Asia in shaping the global order of the future. He contends that the 21st century will not only be an Asian century but one where the lessons from Asian societies can provide critical insights into tackling global challenges. In this book, he emphasises that “the Asian way of thinking, characterised by pragmatism and a deep respect for the complexities of history, can offer solutions to the multifaceted problems facing humanity.”

### A truly great and noble Indian

*2024-10-27 01:49:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-truly-great-and-noble-indian/) · `en`

I have been reading and watching YouTube videos that are abundant on Ratan Tata who died about two weeks ago. He was a great man – successful businessman, clever entrepreneur, most generous philanthropist and a truly compassionate human being. My interest is enhanced by my son having given me a birthday gift about a decade ago of four days at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai, full name Taj Mahal Palace, Colaba, very near the Gateway of India.

### An important strategy to mitigate elephant-vehicle collisions

*2024-10-27 01:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/an-important-strategy-to-mitigate-elephant-vehicle-collisions/) · `en`

(Author of the award-winning book “The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants”)

According to a report by the World Bank, Sri Lanka has the highest road density in South Asia. On the other hand, Sri Lanka is a country with rich biodiversity and wildlife-collisions with trains/motorists have been there for aeons without a successful mitigating measure. This can risk the lives of wildlife as well as motorists or passengers. The latest one happened on October 18, 2024, in which two wild elephants died and two others were injured in a Batticaloa-bound fuel tanker train accident.

When considering train accidents, the best solutions would be an underground railway-transit line in wildlife-sensitive areas. But considering the economic status of the country, such projects can be difficult to initiate in the near future. So, this article proposes a strategy that can be implemented just within a few days and has a strong potential to at least mitigate the issue.

### Historicising the Sri Lanka Law College

*2024-10-27 01:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/historicising-the-sri-lanka-law-college/) · `en`

The Sri Lanka Law College, reputedly Asia’s oldest professional institution, was established 150 years ago, in 1874. Today, it has become an institution unto itself.To commemorate the anniversary, the institution came out with a publication: “Uplifting Legal Education in Sri Lanka: 150 Years of Law College.” Compressing what could have been two, if not three, years of hard research into six months, the book saw the light of day at a launch on October 18 – that is, last Friday.

The book tries to make its contribution to our society, its continuing relevance, clearer. It does this by exploring its historical evolution from multiple perspectives.

It also raises many questions. Perhaps the most important of them is this: how do institutions become relevant to the societies they inhabit, how do they become more representative of the people they serve?

To answer that question, it is necessary to go back in time.

I met Barbara Harrel-Bond, an anthropologist, by accident in April 1989. At that time, I was with the USAID-funded Mahaweli Agriculture and Rural Development Project (MARD). One day at lunchtime, an old jeep arrived at the project office. A white woman in her sixties emerged from the jeep. She was in a kurta and was carrying several notebooks in her hands. She smiled and asked me whether I could find someone who knew how Sinhala villagers interacted with Tamil villagers in the war-front area. I told her our professional staff had gone out for lunch, so she should wait until they returned.

### It’s pink for roses – and for sin

*2024-10-26 15:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/its-pink-for-roses-and-for-sin/) · `en`

Pink is associated with babies, cute and cuddly woollies for girls, soft blankets to tuck around a baby, roses, elephants and gin! It is my favourite colour – inappropriate for me I suppose, given my age and weight, but nonetheless I love it. There is no accounting for taste and so I wear pink whenever possible. I labour under the delusion that it suits me.

Just recently, clad in a pink cotton sari that did nothing for my figure, I sashayed forth to a society luncheon where 5C ladies plus two well-known men about town (Master chef and Fashion guru, Koluu and Kirthi) chattered happily and generally had a wonderful time. The sari belonged to granddaughter KitKat, who does not wear it because she considers it, ‘A little schoolgirlish.’

“Certainly. I wasn’t planning on just transferring it from your cupboard to mine.”

KitKat has learnt tact – but not with her near and dear. “Won’t it puff out a little?”

At the lunch, ladies got into the act. “You look like a pink rose,” said one.
