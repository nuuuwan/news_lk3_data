    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has met International Monetary Fund quantitative targets for June 2023 except state revenues, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "The IMF program has a set of quantitative targets listed as \u2018performance criteria\u2019 which has to be mandatorily or seek a waiver and also indicative targets. The central government tax revenue floor of 1,300 billion rupees is an indicative target.",
    "\u201cAll the targets have been met, except the revenue target is below,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe told reporters.",
    "\u201cThe import duties envisaged were much lower due to lower imports. That is why we have recommended to the government to relax import restrictions.\u201d",
    "According to data already in the public domain, government tax revenues up to April was 742 billion rupees.",
    "The performance criteria on the fiscal targets is the primary deficit of 113 billion rupees not the revenue target. By April the primary deficit was only 5.29 billion rupees.",
    "After June Sri Lanka has since hiked taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.",
    "The IMF program had an inflation target of 31 percent measured by the Colombo Consumers Price Index. The actual was 12 percent.",
    "The central bank was expected to bring down its net international reserves, which were a negative 3540 billion rupees by end December 2022 to 2830 million dollars (a 740 million dollar improvement) by June.",
    "\u201cWe have already met the target,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said. \u201cWhatever the opportunity, we would like to build positions.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s gross reserves have now reached 3.5 billion dollars, Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "The central bank\u2019s net reserves are negative due to borrowing dollars and spending them to finance imports and other outflows and offsetting the interventions with printed money to keep policy rates down artificially.",
    "Gross official reserves, not counting central bank borrowings, are up about 1.6 billion US dollars from December to June.",
    "As interest rates fall, and credit recovers, the ability to collect reserves reduces. Analysts have warned that IMF programs usually fail in the second year, currencies depreciate due to rates being cut as inflation falls.",
    "The falling currency then triggers public discontent, the electorate loses faith in reforms and reformist governments are overturned.",
    "Western central banks started to create balance of payments deficits in the 1920s and 1930s after the US in particular developed the fixed policy rate in the course of triggering the roaring 20s bubble and the Great Depression.",
    "Western Mercantilists then started to blame the \u2018commercial balance\u2019 (now called the trade deficit) and later the current account deficit, and not the fixed policy rate for external troubles.",
    "Analysts have warned that the reserve target and monetary policy consultation clause is at fundamental conflict and is against the laws of nature explained by classical economists (generally also described in the so-called impossible trinity of monetary policy objectives).",
    "READ MORE Sri Lanka can cut rates now, keeping them down as credit picks up will hit rupee",
    "The central bank has only created about 1.5 percent inflation from September 2022 to June 2023, partly helped by currency appreciation from 360 to around 320 to the US dollar.",
    "When rates are cut, and enforced with open market operations (reserve money is inflated), BOP deficits emerge before inflation shows up in indices leading to exchange rate volatility.",
    "Countries with such central banks keep going to the IMF again and again.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s import and exchange controls are also a consequence of mis-targeted interest rates through various liquidity tools in the past.",
    "Other indicative targets include not guaranteeing more state enterprise debt, not running SOE losses. (Colombo/July07/2023)"
