    "US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has stated that the United States shares the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) with regards to the ongoing antidrug operation \u2018Yukthiya\u2019.",
    "While acknowledging that combatting drug trafficking is essential, Ambassador Chung noted that it remains crucial that law enforcement operations uphold the principles of the rule of law and its due process.",
    "\u201cStriking that balance is vital for justice and maintaining public trust\u201d, she said in this regard.",
    "On 08 January, the HRCSL released a statement on Operation \u2018Yukthiya\u2019, raising concerns that the operation has become associated with reports of widespread injustice, making its very title \u2018Yukthiya\u2019 (meaning \u2018justice), a \u201cmisnomer\u201d.",
    "They further highlighted that every Sri Lankan reserves the right to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as per Article 11 of the Constitution, and emphasised that this right, along with several others including the right to life, freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention and the right to not be deprived of liberty except on the order of a judge, as per provisions of the Constitution, remain absolute and inalienable, and may not be restricted under any circumstances.",
    "\u201cThe primary challenge in terms of justice in Sri Lanka today is its culture of impunity, exemplified by the lack of accountability of law enforcement officers for torture, custodial and encounter deaths, and arbitrary arrests and detention, despite findings of responsibility by the country\u2019s apex court\u201d, the HRCSL state, and thereby urged the Ministry of Public Security, the President and the Government of Sri Lanka to \u201cpay more attention to the current approach to law enforcement and focus instead on meaningfully reforming law enforcement institutions\u201d.",
    "Earlier, on 06 January, the BASL raised alarms about what it deemed a rise in arbitrary arrests and criminal activity.",
    "The BASL also underscored the utmost significance of adhering to due process and upholding the rule of law.",
    "The association deemed police raids, including the demolition of property carried out without valid search warrants and/or valid search orders, whilst flagrantly violating established legal protocols, render them unlawful.",
    "It noted that such unwarranted actions not only undermine the bedrock principles of justice but also erode public confidence in the integrity of law enforcement agencies.",
    "Attached below is the full statement issued by both, the HRCSL and BASL:"
