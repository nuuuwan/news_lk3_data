    "Claims SJB is most aligned with SLFP policies and ideologies as envisioned by party founder",
    "Urges citizens to examine SJB\u2019s proposals and compare it with those of other parties",
    "Affirms SJB\u2019s readiness to address issues faced by country\u2019s citizens",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Chandima Weerakkody on Tuesday declared that the SJB is the most suitable political party for members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).",
    "The MP addressing a press conference highlighted that SLFP founder S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike aimed to steer the party towards a moderate stance. Drawing parallels, he suggested that the SJB is currently following a similar path. Consequently, he maintained that the ideology most aligned with SLFP members is represented by the SJB.",
    "Former SLFPer Weerakkody expressed his belief that the SLFP has undergone significant deterioration. He proposed that SLFP members might find it advantageous to consider joining the SJB, as its policies and ideology align more closely with their own.",
    "While acknowledging that the rival Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has gained some votes, he cautioned against basing politics solely on crowd support. Emphasising the importance of scrutinising politicians and understanding their proposed programs, he stressed the need to empower a political party capable of offering solutions to the country\u2019s challenges.",
    "He urged citizens to examine the proposals put forward by the SJB and compare them with those of other parties, advocating for voting in favour of a party that offers viable solutions. \u201cWhen people make decisions in this manner, a brighter future awaits the country,\u201d he asserted. He affirmed the SJB\u2019s readiness to address the issues faced by the\u00a0people.",
    "Weerakkody criticised the current President and Government, accusing them of failing to fulfil their promises to the people and instead prioritising the interests of a select few. He said their actions are leading the country towards a downward spiral and endangering the democratic rights of the people. \u201cThe people anticipate a change,\u201d he remarked."
