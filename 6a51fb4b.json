  "original_body_lines": [
    "Thai Ambassador to Sri Lanka Poj Harnpol said the mission of transfer of tusker Muthu Raja to Thailand would not have been made possible without the concerted efforts from both Sri Lankan and Thai Governments at all levels, and therefore, this joint operation even cemented \u2018unique and time-tested\u2019 ties between the two countries.\u00a0 \u00a0The ambassador was responding to a query about reports that the issue involving the tusker affected bilateral ties.",
    "He said, \u201cIn carrying out this project together, we have been able to identify areas of future cooperation for the mutual benefits of our two countries. It\u2019s worth noted that one of the Sri Lankan mahouts accompanied Muthu Raja to Thailand.\u00a0 This proves that the transfer of knowledge has already begun.",
    "Asked whether the tusker would be returned to Sri Lanka after treatment, he said, in principle, the transfer of Muthu Raja back will be carried out after complete and successful treatment with his rehabilitation to full recovery.",
    "\u201cAt this juncture, let\u2019s focus on the tusker\u2019s wellbeing and let\u2019s cherish the fact that this mission has brought about greater awareness on animal rights and caring of them,\u201d he said. (Kelum Bandara)"
