    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Western Province has reported the highest number of school children addicted to narcotics, according to the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB).\u00a0The alarming trend has prompted renewed calls for early intervention and stronger community support systems.Data from the NDDCB reveals that children between the ages of 12 and 17 who experiment with drugs for the first time have a 67% likelihood of repeated use.Speaking on the issue, Maheshi Madhuwanthi, a senior official at the NDDCB, emphasized that addiction is not an immediate outcome but the final stage of a four-phase process. She warned against prematurely labeling children as addicts and advocated for a more empathetic and informed approach.\u201cSome children are even expelled from school after a single incident. But addiction is the last stage. These children are often in the early stages of experimentation, driven by curiosity or peer influence,\u201d she said.Madhuwanthi highlighted the psychological state of these children, describing it as \u201cego-centric thinking\u201d\u2014a phase where adolescents are more likely to take risks and challenge boundaries. She stressed that adults must take responsibility for guiding them through this vulnerable period.\u201cThe World Health Organization states that if a child between 12 and 17 tries drugs once, there\u2019s a 67% chance they\u2019ll do it again. That\u2019s why managing adolescence requires adult cooperation. We can\u2019t place the burden solely on the child,\u201d she added.She also pointed out that many students are reluctant to open up about their struggles due to fear of judgment or mistreatment by school authorities. In some cases, teachers themselves may unintentionally contribute to the child\u2019s emotional distress.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen cases where students don\u2019t speak up because they fear being mentally or emotionally mistreated. These children are not addicts\u2014they are in a phase of experimentation. They need support, not punishment,\u201d she said.The NDDCB continues to conduct school-based awareness programs, but officials stress that a collaborative effort involving parents, teachers, and mental health professionals is essential to address the root causes of youth drug use."
