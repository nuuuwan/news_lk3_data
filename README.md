The United Socialist Party supports the Tamil community's right to self-determination in Sri Lanka's North and East, differing from other parties' stances. They argue against using the 13th Amendment as a vote-grabbing tactic among minorities. Despite potential national disagreement, they believe in fairness and oppose the notion that granting self-determination would lead to division, citing past political shifts as evidence.

🟩

The United Socialist Party's presidential candidate Sinhangjayasuriya has said that the party has never stumbled on the issue of the Tamil community in the North and East.

The 13th Amendment is used as a tool to get votes from minorities during elections.

However, we belong to the United Socialist Party.

We firmly believe that the Tamil community in the North East has the right to self -determination.

Our position may not be supported in some parts of the country, but we think this is fair.

We do not think that the people of the North East are more interested in implementing the current 13 -year -old.

We do not think that giving the Tamils ​​the right to self -determination will divide the country.

For example, the JVP once strongly opposed the 13th Amendment and used violence against it.

But they have changed their position.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s John Keells Holdings has teamed up with Nepal’s Chaudhary Group, to sell electric vehicles made by China’s BYD, banking on a shift from internal combustion engines.

“We saw electric vehicles had a very promising future,” Balendra said. ” We think there will be a lot of people who will switch from petrol to election vehicles.”

“Sri Lankans are more likely to think the country is headed in the wrong direction than people in any other country where this is polled.

With only 8% of citizens thinking that the country is going in the right direction and 72% thinking it is “on the wrong track”, it would be borderline lunacy to assume that Ranil, ably supported by the most detested parliamentarians since 1970-77, could get into double-digits in September. “…Public views towards the country’s direction have worsened since July 2023, driven by a steady decline in uncommitted respondents.” (Ibid)
