    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s new government led by ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) is in discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the restructuring of state owned enterprises (SOE) and it will not opt for privatization as the first option, Cabinet Spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.",
    "Soon after the election of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, his interim government said it would not privatize state-owned national carrier SriLankan Airlines. Later, it said a decision would be taken after the November 14 parliamentary election.",
    "It is not clear what will be done with SriLankan which also has a defaulted bond and other loans. The last administration was also planning the privatize several state ventures which were hit by procedural delays.",
    "\u201cThe last government appointed a committee to look into restructuring which was only meant for selling the assets,\u201d Jayatissa, also the Minister of Mass Media and Health told reporters on Tuesday (31) at the weekly post-cabinet media briefing.",
    "\u201cThey were planning to sell by divesting from the government. Our government policy is different",
    "\u201cWe have handed over these institutions to ministries to assess them and see how best we can use them to the country\u2019s development,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t consider institution wise, we see where Sri Lanka Telecom stands in the country\u2019s economy in the future, where SriLankan Airlines stands in the country\u2019s tourism and economy. We consider all the institutions in that way. So, we are trying to manage these institutions with that vision.\u201d",
    "The SOE restructuring is considered as important as debt restructuring, because most of the state institutions run by the government had been mismanaged and running at a loss with the tax payers had to bear the losses.",
    "The previous government led by Ranil Wickremsinghe called bids for state-owned Hotel Developers Lanka Ltd, Canwill Holdings Pvt Ltd, Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, Litro Gas Lanka Limited, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Ltd, and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Ltd.",
    "Cabinet spokesman said privatization will only be the second step, if the current move with regard to SOE fails.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s see how we can make these institutions productive without corruption in the government and institutions. Our first effort is to keep these institutions under the government and make them contribute to the country\u2019s development. If that effort fails only we will have to consider the second step.\u201d",
    "The impact of state enterprises on public finances as well as state banks has been an issue that the IMF program has tried to address as particularly the debt of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Sri Lankan figured in the default restructuring.",
    "\u201cWe are discussing with the IMF. Some of the concessions are being given while discussing with the IMF and within the existing (IMF) framework. IMF also has not put forward rigid conditions that can\u2019t be changed,\u201d Jayatissa said when asked if there is a pressure from the IMF for restructuring.",
    "\u201cIf they (IMF) have the confidence on the country\u2019s spending and revenue, we can change certain things. In fact we are considering how important these conditions and these institutions are for our country and benefits for people.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe IMF is on one side and the government is on the other side. We are discussing with the IMF aiming on the country\u2019s goal with the people\u2019s aspirations. They have been continuing the disbursement while we are explaining them the issues from the public point of view. We are carrying forward the discussion in a way it will give least pressure to the public.\u201d (Colombo/January 1/2025 \u2013 Update II)"
