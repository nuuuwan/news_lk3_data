    "He possesses a captivating intellect and spending even a few minutes with him feels like an extraordinary privilege. He, who identified himself as an \u201caccidental diplomat,\u201d was Singapore\u2019s Ambassador to the UN and then served as the President of the United Nations Security Council. Kishore Mahbubani, an esteemed scholar, diplomat, and author, is well-known for his incisive analyses of global geopolitics and economic development.",
    "In his book The Asian 21st Century, Mahbubani presents a compelling argument for the centrality of Asia in shaping the global order of the future. He contends that the 21st century will not only be an Asian century but one where the lessons from Asian societies can provide critical insights into tackling global challenges. In this book, he emphasises that \u201cthe Asian way of thinking, characterised by pragmatism and a deep respect for the complexities of history, can offer solutions to the multifaceted problems facing humanity.\u201d",
    "Mahbubani\u2019s intellectual journey is deeply rooted in his childhood and family background. Growing up in Singapore during the tumultuous period of the 1960s, he witnessed first-hand the struggles and aspirations of a newly independent nation. His mother, a homemaker who valued education immensely, instilled in him a profound respect for learning and critical thinking. In his writings, he often reflects on how her influence shaped his world-view, stating, \u201cMy mother taught me that education was the most powerful tool for change.\u201d This belief in the transformative power of education has guided his career, fuelling his desire to elevate the discourse around development and governance.",
    "As a child, Mahbubani was surrounded by Singapore\u2019s vibrant multicultural society, which further enriched his understanding of the world. He often speaks of the harmony that characterised his upbringing, noting how different cultures coexisted peacefully. This multicultural backdrop laid the foundation for his later work in diplomacy, where he championed dialogue and mutual understanding among nations. His formative experiences have driven his belief that societies thrive when they embrace diversity and foster collaboration.",
    "Last week, I sat down with Professor Kishore Mahbubani to discuss some of the emerging issues in Asia. He offered a deep analysis of the key factors driving Singapore\u2019s economic success, contrasting it sharply with the challenges faced by other small nations like Sri Lanka. His insights not only shed light on Singapore\u2019s remarkable achievements but also outline potential strategies for other countries striving to replicate its success.",
    "He began by addressing the initial scepticism that surrounded Singapore\u2019s future at the time of its independence in 1965. The founding leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee, believed they faced insurmountable challenges. Remarkably, they envied Sri Lanka, viewing it as a peaceful and prosperous nation. \u201cThey thought Sri Lanka was peaceful and prosperous, and their dream was to become like Sri Lanka,\u201d Mahbubani recalled. However, history unfolded differently, and Singapore emerged as a global powerhouse while Sri Lanka faced economic difficulties.",
    "Mahbubani\u2019s analysis reveals a critical turning point: \u201cSri Lanka could easily have been as successful as Singapore, if not more successful, if it had followed the same secret formula of Singapore\u2019s success.\u201d He articulated this formula succinctly as the MPH formula, emphasising three core tenets: meritocracy, pragmatism, and honesty.",
    "Meritocracy, according to Mahbubani, involves selecting individuals for leadership roles based solely on their abilities rather than their ethnic backgrounds. \u201cWe just pick the best candidate,\u201d he asserted, pointing out that even though Singapore\u2019s population is predominantly Chinese, leaders like S. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan Tamil, were chosen based on their competence. This commitment to meritocracy is starkly contrasted with practises in many countries where nepotism and favouritism often dominate. Mahbubani\u2019s assertion that \u201cmeritocracy is the first reason for Singapore\u2019s success\u201d resonates deeply with the ethos of governance in the city-state.",
    "The second component of the MPH formula, pragmatism, highlights Singapore\u2019s approach to problem-solving. Mahbubani recounted the wisdom of Dr. Goh Keng Swee, who advised, \u201cNo matter what problem Singapore encounters, somebody somewhere has encountered the same problem.\u201d This perspective encouraged Singaporean leaders to learn from the experiences of other nations, particularly Japan, which had successfully modernised by adopting best practises from various countries. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that other countries like Sri Lanka or others have not copied Singapore,\u201d he noted, stressing the ease of learning from successful models rather than reinventing the wheel.",
    "The final element of the MPH formula, honesty, is the most challenging to maintain. Mahbubani highlighted Singapore\u2019s achievement of \u201cnear zero corruption,\u201d underscoring that while no society is entirely free from corruption, Singapore has come remarkably close. \u201cThere\u2019s always some degree of corruption, but Singapore has achieved near zero,\u201d he affirmed. This commitment to integrity is critical in fostering trust and stability, essential ingredients for economic growth. He further elaborated, stating, \u201cIn a society where trust is maintained, the economy can thrive.\u201d",
    "As the conversation shifted toward Singapore\u2019s democratic processes, Mahbubani addressed the often-cited criticisms regarding the political landscape. He asserted, \u201cIn Singapore, no one questions the fact that every five years, the people of Singapore go for elections.\u201d He emphasised that the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) remains in power through democratic means, receiving support from a significant majority of the electorate. \u201cThe PAP is in power not because of dictatorial means,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut because the people of Singapore have voted for the government to stay.\u201d This statement challenges the narrative that Singapore\u2019s success is solely a product of autocratic governance.",
    "Mahbubani elaborated on the notion of accountability in governance. He believes that good governance is inherently tied to the effectiveness of public administration, stating, \u201cEffective governance is like a fine-tuned engine; it requires constant attention and maintenance.\u201d This perspective underlines the importance of responsiveness in leadership, a critical factor that enables Singapore to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing global environment.",
    "The discussion then turned to the broader geopolitical landscape, particularly concerning China\u2019s rise as a global power. Mahbubani noted the complexities that smaller nations face in this context. \u201cAs China is rising, the United States has decided that the rise of China is a challenge to the United States,\u201d he remarked. This has led to a significant geopolitical contest, where nations must navigate their relationships with both China and the United States. Mahbubani emphasised that ASEAN countries have been clear in their desire not to take sides in this rivalry, aiming instead for amicable relations with both superpowers.",
    "He further elaborated on the implications of this geopolitical tension. \u201cIt is important for all Asian states, like the ASEAN states, like Sri Lanka, to speak out and say that we want to be friends with both,\u201d he advised, underscoring the need for diplomatic agility in a rapidly changing world. Mahbubani\u2019s approach highlights the necessity of balancing relationships in a multipolar world, where power dynamics are continuously shifting.",
    "As the conversation deepened, Mahbubani reflected on the commentary made by Amerian geopolitical analysts like George Friedman regarding China\u2019s increasing military might. \u201cThe question Friedman should ask is why is the United States spending more on defence than the next ten countries combined?\u201d he said, highlighting the disproportionate military expenditures of the U.S. compared to China\u2019s relatively modest investments. He pointed out that while China\u2019s defence spending has increased, it remains consistent as a percentage of its GDP, a nuance often overlooked in discussions of military power.",
    "In addressing the U.S.\u2019s global military presence, Mahbubani contended, \u201cThe United States is the only major developed country where the average income of the bottom 50% has gone down.\u201d He argued that the U.S. should reallocate its resources from maintaining a vast military presence worldwide to improving the welfare of its own citizens. \u201cInstead of spending money to protect its primacy in the global system,\u201d he suggested, \u201cit should spend its money to help its own people.\u201d",
    "The dialogue then shifted toward the concept of an ASEAN-NATO alliance, which Mahbubani approached with scepticism. He criticised the notion as lacking understanding of Asia\u2019s unique geopolitical context. \u201cThe Europeans have become geopolitically incompetent,\u201d he stated, noting the EU\u2019s struggles compared to ASEAN\u2019s stability and growth.",
    "Mahbubani argued that instead of lecturing Asian countries, Europeans should learn from the successes of the ASEAN model. He pointed out, \u201cThe tragedy about the Europeans is that they don\u2019t seem to understand that instead of lecturing the rest of the world, they should learn from the rest of the world.\u201d This call for humility in international relations reflects Mahbubani\u2019s broader advocacy for a multipolar world where diverse perspectives are respected and valued.",
    "In this context, he articulated a broader vision for regional cooperation. \u201cThe future of regional security lies in collaboration, not confrontation,\u201d he asserted.",
    "In these tumultuous times, Mahbubani\u2019s work urges us to embrace the complexities of our world with a spirit of collaboration and understanding. It is a call to action for leaders and citizens alike to recognise that the future of our interconnected globe hinges on our ability to learn from one another and work together toward a common purpose. As Mahbubani eloquently put it, \u201cThe path to progress lies not only in recognising the unique challenges faced by each nation but also in fostering a spirit of collaboration that transcends borders.\u201d This vision, rooted in a deep respect for humanity and the shared challenges we face, remains a guiding light in the pursuit of a better future for all.",
