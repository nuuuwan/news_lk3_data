    "A top source based in Islamabad said drugs smuggled in Iranian dhows to the international waters close to Sri Lanka are smuggled into the country using fishing trawl boats registered under local names.",
    "\u201cIt is then challenging for the local authorities to keep a tab on drug traffickers,\u201d the source said .",
    "Also, another source close to the UN said the Sri Lankan investigative authorities should be trained further in evidence gathering to facilitate litigation that can lead to conviction of suspects.",
