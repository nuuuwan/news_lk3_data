    "The Indo-Lanka Chamber of Commerce & Industry (ILCCI) affiliated to The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce successfully hosted an interactive webinar aimed at equipping Sri Lankan business leaders with a deeper understanding of India\u2019s evolving policy environment, economic priorities, and emerging strategic growth sectors. The session was presented by the Edelman Group and supported by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI).",
    "Led by Edelman\u2019s Public & Government Affairs practice, the program explored how Sri Lankan enterprises can align with India\u2019s growth trajectory for long-term value creation. The comprehensive discussion covered diverse topics, from identifying sectoral opportunities in various Indian states to outlining the essential steps required to enter and thrive in the Indian market.",
    "ILCCI Vice President Krishna Selvanathan opened the session by noting that Sri Lanka is in a region, already among the world\u2019s largest economies, which is poised to reach the $ 10 trillion mark in the medium term. He stressed that India possesses significant untapped potential across many sectors and one such example is tourism, where Sri Lanka attracts only about half a million tourists out of 2 billion domestic tourists in India He further emphasised that success in doing business in India will depend on a well-defined strategy and a degree of localisation as each state has its own vibrant culture and is a huge economy in its own right. The highly interactive format enabled participants to gain practical, actionable insights.",
    "FICCI encouraged Sri Lankan companies to move beyond traditional approaches by exploring more states, diversifying into new sectors, and pursuing innovative ideas. They also shared candid lessons drawn from the missteps of foreign entrants into India, offering valuable guidance on avoiding common pitfalls, and assured their full support to Sri Lankan businesses seeking assistance in navigating the Indian market.",
    "The webinar served as an invaluable platform for fostering cross-border understanding and inspiring new avenues of collaboration between Sri Lanka and India\u2019s vibrant economic landscape."
