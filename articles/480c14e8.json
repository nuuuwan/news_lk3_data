    "This Government and this President have the best opportunity in decades to truly unify the country like none other \u2013 Pic by Shehan Gunasekara",
    "How with the overwhelming mandate from the people of the north and the east, the NPP has a unique opportunity to unite the country",
    "The Rajapaksa family was duly credited with uniting the country after winning a relentless war with the LTTE. In May 2009 the war was won and the country was declared united as one.",
    "But for years afterwards, racism continued to feature in political campaigns and while the peace was won, question marks persisted regarding the hearts and minds of the northerner. And doubts remained regarding their actual integration with their southern brethren.",
    "2024 may be seen as a watershed moment in Sri Lankan history as a Presidential election was fought where racism was not an issue. Language and religion did not play a role and none of the candidates had a divisive agenda.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) won the election with ease. His NPP mobilised voters who were disenchanted by the existing political establishment and angry at the mismanagement of the economy that led to the economic crisis (weeks without fuel and electricity) and distraught at the subsequent IMF driven austerity measures and high inflation that has brought untold sufferings on the people.",
    "Though the Presidential election bought a hitherto unknown (to the seat of power) AKD to the helm, the voters continued to be divided along regional lines \u2013 the north and east voted green (Sajith/Ranil) while the rest voted for AKD.",
    "His non-racist approach and messages of reconciliation seem to have worked",
    "In declaring a Parliamentary election to consolidate his ability to foster change, AKD made an appeal to the people to give him a mandate as one \u2013 and not across previously determined voting lines. His non-racist approach in the Presidential elections and messages of reconciliation seem to have worked. Combined with the fracturing of the Tamil parties it has resulted in NPP candidates winning big in the north. Possibly for the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s proportional electoral system that a national party (based in the south) has conclusively won a mandate from the people of the north.",
    "In Jaffna electoral district the NPP won 24.85% votes and three seats making it the leading party in the district. In Vanni, the NPP won 20.37% of all votes and won two seats making it the leading party here too. In Trincomalee the NPP won 42.48% of votes and won two seats making, again leading the race among all other parties.",
    "It seems like the NPP is the leading party in all districts of the north and east other than Batticaloa. Which means the Tamil people have placed their faith and trust to redeem their future on a party from the south.",
    "The significance of this cannot be understated. It could mean that the people of the north share the island-wide sentiment for political change. And more significantly are placing their trust on a national mainstream party with AKD at the helm to deliver that change for them.",
    "Of course it can never be denied that the role of the Rajapaksa Government in ending the war has paved the way for unity and for this day when the ballot can cement the unity.",
    "Now the true work has to begin. How will AKD and his team go about the task of fulfilling not only the aspirations of the people of the island but specifically of the people of the north and east? Will their grievances related to land ownership and disappearances be addressed? The longstanding issue of fishermen related to encroachments from across the maritime border will also be on the table.",
    "This Government and this President have the best opportunity in decades to truly unify the country like none other. How he and his ministers go about doing this will define the future of this pearl in the Indian Ocean. If a sincere approach is forthcoming, it would be a beacon of hope for the people of the north and east.",
    "Let\u2019s hope these amazing results will truly herald a new political culture as promised. And an equally golden time for all its citizens irrespective of geography or past history.",
