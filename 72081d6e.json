    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has no intention of defeating President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s budget for 2024, according to SLPP leader and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Speaking to reporters in Kandy on Wednesday November 15 after a religious ceremony at the Temple of the Tooth, Rajapaksa intimated that, while the budget may have a few minor shortcomings, it was generally positive.",
    "\u201cYes. When we\u2019re together, with a few minor shortcomings, there is a journey we\u2019re embarked on together,\u201d he said in a somewhat garbled and hurried response to a direct question by a reporter on whether he thought the budget was good.",
    "Rajapaksa was ostensibly referring to the continuation of his party\u2019s ongoing alliance with President Wickremesinghe, though speculation continues to be strife that all is not well.",
    "Rajapaksa\u2019s son and SLPP legislator Namal Rajapaksa, contrary to his party leader, sounded rather sceptical of Wickremesnghe\u2019s ambitions for turning the crisis-hit economy around through the 2024 budget.",
    "\u201cWe must study the budget. He had presented a lot of these proposals in last year\u2019s budget too. They don\u2019t seem to have been implemented,\u201d Namal Rajapaksa said, speaking to reporters after the budget presentation Monday November 13 afternoon.",

    "According to Rajapaksa senior, however, the SLPP has no intention of defeating the budget, which would result in a dissolution of parliament followed by an election.",
    "\u201cNo, there is no reason to defeat the budget. None of our people intend to do that now,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked to comment on his son\u2019s remarks on the budget, the former president said: \u201cAsk him about that.\u201d",
    "The SLPP leader also said his party ready for an election \u201canytime\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe have planned to hold the party convention in a grand scale. We intend to bring every member from every district,\u201d said Rajapaksa, adding that his brother and SLPP architect Basil Rajapaksa is currently organising the convention. (Colombo/Nov16/2023)"
