    "Full day hands on workshop benefits 100 farmers in Kilinochchi",
    "The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has partnered with the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Jaffna to deliver hands-on training in smart farming technologies to 100 farmers in Kilinochchi in a significant move to modernise Sri Lanka\u2019s agriculture and strengthen food security in the face of climate change.",
    "A full-day workshop was held at the University\u2019s greenhouses and demonstration fields under the banner of the Bank\u2019s \u2018Agri Modernisation Village\u2019 program. It brought together farmers, youth, agriculture students, and instructors to explore practical, environmentally sustainable methods that address the challenges posed by erratic weather patterns, pest outbreaks, and reduced crop yields.",
    "Participants engaged directly with climate-smart innovations including compost choppers, drought-resistant crop varieties, efficient irrigation systems, and renewable energy-powered tools. The workshop placed special emphasis on youth empowerment, aiming to cultivate a new generation of agri-entrepreneurs equipped with both the mindset and the means to transform farming into a modern, technology-driven, and profitable enterprise.",
    "The training was coordinated by the University\u2019s Outreach Committee, which facilitated the knowledge transfer using its automated greenhouses, farm units, and farmer-maintained demonstration fields in Kilinochchi. Commercial Bank supported the initiative financially and facilitated the participation of its agricultural loan customers, ensuring that farmers could gain exposure to technologies that may be adopted with the help of tailored financial solutions from the Bank.",
    "This latest intervention builds on the Bank\u2019s growing footprint in agri-modernisation and reflects its broader commitment to sustainable development, rural economic upliftment, and environmental stewardship. Through such initiatives, the Bank said it aims not only to enhance the productivity and resilience of its farmer clients but also to reduce credit risk and promote long-term economic stability across Sri Lanka\u2019s agricultural communities.",
    "What sets this program apart is its practical field-based learning, strong collaboration between academia, the financial sector, and grassroots farmers, and its strategic alignment with national climate adaptation goals. The workshop forms part of an evolving model that links hands-on knowledge, real-world technology, and financial accessibility \u2013 all essential ingredients for revitalising rural agriculture.",
    "This effort is also embedded in a larger vision of Commercial Bank: to create Agri Modernisation Villages across the country that showcase replicable models of sustainable farming. Through training, demonstrations, and partnerships with universities, the Bank said it envisions a nationwide transformation of agriculture that will help address food insecurity, rising costs, and declining farmer incomes.",
    "Commercial Bank\u2019s involvement ensures that participants not only receive cutting-edge technical guidance but are also supported to make informed investments in the tools and methods they experience first-hand. The program is especially focused on bringing young people into the fold, positioning farming as a career of opportunity and innovation rather than one of hardship and uncertainty, the Bank said.",
    "This program in Kilinochchi follows similar recent interventions in Batticaloa and Welimada and strengthens Commercial Bank\u2019s position as the only private bank in Sri Lanka actively leading agricultural transformation through public\u2013private\u2013academic partnerships."
