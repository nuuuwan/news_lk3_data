    "Innumerable essays were written during schooldays; celebrated in 1948 was Major Desamanya Duncan M White\u2019s Olympic silver medal in the 400m hurdles in London; and even more so Susanthika Jayasinghe\u2019s bronze promoted to silver in the 200m sprint in 2000 in Sydney. Thus no surprise that interest runs high every four years when the Summer Olympic Games are held. After all, here is one event that draws the world together in holding the most attended and famed gathering of all, a sporting event aimed to be sans politics, enmity, corrosive competition. Rather is it meant to foster a coming together of all nations of the world in peace, inducing sportsmanship of the correct win or lose type; with no monetary awards given by IOC, the International Olympics Committee.",
    "in Paris is the 33rd in the new series of Olympiads and will be held from July 27 to August 5. The most remarkable coincidence, or planned conjunction when bidding took place eight years ago to host the Olympics in Paris, is that this year\u2019s Games are a centenary celebration. France was host in 1900 and 1924. It now equals Britain\u2019s record of hosting three Olympic Games in England: 1908, 1948 and 2012.",
    "The motto of the current Games in French is  \u2018Ouvrons grand le Jeux\u2019 which the 2024 French Olympic Games President, Tony Estanguet, says means \u2018Games wide open\u2019 with 206 nations participating in 329 events in 32 sports. Two new events have been introduced: kiteboarding and kayak crossing while a new sport \u2013 breaking or breakdancing will have athletes face off in solo dance battles. The number of participating athletes is reckoned to be 10,714. For the first time in the history of the Games, numerical gender parity would be achieved with the number of women increasing to equal that of men athletes this year.",
    "For its mascot the French have moved away from the usual choice of an animal started in 1972 when the Munich Games had a rainbow hued dachshund. This year the mascot is a hat; not any ole hat but a Phrygian cap dating back to the 18th century when it was a symbol of freedom during the French revolution. This cap traces its ancestry to a Greek village \u2013 Phrygia 1200 BC, which featured in the Trojan War and the legend of Midas.",
    "The opening ceremony will be along the River Seine which underwent a preparatory ten year cleaning process costing much. Thus while earlier, swimming was forbidden and no fish lived due to the poisonous nature of the river water, swimming events will be held in the Seine.",
    "Everyone, even little children, know that the Olympic Games or Olympiads originated in Olympia in ancient Greece. They were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city states and were in honour of Zeus. Aristotle dated the first as of 776 BC. They continued after Rome invaded and subjugated Greece from 86 BC. Roman General Sulla sacked Olympia but Augustus Caesar (63BC -14AD) revived the Games. Emperor Nero continued his fiddling even while overlooking the Roman Empire in Greece and introduced song and music to the Olympic competitions. The Games died a slow death and finally ceased in 393 AD, perhaps consequential to a fire that burned down the temple of the Olympian Zeus.",
    "Also known by all is that only men participated in the games and women were not allowed even as spectators. However women crept in as winners in the chariot races when they were owners of winning chariots. The award to winners were wreaths or crowns of ivy leaves; but they earned fame in their city states and had statues built in their honour; maybe money was gifted too. Another fact is that runners, discus throwers and other athletes competed naked in the sports arena.",
    "It came to pass that Charles Pierre de Fredy, Baron de Coubertin a.k.a. Pierre de Coubertin, a French aristocrat, educator, promoter of schools sports and historian, while graduating from the Institut d\u2019etudes politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) aimed at resurrecting the Olympic Games. He co-founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) with Greek Evangelos Zappas; became its second president and restarted the holding of the four yearly Games. In his name is given a medal to athletes by the IOC who demonstrate the spirit of sportsmanship.",
    "It was Coubertin who designed the Olympic symbol of five interlocking rings of equal dimension, coloured most often; from the left \u2013 blue, yellow, black, green and red with the yellow and green linked below the others. The rings represent the five continents; unparalleled symbol recognize worldwide by 93% of its people and having the \u2018power to mobilize, catalyze and inspire\u2019. Also by Coubertin was the motto worded: \u2018Citius, Altius, Fortius \u2013 Communiter\u2019 which translates to \u2018Faster, Higher, Stronger \u2013 Together\u2019.",
    "The first re-invented Games were held in 1896 in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens, organized mostly by co-founder Evamgelos Zappa\u2019s cousin Konstantinos Zappas. Fourteen nations took part sending 241 athletes to compete in 43 events. It then continued being held every four years, increasing in every aspect.",
    "The Olympic Flame that burns through the Games and lights the torch for the next games, and Torch Relay are important binding activities that set the pace for the games, bringing cohesion in the host country and publicity along the way from Athens where the relay starts to the destined place where the Games are to be held.",
    "At the beginning of the Games oaths are sworn to by judges and athletes. They may be changed slightly each time. I quote here the athletes\u2019 oath of the current Games: \u201cWe promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality. Together we stand in solidarity and commit ourselves to sport without doping, without cheating, without any form of discrimination.\u201d",
    "Many a time problems have raised their troubling heads and ideals of the Games distorted. In 2008, the toxic air over Beijing had athletes and others being affected and complaining. In the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro the Zika virus attacked while complaints were lodged regards the inadequacy of facilities provided athletes at the Games in Athens 2004.",
    "More serious was the Atlanta, Georgia, USA Games bombing of 1996 which resulted in two deaths and 112 injuries. The FBI search was much more dramatic, even catastrophic. They suspected Security Guard Richard Jewell who alerted the police of the knapsack lying on the Centennial Olympic Park. It contained a homemade bomb that exploded among spectators. Though grilled mercilessly by the FBI, Jewell maintained his plea of innocence. Five years later, the man who blew up an abortion clinic and gay nightclub, both in Atlanta, and was hiding in the Appalachian Mountains, was apprehended and admitted to placing the bomb at the Games.",
    "Much more serious with international repercussions was the tragedy that occurred in the 1972 Munich Olympics when eight members of the Palestinian terror group Black September broke in to the Israeli team\u2019s residence and killed one coach and one weightlifting team member who resisted them; and carried away hostages. This was on September 5. Reading about it, one realizes the Munich police were ill prepared, the army was not called in. After 20 hours of tension and horror, at the airport while the terrorists were transferring the captives to whisk them away, exchange of gunfire had 11 Israelis, 5 terrorists and a policeman killed. Three terrorists were captured. Though the Games had continued, for the first time they were suspended for one day in tribute to the dead Israeli athletes.",
    "This year saw protests by Palestine sympathizers against Israeli bombing of Gaza and the massive destruction of human lives and territory. One considers the heavy responsibility of security personal in Paris as of now.",
    "Who\u2019s representing our island? Internet gave me names of three athletes scheduled to be in Paris. They are 800m runner Tharushi Karunaratne, javelin thrower Dilhani Lekamge and 400m runner Aruna Dharshana. One can never be sure of the eventual outcome. We can only hope these three dedicated and hard training young ones are in Paris settled comfortably in the Village. Whether they win medals or not does not matter; they got the chance to compete in the Olympics. I sneak in a comment that may be true: mangers who accompanied them would at least be three to one participant. Less of them going would have meant giving their berths and money spent on them to hopeful athletes, for the exposure to world sports alone. That is not the spirit of sports in SL!",
    "The Games will go on and take place in Los Angeles in 2028. Is India bidding to host the 2032 Summer Games?",
