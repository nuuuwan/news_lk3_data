    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka firms should base their costs and wage on inflation expectations rather than the US dollar, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said amid wide recent fluctuations of the rupee to dollar exchange rate.",
    "The central bank\u2019s anchor is an inflation target of 4 \u2013 5 percent which is achieved by altering interest rates to manage domestic demand and the exchange rate is allowed to move, Governor Weerasinghe, told a forum organized by the Chartered Financial Analysts Society in Sri Lanka.",
    "Firms should therefore not use the US dollar to base wages and costs but inflation expectations, he said.",
    "Though there was a pass-through to inflation from the exchange rate it was not very high based on empirical evidence, he said.",
    "Developed countries that had inflation targets of 2 percent and their exchange rates also moved, he said.",
    "Firms should make greater use of foreign exchange derivatives including swaps and options to manage costs in a flexible exchange rate, Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "The rupee appreciated to 295 from 360 to the US dollar amid negative private credit after a surrender rule was lifted, and fell to 320 and appreciated back to 310 and is now around 327.",
    "However, analysts had warned that a flexible exchange rate is not a clean float but an ad hoc pegging arrangement devised by the IMF used in many countries that defaulted, which violate laws of nature explained by classical economists, which prevented balance of payments deficits until 1920s.",
    "The flexible exchange rate is not a clean float particularly as a there is a foreign reserve target under an International Monetary Program making it impossible to float freely and requires deflationary open market operations to constrain domestic credit and investment.",
    "Attempts to target inflation by cutting rates, when domestic credit recovers tend to trigger a currency collapse even before an IMF program ends, past experience has shown.",
    "In the 2009 IMF program the rupee collapsed from 113 to 131 as rates were cut in 2011 within an IMF program backed by inflationary open market operations.",
    "The rupee also collapsed in 2015/2016 from 131 to 152 as inflationary open market operations were deployed claiming inflation was low (the US had also engaged in quantitative tightening and oil prices fell, and from 152 to 182 under a second IMF program that expired before completion with administration thrown out of office.",
    "Given the past actions of the central bank with the currency collapsing repeatedly under 4-6 percent inflation target, there is very little confidence among the public or research houses or businesses about the currency. (Colombo/July21/2023)"
