Sri Lanka refuses to sign joint letter condemning Israel's UN ban. This goes against the country's history of supporting peace and justice globally. It raises questions about Sri Lanka's stance on international issues and its commitment to diplomacy.

🟩

Mr. Imtiyas Pakir Markar's report on Sri Lanka's decision not to sign a joint letter condemning Israel's ban on UN Secretary -General

Sri Lanka has a long and proud history of supporting multi -faceted, peace and justice in the global arena. Our country continues to support international efforts to resolve conflict and uphold the rights of the oppressed, including our firm support for Palestine in the United Nations.

It is very worrying that Sri Lanka has decided not to sign a joint letter issued by 105 countries, denouncing Israel's ban on entering the country.

The letter, especially in the ongoing Middle East crisis, reiterates the essential role of the United Nations in mediation and humanitarian assistance.. The refusal to join this joint call for justice and peace indicates a significant deviation from our concrete diplomatic traditions.

### My Wedding, my father’s funeral and a portrait of Mr. Bandaranaike

*2024-10-20 01:51:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-wedding-my-fathers-funeral-and-a-portrait-of-mr-bandaranaike/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Render unto Caesar – Memoirs of Bradman Weerakoon)

Two highly personal life-defining events occurred in 1956. One was my marriage in August to Damayanthi and the other the death of my father in late September.

Damayanthi Gunasekera was the third daughter of a friend of my father’s who joined the colonial police at about the same time as Station House Officers. They both served for 35 years before retiring as superintendent in charge of districts. But more than that, Damayanthi’s mother was a Weerakoon from the same village as my father – Payagala in the Kalutara district – and a second or third cousin as well.

Damayanthi’s mother who wed at the age of 14 was said to be a beauty and it was rumoured in family circles that my father. as a young police officer, was seriously interested in her. Be that as it may my parents were really pleased when the proposal from the Gunasekera side came along.

### Real estate deals in the UK including buying a house that once belonged to Margaret Thatcher

(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: A Maverick with a Midas touch, biography of Nahil Wijesuriya)

Nahil and the family moved to London and Nahil decided to continue staying in the UK, living at College Gardens in Dulwich. The children were 10 and 12 years old and the family enjoyed living here.The real estate market in the UK was at an interesting paradigm. The regulations for rates were based on the square footage of a property with the taxable rate being any area above five square feet.

The basement areas under the regulated height were used for storage, considering this space was not taxable. Over the years the rules changed with taxes based on the regions etc. Nahil took advantage of the changes in tax regulations, adding an extra floor by digging into the basement of his property up to foundation level, creating a seven-foot basement which was the regular height and space, equivalent to an extra floor thus adding more value to his property.

As General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH), I led a diverse team of departmental heads. Some had been with the hotel for decades and held traditional views, while others were more adaptable to new trends. Among them was Executive Chef Publis Silva, who had worked at MLH since 1956, starting at the lowest level in the kitchen. Though rooted in tradition, Chef Publis had a flexible, collaborative approach and an unmatched work ethic. Leading his brigade of 80 chefs with distinction, he earned the respect of everyone. When the Chairman of the company, Sanath Ukwatte, decided to reward ‘The Manager of the Year,’ I recommended Chef Publis for the honour. It was awarded to him, with a car as the prize, a testament to his leadership.

### My clash with Philip Gunawardene in the parliament restaurant

*2024-10-20 01:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-clash-with-philip-gunawardene-in-the-parliament-restaurant/) · `en`

In early 1958, I was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Agrarian Services Department, in charge of implementing the Paddy Lands Act of 1958, under the general direction of the Commissioner. As an officer of the CCS I already had some training and experience in law and administration as well as experience in wet and dry zone agriculture and irrigation.

In setting out to draft the Administrative Regulations under the Act, I came across a number of structural, legal and operational considerations, which probably had not been foreseen by its authors – probably because this was the first time it was being looked at by an administrator with field experience.

### Deep State – Sow a Wind and Reap a Whirlwind

*2024-10-20 01:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/deep-state-sow-a-wind-and-reap-a-whirlwind/) · `en`

“If they did prosper and increase in riches, yet they should not long enjoy them themselves, but be pillaged and spoiled of them” Hosea 8:7

The above is quoted from the Bible and is self-explanatory. Since, the concept of Deep State in Sri Lanka is closely connected, to the Easter Bombing, the Bible verse has been referred to due to its significance.

For the first time in Sri Lanka, Deep State has been discussed publicly, by Sunanda Deshapriya, writing about it in his recent book about the Easter Attack. His book is about the fourth publication on the Easter Sunday attack. I have always had great respect for Sunanda as I had been reading his articles from the nineties.

Although I still have not read this book, skimming through it I think it is well researched. He refers to Deep State as ‘Paaraa Rajya’ in Sinhala. Attorney Kishali Pinto Jayawardena too has written about the danger of Deep State in her articles.

### Father and Daughter – unique persons

*2024-10-20 00:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/father-and-daughter-unique-persons/) · `en`

In my last Sunday’s (October 6) article The Reality of the Present and Memories of the Past, I wrote about a young Tamil Australian from western Sydney – S Shakthidharan – whose play Counting and Cracking has been a resounding success in Australia and more recently in New York. I knew who’s who he was but did not wish to mention his family, except for the one fact that he is a great grandson of C Suntheralingam, a colossus of his time. This reticence since I had not got permission from a family member to mention them.

Memories of a grandaunt of the playwright whom I befriended and admired very much kept twirling in my mind. The memories needed exposure through writing. Hence I wrote to her son Architect C Anjalendran for permission to write about her; permission kindly given. I suppose he could not refuse old me though he shies away from publicity. Thus I mean to dedicate this article to my friend Vatha and mention her father, both truly unique persons.

### RUNNING SCARED?

*2024-10-20 00:38:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/running-scared/) · `en`

Never in our recent political history has there been such a simultaneous exodus of political stalwarts, declaring their intent to retire from politics. This is akin to the story of Noah’s Ark, where the threat of imminent disaster, ignited an escape, spurred by a natural existential threat.

Why this sudden realization of the point at which the certainty of age-related decadence, overtakes the myth of the limitless benefit of experience? There has to be something more. Some of these suddenly awakened denizens, may be smelling a so far suppressed and cocooned, visitation by justice as the consequence of moral default and sustained larceny.

### Ex-Presidents  Chandrika,Ranil and Maithripala were responsible for corruption running rampant in the public/political sector when they handled the reins of executive office.

*2024-10-19 20:59:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84933) · `en`

The hideous sight of three former Presidents of Sri Lanka laughing their heads off on the national stage when invited by the country’s accounting professionals to speak on a corruption culture that brought the nation to ruinous bankruptcy in 2022 sums up exactly why the political parties that they lead have been resoundingly rejected by the people.

No more and no less. Certainly there is nothing wrong with a pithy joke or two in addressing an audience. But wholesale cynical cackling by the ex-Presidents (Wickremesinghe, Kumaratunga and Sirisena) in addressing the 45th National Conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) on the viciously entrenched corruption-cancer of the body politic is another matter.

It is nothing short of three red rags waved by the speakers to the enraged bull of the Sri Lankan public, with the session moderator performing the role of a less than skilled matador.

President Dissanayake, who said that the term ‘retirement’ had now been introduced by the NPP into Sri Lankan politics, which has a history of politicians retiring only if they lost or died, noted that the withdrawal of most of the former Members of Parliament (MPs) from contesting the elections was one of the changes expected by the people.

I didn’t grow up with Batman or Superman I grew up with my dad. My father who in all honesty I modeled my life after in many ways. You see my father was so many things to so many people; one man who in his time played many parts. For some he was a leader of Marxist thought and rioter (in today’s vernacular that’s “an advocate for social change”). For others he was a teacher, a lecturer, a professor; an expert on electrical engineering and power systems, solar and wind (pun intended for he could clear a room). The details of my father’s accomplishments on these fields (except the wind) are sadly beyond my knowledge. However, from what I have read and heard the impact has been lasting.

Royal College, which has long been synonymous with excellence in academics, sports, and leadership, has especially shone in the realm of rugby, a sport that has been a bedrock of its identity for over a century.

However, the recent baseless efforts to discredit this remarkable legacy deserve close examination. In an environment where sportsmanship, dedication, and teamwork are core values, such efforts appear not only misinformed but also damaging to the young athletes who devote themselves to both their education and the sport, unfortunately.
