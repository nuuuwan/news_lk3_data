    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will replace a \u2018special commodity levy\u2019 with a new protectionist tax from January 01, State Minister Ranjit Siyambalapitiya said, which will give extra profit to farmers and keep food prices high.",
    "\u201cThe special commodity levy, which was used to protect domestic farmers and domestic producers, will be removed from January 01,\u201d Minister Siyambalapitiya said.",
    "The special commodity levy was advocated by then trade minister Bandula Gunawardana, as the US fired a commodity boom ahead of the collapse of a US housing bubble in a bid to reduce the tax on tax effect of duties, para-tariffs and make food taxes more transparent, according to some analysts.",
    "However, the tax came under fire due to being slapped at midnight as tax payers and the hungry were sleeping and its alleged manipulation to give profits to some importers.",
    "Meanwhile, Siyambalapitiya said, a new protectionist tax will be introduced to give protection to farmers after identifying the exact seasons that their produce comes to the market.",
    "Due to enjoying protection from politicians decades, many of Sri Lanka\u2019s food farmers, except for small holder tea and spice growers, cannot make export competitive products.",
    "If farmers were export competitive, the harvesting season should give the country a chance to export incomes (so-called foreign exchange) and the hungry to reduce child mal-nutrition by helping low-income families consume food at global prices, critics say."
