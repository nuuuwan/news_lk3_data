    "Jathika Jana Balawegaya(NPP) has unveiled a transformative national tourism policy aimed at rebranding Sri Lanka as a sustainable and experiential destination. Moving beyond the traditional mass-market tourism strategies, the new policy emphasizes high-end, niche markets and eco-friendly tourism practices that will leverage Sri Lanka\u2019s unique cultural and natural heritage.",
    "The think tank of the NPP spelled out to The Island Financial Review that under the proposed strategy, Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector will diversify its offerings to include ecology, gastronomy, traditional livelihoods, indigenous medicine and spiritual practices such as Buddhism.",
    "They will also focus on promoting marine archaeology, rural lifestyles and adventure-based tourism, all of which will form the authentic \u201csignature\u201d of the Sri Lankan experience. This shift is seen as essential to cater to modern travelers seeking immersive, experiential tourism over conventional round-trip tours.",
    "A key component of the policy is the creation of a division for Tourism Product Development under the Sri Lanka Tourism Authority. This division will collaborate with the private sector, industry stakeholders and local communities to foster innovative tourism products.",
    "NPP aims to formalize and standardize both existing and new tourism offerings, with an emphasis on developing tourism infrastructure in underutilized areas of the country, particularly during the off-season.",
    "In addition to eco-tourism, wellness tourism and community-based tourism (CBT), the policy also highlights the importance of promoting MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) tourism, which has been underutilized in the country. With the potential for cruise ship tourism and better catering to differently-abled tourists, the NPP sees untapped opportunities that can drive new revenue streams.",
    "NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said: \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s tourism potential goes beyond numbers. We are focusing on value, sustainability and the development of unique experiences that will attract high-yield markets and build long-term industry growth.\u201d",
    "In the aviation sector, the policy emphasizes the need to increase international air connectivity, particularly through low-cost carriers, while upgrading infrastructure at key airports like Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA). Plans are also in place to optimize underutilized airports in Jaffna, Hambantota and Batticaloa to support tourism growth. Domestic air travel will be expanded, including scenic air tours and adventure-based aviation products, such as, hot air ballooning and skydiving.",
