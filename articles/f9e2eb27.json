  "original_body_lines": [
    "Hamas leader Marwan Issa died in an Israeli air strike, White House official Jake Sullivan has said.",
    "As deputy military commander, Mr Issa would be Hamas\u2019s most senior leader to die since the war began on 7 October.",
    "The Palestinian group, which controls Gaza, has not officially commented on reports of his death.",
    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the Middle East this week on his sixth visit to the region since the conflict in Gaza erupted.",
    "He will hold meetings in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to discuss international efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that secures the release of all remaining hostages.",
    "Negotiations have been continuing this week in Qatar despite Israel announcing plans to move more than a million people from the city of Rafah before launching an offensive.",

    "Israeli media sources have reported that Mr Issa was killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza a week ago.",
    "The deputy commander of Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, was considered one of Israel\u2019s most-wanted men. The European Union, which placed the Hamas leader on its terrorist blacklist, linked him directly to the 7 October attack led by the group which killed approximately 1,200 people and sparked the war.",
    "He had been jailed by Israel for five years during the First Palestinian Intifada and detained by the Palestinian Authority in 1997 until the start of the Second Intifada in 2000.",
    "The Israeli military has killed a number of Hamas\u2019s senior leaders since 7 October. Hamas political leader Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut\u2019s southern suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel is widely considered responsible for that attack.",

    "He pledged that the US would aid Israeli in its continued hunt for top Hamas leaders, adding, \u201cJustice will come for them, too.\u201d",
    "But while he noted Israel\u2019s numerous military successes against Hamas since the start of the war, he also emphasised President Biden had expressed his growing alarm over the rising number of civilian deaths in his call to Mr Netanyahu.",
    "\u201cThe president told the prime minister again today that we share the goal of defeating Hamas, but we just believe you need a coherent and sustainable strategy to make that happen,\u201d he said.",
    "Mr Biden was able to get the Israeli leader to agree to sending a \u201csenior interagency team composed of military, intelligence and humanitarian officials\u201d to Washington in the coming days to discuss US concerns over an invasion of Rafah.",
    "The expectation is that Israel will delay its assault until that meeting is held, Mr Sullivan said.",
    "Mr Netanyahu confirmed the call on X, formerly Twitter, and said the two had \u201cdiscussed the latest developments in the war\u201d as well as Israel\u2019s goals in the conflict.",
    "The Israeli prime minister said those objectives included: \u201cEliminating Hamas, freeing all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never gain constitutes a threat to Israel - while providing the necessary humanitarian aid that will assist in achieving these goals.\u201d",
    "Prior to Mr Biden\u2019s call, senior Democrats in the US had grown more vocally critical of Mr Netanyahu.",
    "On Thursday, Chuck Schumer - the top Democrat in the Senate - called for new elections in Israel, saying that Mr Netanyahu was prioritising his \u201cpolitical survival\u201d over the country\u2019s needs.",
    "Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party pushed back, saying Israel was not a \u201cbanana republic\u201d and that the prime minister\u2019s policies were \u201csupported by a large majority\u201d.",
    "Mr Biden told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he knew Mr Schumer\u2019s remarks were coming. The president said, however, that the Senate leader had \u201cexpressed serious concern shared not only by him, but many Americans\u201d."
