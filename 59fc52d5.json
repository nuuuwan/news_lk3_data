    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe rejected a market speculation of the government\u2019s plan to announce domestic debt restructuring (DDR) on June 28 after it declared a special bank holiday on June 30.",
    "The special bank holiday will shut the island nation\u2019s financial markets for five days including three working days. June 29 is a public holiday in lieu of the Hajj festival celebrated by Muslims, while Monday July 3 is a Buddhist religious holiday in lieu of the full moon.",
    "Market analysts said the government\u2019s special bank holiday declaration will close banks for five days from June 29 to July 3 and that has led the market to speculate a possible DDR announcement on the government.",
    "DDR has been seen as negative and analysts say stock and bond markets may see negative sentiments when DDR is announced.",
    "\u201cNo DDR will be announced without the parliament approval,\u201d Minister Semasinghe told EconomyNext.",
    "The IMF last month said it has been \u201cin constant dialog with\u201d Sri Lanka on debt restructuring and it wants to make sure that Sri Lankan authorities are working on it and will meet the targets.",
    "\u201cOur role is to ensure that whatever debt restructuring strategy the authorities decide is consistent with debt targets that are designed for Sri Lanka to restore debt sustainability,\u201d Senior IMF Mission Chief Peter Breuer said on May 15 when the global lender\u2019s delegation was in Colombo.",
    "\u201cAs such we do not have any particular view on how the burden should be distributed whether they are external or domestic. Having said that, we do have a keen interest to ensure that the domestic economy and the domestic financial system continues to work and are stable.\u201d",
    "The IMF as well as the Sri Lankan government had expected restructuring including with foreign creditors to be completed in time for the first review of the program by September.",
    "Sources from the government said the special leave on June 30 was declared because traditionally the last day of June and December had been bank holidays in the past, though this practice was changed after 1998. (Colombo/June 23/2023)"
