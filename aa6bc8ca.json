    "In response to the escalating challenges posed by climate change and its impact on water resources, the Government has taken a significant step towards effective water management with the introduction of the National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Management Mechanism.",
    "The country has experienced severe climate change conditions over the past decade, placing it among the countries most affected by these changes globally. Recognising the urgency of the situation the Government has responded to the national demand for a more pragmatic water resources policy. An expert committee, chaired by Prof. C.M. Maddumabandara, a former Vice-Chancellor of Peradeniya University, and representing relevant fields, has meticulously prepared the National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Management Mechanism.",
    "The policy and mechanism aim to address the multifaceted challenges in managing the country\u2019s water resources effectively. By adopting a comprehensive and integrated approach, the Government seeks to ensure the sustainable utilisation and conservation of water, promoting resilience and equitable access across all sectors.",
    "The preparation of the National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Management Mechanism involved close collaboration with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.",
    "\u201cGiven this uncontrollable climate variability, the management of limited water resources for drinking, irrigation, energy, and other needs have become an increasingly complex task,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Banduala Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "The changing climate patterns have resulted in a decrease in monsoon rainfall in the dry regions of Sri Lanka whilst the wet zone of the country has witnessed increased rainfall. This shift has led to unexpected and severe droughts and floods, leaving the population vulnerable to extreme weather events.",
    "The proposal to this effect submitted by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.",
    "\u201cImplementation of the National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Management Mechanism aims to optimise water usage, enhance water security, and reduce the vulnerability of communities to climate-related water challenges. The policy will serve as a roadmap for sustainable water management, considering the needs of both present and future generations,\u201d he added."
