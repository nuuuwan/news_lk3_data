    "We come across, in science fiction, the concept of mirror universe, which is an alternative reality or a parallel version of our universe with dramatic, ironic and inverted differences. What reminded us of this well-known sci-fi trope was a scathing propaganda attack carried out by a former JVP heavyweight on the incumbent JVP-led NPP administration, which resembles a mirror-universe version of the government it promised to create; it has the same characters but is driven by opposite principles and values. The digital realm is full of speeches the JVP/NPP leaders made before last year\u2019s regime change, and they are in sharp contrast to what the incumbent leaders are doing.",
    "Soon after President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s participation in a recent ceremony to mark the grand opening of an upscale integrated resort complete with a casino, in Colombo, former Propaganda Secretary of the JVP Wimal Weerawansa played, at a press conference, a video of a fiery speech made by Dissanayake as an Opposition MP, condemning the casino culture. Inveighing against the then government for a move to allow James Packer, a casino tycoon, to launch an integrated resort in Sri Lanka, Dissanayake warns of an exponential spread of narcotics and prostitution. That casino project did not materialise mostly due to protests. However, Chairman of the newly-opened mega casino, Lawrence Ho, has said; \u201cSri Lanka can be to India what Macau is to China.\u201d What has become of the JVP\u2019s moral compass?",
    "There are many other old videos where JVP leaders vehemently oppose key projects, such as the Colombo Port City, which Dissanayake condemns as an environmental disaster. Today, the JVP-led administration has made about-turns, which are legion. A video shows Dissanayake, making a special statement in Parliament, on 11 August 2023, about the previous government\u2019s decision to award a tender for the printing of digital NICs to an India company. An English translation of what he said in Sinhala is as follows: \u201cVital information of every citizen including the blood type of each of them, will be in the hands of the Indian company. They will have access to all data, ranging from demographic to biometric information of the people. Today, the world is not ruled by the power of weapons but by data \u2026.\u201d The JVP-led government is now all out to award the digital NIC tender to an Indian company! Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa has said the fear of India gaining access to sensitive data about Sri Lankan citizens through the NIC project is unfounded. He has contradicted what his leader told Parliament!",
    "The present-day leaders came to power, promising to disband the VVIP security divisions. In a video that has gone viral, Dissanayake himself makes this promise during his Opposition days, and in another Sunil Handunnetti says neither the President nor the Prime Minister should be provided with special security and they must move about like the ordinary people. Assuring that the President and the Prime Minister will have no special security under an NPP government, he asks the media and the public to keep the video of his promise and use it against the NPP in case that promise goes unfulfilled. The blanket deployment of security personnel at events attended by President Dissanayake and Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya is reminiscent of the atmosphere in the political thriller, The Day of the Jackal.",
    "The Opposition has called upon the NPP government to disclose the conditions on which the US reduced its trade tariff for Sri Lanka to 20%. Obviously, the Trump administration would not have done so out of altruism. Some countries have agreed to purchase Boeing aircraft, etc., from the US. Time was when the JVP/NPP\u2008leaders thundered both in and outside Parliament, asking the previous governments to make public the agreements they had entered into with other countries and international organisations. The NPP made a song and dance about the SLPP administration\u2019s agreement with the IMF. Those agreements are now in the public domain, but the NPP government does not uphold transparency where its agreements with foreign governments are concerned.",
    "Past administrations hardly fulfilled their election pledges and did exactly the opposite of what they had promised; they were guided by the Machiavellian counsel that the promise given was a necessity of the past and the word broken is a necessity of the present. The NPP promised to make a difference, but its government seems locked in a mirror universe, with its key figures operating as morally inverted doubles of their previous images.",
