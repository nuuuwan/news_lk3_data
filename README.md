ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s next parliament will be a more balanced one if parliamentary elections are held before a presidential election and won’t result in any one party monopolising political power, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) national organiser Basil Rajapaksa said.

In an exclusive interview given to the privately owned NewsFirst network on Thursday March 14 , Rajapaksa said power should not be concentrated around one party.

“The party that wins the presidential election may secure unlimited power. I don’t think that’s a good situation.

“No one will be washed away or disappear. This was why the proportional representation system was introduced. We showed that that was of no use,” he added.

### Japan’s same-sex marriage bar is unconstitutional, high court says

TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japan's bar on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, the high court in the northern city of Sapporo said on Thursday, the first such ruling by an appeals court on a matter that has divided the lower levels of the judiciary.

Japan is the only Group of Seven nation without legal protection for same-sex unions. Although backed by 70% of the public, they are opposed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

Japanese civil code rules that limit marriage to those of opposite sexes are "unconstitutional" and "discriminatory", the Sapporo High Court said in its ruling, but dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for damages from the government.

"Enacting same-sex marriage does not seem to cause disadvantages or harmful effects," the court said.

"I thought the ruling might be a conservative one, but it ended up exceeding my expectations," one plaintiff, who did not disclose his name, told reporters after the ruling. "I couldn't help but cry."

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s debt is so high that even the world’s richest person would struggle to help out, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, noting that recovering stolen assets from a few individuals would not cover the total accumulated debt.

Wickremesinghe was responding to a question asked by an audience member at an event in Colombo on Wednesday March 13 who suggested that recovering stolen funds could significantly ease Sri Lanka’s debt burden.

“Firstly, if you look at our debt, I don’t think we can do that even if we go to the richest person in the world. We have taken that much debt. If someone says you can take back the money that one or two persons took out of Sri Lanka and solve this, that is utterly false,” said Wickremesinghe.

The audience member also alluded to assets allegedly stolen by the leadership of the previous administration.
