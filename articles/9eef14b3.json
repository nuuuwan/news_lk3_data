    "The life, and violent death, of Neelan Tiruchelvam is the subject of a new documentary by young Canadian Tamil director Pitasanna Shanmugathas. Its title is apt. In life Tiruchelvam was silenced in July 1999 by the LTTE suicide bomber who threw himself onto the eminent Sri Lankan Tamil lawyer turned politician\u2019s car close to his Colombo office.",
    "Both before and since that grimly characteristic Tiger response to opponents, real and imagined, Shanmugathan suggests, there have been other silences around Tiruchelvam. During his life, resolute espousal of a pluralistic, equity-based approach to resolving Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic conflict won Tiruchelvam\u2019s many friends but also plenty of enemies, and on both sides of the ethnic divide.",
    "Partly as a result, it was only really later in life that Tiruchelvam\u2019s voice began to gain a wider audience, notably within official Sri Lankan and international human rights circles \u2013 the latter via a combination of academic connections with Harvard University, and political links to organisations such as the US National Democratic Institute (NDI), a number of whose international election observation missions he participated.",
    "All in all, for anyone with an interest in modern Sri Lankan history, in particular the ethnic conflict, this documentary offers an absorbing story. Starting with Tiruchelvam\u2019s father, himself a noted politician during an earlier stage of Tamil attempts to respond to overarching Sinhala majoritarianism in the aftermath of independence, it goes on to chart his progress from gifted law student to the higher echelons of academia, human rights activism and the national political arena.",
    "Shanmugathas\u2019 documentary is too long: running at nearly 2.5 hours, in an increasingly short-attention span era it is likely to tax the attentions of anyone but the most dedicated viewer. There are a few technical glitches too \u2013 some abrupt cuts, the occasional, presumably interviewer\u2019s voice speaking off mike in the background. And for all their inherent interest, some sections, notably those touching on Tiruchelvam\u2019s father and his son\u2019s engagement with NDI could profitably have been reduced in length.",
    "These quibbles aside, this is an absorbing and well-conceived documentary that brings together an extensive range of Tamil and Sinhala voices \u2013 including, I was pleased to note, a prominent Tamil critic of Tiruchelvam. Indeed, in the interests of overall balance Shanmugathas could usefully have included more such voices. The strongest section is the one dealing with Tiruchelvam\u2019s role in the formulation of Chandrika Kumaratunga\u2019s 1995 \u2018Union of the Regions\u2019 constitutional reform proposals, by common consent the most radical and far-reaching effort so far to outline a political proposal aimed at addressing critical issues underlying the ethnic conflict.",
    "Tiruchelvam comes to the fore here because he is depicted \u2013 rightly \u2013 as having played a, if not the central role in formulating the Kumaratunga proposals, which centred on replacing a constitutional formula defining the country as a \u2018unitary state\u2019 with a federalist-type provision for recasting it as a \u2018Union of Regions\u2019.",
    "To Tiruchelvam\u2019s eternal chagrin the proposals were eventually withdrawn in the face of determined criticism from the opposition UNP, led by a youngish Ranil Wickremesinghe, with the massed ranks of Sinhala nationalists utterly opposed to any suggestion of constitutional dilution, let alone perceived treachery, providing the chorus. Equally important, as the documentary highlights, was the LTTE\u2019s response to the proposals, namely: silence.",
    "This political omerta effectively pulled the rug out from under Kumaratunga\u2019s attempt to build a cross-ethnic constituency in support of her reform proposals. Among the critics of the LTTE\u2019s studied silence, it is poignant to hear Kumaratunga\u2019s onetime Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar \u2013 also later assassinated by the LTTE \u2013 lambasting the Tiger\u2019s silence in characteristically eloquent fashion.",
    "In the end, it took Kumaratunga another five years to table a fresh set of reform proposals, in 2000, proposals that were eventually watered down significantly in response to renewed political pressure from the Sinhala nationalist lobby. Following their tabling in autumn 2000, the UNP went so far as to burn a copy in protest inside parliament, while the LTTE simply rejected them out of hand.",
    "The most intriguing commentary on this episode, however, is provided by Norwegian ex-Sri Lanka peace facilitator Erik Solheim. Based on his experiences of dealing with the LTTE leadership during the peace talks of the early 2000s, Solheim suggests that the Government\u2019s biggest mistake with the 1995 \u2018Union of the Regions\u2019 proposal centred more on process than their actual content.",
    "Specifically, Solheim suggests that for all their habitual political bluster, the Tiger leadership \u2013 supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran in particular \u2013 were highly sensitive to how they felt they were being treated by Sri Lankan officialdom. In this instance, he claims, Kumaratunga\u2019s proposals were never formally communicated to the Tigers: allegedly, Prabhakaran only got to know of their contents via other, informal channels, this perceived slight leading him to maintain silent protest in response. When the Tigers expected formal, diplomatic-style treatment in line with their self-perceived status, and didn\u2019t get it, they reacted strongly to what they perceived as the Government\u2019s studied nonchalance \u2013 intended or otherwise \u2013 towards them. As the old song has it, \u2018it ain\u2019t what you do, it\u2019s the way that you do it\u2019.",
    "Whether Solheim is right here is a matter for discussion \u2013 a discussion that would be greatly assisted were any of the LTTE leadership still alive to tell the story from their viewpoint. But they aren\u2019t, leaving us to look to secondary sources to try and help us piece together this particular puzzle. In a related context, too, any researcher able to unearth any hard evidence of what the Tigers really thought about Tiruchelvam \u2013 and indeed, the constitutional reform proposals he engineered \u2013 beyond the label of \u2018traitor\u2019 habitually heaped on him by Tamil nationalists would be rendering genuine service.",
    "This, together with the voice of other critics of Tiruchelvam\u2019s politics, is something Shanmugathas\u2019 documentary could usefully have explored further. A similar point applies to his assassination, which is only covered in outline. Who exactly ordered his killing, and who carried it out? How was it set up? And how much contact did Tiruchelvam have with the Tigers in the run-up to his death or indeed previously (we\u2019re told he received a warning some weeks earlier \u2013 from who?). Without dwelling on his assassination\u2019s gory details, these are questions it would have been useful to see the documentary address.",
    "None of these caveats fundamentally detracts, however, from this documentary\u2019s essential qualities. Overall, it provides a fitting, well-presented tribute to one of the most honourable, important, if often neglected figures in modern Sri Lankan history.",
