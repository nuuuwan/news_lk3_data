The series of public welfare activities by the Silk Road Link in Sri Lanka is in line with Xi\u2019s vision for Small Yet Smart public welfare projects in BRI countries, helping to build bridges of people-to-people connection and advancing the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Sri Lanka, as well as supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s vision to realise \u201cA Thriving Nation, A Beautiful Life.\u201d",
    "The International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is responsible for the Party\u2019s foreign affairs work. Leaders of many South Asian and Southeast Asian political parties have expressed a wish to use party-to-party channels to carry out more practical and people-benefiting cooperation projects. To support this, the International Department\u2019s Bureau 1 set up the Silk Road Link platform for practical cooperation and people-to-people exchange with South and Southeast Asian countries. There are five projects under the platform, the Silk Road Embarkment, the Silk Road Empowerment, the Silk Road Enlightenment, the Silk Road Enjoyment and the Silk Road Enhancement. This platform coordinates resources from Chinese local governments, educational institutions, businesses, and organisations to carry out activities such as technical skill training, convenience services, study abroad and short-term exchanges, business cooperation, and cultural exchanges. Silk Road Link contributes to deepening the friendship between the CPC and the political parties of these regional countries, and promoting friendly ties and mutual understanding between the peoples."
