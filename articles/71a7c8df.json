    "An Executive Order signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, imposing an additional 25% tariff on India for importing oil from Russia, has sent the Indian exporters reeling. Trump, in his wisdom, thinks that oil imports from Russia, whether direct or through intermediaries, present an \u2018unusual and extraordinary\u2019 threat to the US and therefore justify emergency economic measures. He may have expected India to plead for relief, just like other countries, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has struck a defiant note, vowing not to compromise India\u2019s interests at any cost. He has said India will have to pay a heavy price for it, but it under his leadership is ready for any eventuality. Kudos to him for his bold stand.",
    "However, political pressure is mounting on PM Modi at home to protect the India exporters vis-\u00e0-vis prohibitive and disruptive US tariffs. Kerala Finance Minister K. N. Balagopal has reportedly asked the BJP-led Central government how it is planning to sort out the tariff issue. Other states are likely to follow suit, with the Congress, etc., cranking up pressure on Modi to find a solution fast. Maybe Trump is waiting for political pressure to escalate in India and make the Modi government amenable to the US conditions for a tariff reduction. It is now a game of chicken between Trump and Modi.",
    "The high-stakes trade showdown the US and India are locked in is sure to hurt both nations badly. Indian exporters are protesting, and Washington is risking its strategic alliance with India by pushing the Modi government against the wall.",
    "India may have been confident that as a Quad member it would be able to import oil from Russia without objections from Washington. President Trump\u2019s latest Executive Order has come as a rude shock for the Modi administration. Perhaps, the ongoing US tariff drama will have a happy ending for India, with Trump walking back his decision to impose additional tariffs at issue and agreeing to reduce the previously imposed tariffs as well. Trump has earned notoriety for such about-turns. India is too important to be bullied, and geopolitical concerns may compel Trump to change his mind sooner than expected, but whether Washington will be able to regain India\u2019s trust as a strategic partner remains to be seen.",
    "The key lesson of the US tariff narrative is that Washington has no concern for its strategic partners when it furthers its economic and military interests ruthlessly. The predicament of Ukraine under Zelensky\u2019s leadership is a case in point. It was at the behest of the US-led West that Ukraine antagonised Russia to the extent of provoking a military backlash, but the US is now eyeing Ukraine\u2019s minerals in return for military assistance! Zelensky should have known better than to rely on the US to fight a war with Russia. Public resentment at his government is palpable; it spilt over onto the streets last month when he sought to curtail the independence of Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption institutions. It has not abated even though he has reversed his decision, with the Ukrainian youth, who took to the streets to defeat his attempt to tame anti-graft outfits, declaring victory. There is no guarantee that protests will not erupt again over other issues. Ukraine cannot go on fighting a war indefinitely, and is very unlikely to achieve its NATO dream. This is something India, which the US is using as a counterweight to China, should take cognisance of.",
    "In an interesting turn of event, China has lambasted the additional US tariffs on India over purchasing Russian oil and called it tariff abuse. China is also a major importer of Russian oil, but the US has not imposed any additional tariffs on it, according to international media reports.",
    "Interestingly, the Trump-Putin talks, reportedly on the cards, are expected to ease US sanctions on Russia although the US is penalising India for buying oil from Russia! India should be able to do what is good for it, the way the US does. Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems to believe that the US alone has a right to do so, and other nations must subjugate their interests to those of the US.",
    "One can only hope that the Asian economic powers, such as China and India, at loggerheads and embroiled in border disputes, will realise that the US tariff hikes are just a foretaste of what is to come, mend fences and close ranks to face emerging global challenges and threats to them, through strategic alliances, like BRICS.",
