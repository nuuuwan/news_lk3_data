    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday accused the Government of attempting to destroy Sri Lanka\u2019s free health service. \u201cThe Government has embarked on a mission to destroy the country\u2019s free health service by using various means such as financial waste, corruption, fraud, importation of substandard medicinal drugs and equipment along with suppression, state terrorism, concealing information from the people and launching witch hunts against health professionals revealing information about the health service crisis,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The opposition leader liked the Government\u2019s actions as an act of terrorism. Premadasa made these comments at the inaugural meeting of the special opposition leader\u2019s parliamentary committee led by him.",
    "Premadasa said the Government has disregarded procurement procedures in obtaining medicinal drugs by using S. 109 of the act. \u201cThey are conducting medical businesses over the bodies of the people. As a result of sub-standard anaesthesia being administered children and many others have lost their lives,\u201d he alleged.",

He also said while health professionals have begun to leave the country, those who remain are being hunted down by the Government.",

He accused the Government of attempting to conceal the true facts and penalising medical professionals who dare to reveal the true information to the people.\u00a0 The opposition leader said he will support health professionals who have bravely stood for the truth and even foot their legal bills.",
    "Premadasa said all those involved in concealing fraud and corruption in the health sector will be brought before justice under a Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Government. \u201cThose who knowingly engage in criminal activities, who knowingly bring in inferior drugs leading to the loss of human lives, will be severely punished by the law,\u201d he said.",
    "He assured he and his party will oppose the Government in and outside parliament regarding the rampant corruption in the health sector including those relating to the importation of drugs.",
