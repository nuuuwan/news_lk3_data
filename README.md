As far as Tamil politics is concerned, the parliamentary election will be a big challenge. It is not possible to say that how many teams will compete from the Tamil nationality. Three or four teams have the opportunity to compete.

The Tamil National Party can contest alone, the Tamil National People's Front and the Democratic Tamil National Alliance alone.

May try to put pressure on them to go to the coalition. At least the Tamil state party and the Democratic Tamil National Alliance may be forced to act as the Old Tamil National Alliance.
