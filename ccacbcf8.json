    "Of the total cases, 22 males and three females are in the age between 15-24 while other cases are individuals above 25.",
    "Commenting on the situation, Dr Janaki Vidanapathirana, the Director at National STD/AIDS Control Programme told Daily Mirror, the increase in testing capacity has resulted in more cases being recorded across the country.",
    "\"The highest cases are reported from the Western Province,\" she said.",
    "\"There is a 43 percent increase in the cases reported in 2022 compared to 2021. This is due to people coming for testing after the lockdown triggered by the pandemic, she added.",
    "Dr Vidanapathirana also highlighted the importance of properly delivering sex education to children as they have observed a lack of proper deliverance of sex education to children in Sri Lanka.",
    "Thus, she advised people to choose less risky sexual behaviors and take precautions, such as using a condom to keep HIV at bay. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
