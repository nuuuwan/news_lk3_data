    "Having passed the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service Exam in 1988, Mr. R. M. M. Ratnayake had initially assumed duties as principal of a national school in the Kandy education zone. He then served as principal of Galagedara Madya Maha Vidyalaya, Katugastota Rahula Vidyalaya, Maliyadeva College Kurunegala, Mahinda Rajapaksa Vidyalaya, Homagama and D. S Senanayake College in addition to serving in several key positions at the Education Ministry. It was in November 2022 that he accepted the post of Principal at Royal College, Colombo while serving as an Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Education.\u00a0 A week prior to his retirement, Mr. Ratnayake sat down for a candid interview with the Daily Mirror where he spoke extensively about the work done during his tenure; especially with regards to rectifying certain matters of concern that had arisen within the school administration.",
    "Q: What were the challenges you faced while serving in this position?",
    "There were several issues that had to be resolved at the time I joined the school. One of them was regarding the student selected for the Dornhorst Memorial Prize which is awarded to the Most Outstanding student in the school. When this was brought to my attention I advised the advisory committee to reconsider the selection of prefects. Deserving students were left out while some students were selected in an ad hoc manner. As a result there were issues among teachers and students as well. But we managed to rectify these matters in the best interest of the students.",
    "Another issue was with regards to the bilingual education system. At the time I joined there were five cases filed at the Human Rights Commission against the selection of students for the bilingual education programme. Around 750 students face this exam and around 150 of them are being selected. We are aware of the fact that children need some kind of education in the English medium in this day and age. But children are being deprived of these opportunities. Thereafter I discussed with the School Development Committee and the Old Boys\u2019 Union and we conducted a survey. One of the claims was that we didn\u2019t have sufficient teachers in case the number of classes was increased. We then did a survey to analyze how many teachers are required and we found that we needed a teacher for only one subject. This shows that the staff was having a wrong perception regarding increasing the number of teachers. Thereafter we were able to recruit a teacher for geography and civics. However we had an issue with regards to selecting children from a Scholarship Exam. We were able to select only a few students, but we are planning to include more students from results obtained from the second term examination.",
    "Then there was a case filed regarding the difference in cut-off marks for students willing to pursue bilingual education in Sinhala and Tamil mediums. Through this programme we teach science, mathematics, geography/civics, health, literature and IT in the English medium. Other subjects are taught in respective mediums. There were issues when students join one class to study bilingual subjects, but we were able to rectify them accordingly.",
    "The problem is our students still learn in classrooms built during the 19th Century and are being taught by teachers born in the 20th Century. But children are already in the 21st Century. Therefore they are more advanced thanks to technology and it is a must that these reforms are being introduced almost immediately",
    "Students sit for London O/L examination when they are in Grade 9. By Grade 10 they have completed London A/Ls as well. Therefore we may not be able to retain students in the school beyond Grade 9 if a transformation of the curriculum is not done. We have already drafted a proposal to introduce London O/L and A/L examination in government schools",
    "Another issue was regarding hostel facilities. Even though there were 117 scholarship students we were only able to accommodate 50. There were students from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa areas as well. Preference is given to children from low income families in faraway areas. We don\u2019t accommodate children from the Western province. But parents insisted that we increase the total number of students seeking hostel facilities to 97. We decided to include bunker beds and improve facilities, but then parents also insisted we pursue with this endeavour. What we observed is that most students who come from rural areas are not proficient in English. Therefore we are conducting an English programme for students at the hostel every Tuesday and Thursday. We also introduced sports such as tennis and swimming, so that students from rural areas can interact with children from Colombo, so that they too could socialise with one another. We also have a programme to reward the most outstanding student in the hostel.",
    "Children from rural areas may feel homesick once they come to Colombo. They experience a change of environment and might drop out of studies. As a remedy we introduced a concept called the host family where a student from a rural area can make friends with a student from Colombo and they can take this student on outings etc., so that they don\u2019t feel a difference.",
    "There were changes made to the administration hierarchy, hence there are assistant principals in charge of respective sections to rectify any issues. We made a plan to retain teachers in their respective sections and all classes were brought under one section so that teachers don\u2019t have to spend time going from one class to another. There is also an initiative to improve the quality and standards of the school. For this there are eight recommendations issued including student welfare, physical resource management, community relationships and so on. We have appointed teachers from relevant sections for this initiative.",
    "We have also been able to rectify issues with regards to sports and extracurricular activities. Each sports teacher has been given a set of targets to achieve. Previously we were in the seventh place among other schools in this education zone, but this time we came second in the rankings. Therefore teachers should take the full responsibility of tasks assigned to them.",
    "One of the challenges we are likely to face in future is the lack of students in senior classes. This is because students sit for London O/L examination when they are in Grade 9. By Grade 10 they have completed London A/Ls as well. Therefore we may not be able to retain students in the school beyond Grade 9 if a transformation of the curriculum is not done. We have already drafted a proposal to introduce London O/L and A/L examination in government schools. Otherwise they waste much time while awaiting results. The authorities are yet to receive the GCE O/L Examination results. If these exams are not introduced students will sit for foundation courses and pursue their degrees.",
    "Q:\u00a0\u00a0You spoke about several discrepancies that have occurred in the school. How do such incidents affect a child\u2019s education?",
    "If we don\u2019t introduce a proper methodology it will be unfair by other students. There may be one student who excels only in sports.\u00a0 But there may be another student who participates in sports, competitions, extracurricular activities while doing his studies. This child is likely to develop a balanced personality. However, there is a chance that the former child may have higher scores. This was one aspect that we wanted to change. We then collaborated with the National Productivity Secretariat to assess the productivity of various clubs and societies in the school. Sometimes children might be discouraged when they aren\u2019t rewarded for their talents. This time there were 298 applications for the selection of prefects which means that there is a transparent and fair process underway.",
    "Q:\u00a0How important is it to appreciate children for their talents from a psychological point of view?",
    "It is important to encourage children from their childhood. If they hear no for an answer they will be discouraged from doing what they like doing. Take a rugby match for instance. As soon as the match ends the crowd disappears and there\u2019s no one to speak to the team. Therefore they will be discouraged when they feel that they have been left out after the match. But all these habits were changed. I personally visit the matches, speak to the team and appreciate their efforts. We need to develop such compassion towards one another. It\u2019s not about winning all the time. Take a parent-teachers meeting for example; how many parents visit the school when their children are in senior classes? It\u2019s like they have already neglected their children. When children see their parents they will be encouraged to do better. Parents need to be more vigilant about their children and spend more time with them especially at this day and age.",
    "What we observed is that most students who come from rural areas are not proficient in English. Therefore we are conducting an English programme for students at the hostel every Tuesday and Thursday. We also introduced sports such as tennis and swimming, so that students from rural areas can interact with children from Colombo, so that they too could socialise with one another",
    "We still follow syllabi that were compiled in 2018. But these are already outdated. Discussions were underway to bring about education reforms, but it will take some time to introduce them into school curricula. Our education system should cater to the child of the 21st Century. We need teachers who think alike. But the problem is our students still learn in classrooms built during the 19th Century and are being taught by teachers born in the 20th Century. But children are already in the 21st Century. Therefore they are more advanced thanks to technology and it is a must that these reforms are being introduced almost immediately. On the other hand many schools are divided according to ethnicity, religion etc. I believe that these concepts should be changed if we are to move forward as a progressive society.",
    "We have also been able to rectify issues with regards to sports and extracurricular activities. Each sports teacher has been given a set of targets to achieve. Previously we were in the seventh place among other schools in this education zone, but this time we came second in the rankings. Therefore teachers should take the full responsibility of tasks assigned to them.",
    "Q:\u00a0There seems to be various political interferences during school admissions. What are your observations regarding this?",
    "If a directive is issued by the Education Ministry regarding a particular student then we have to admit that student to our school. But according to the new circular school principals have been vested with the power to approve school admissions from Grade 2 upwards. We hold interviews and if a child has scored less we make the child aware of the breakdown of his marks. There is also a legal committee to check matters if forged documents are being produced during the admission of a child.",
    "Q:\u00a0It\u2019s a known fact that most parents force their children to excel in studies. What is your message to parents?",
    "More than educational qualifications most organizations now look at the skills of job applicants. During the COVID pandemic there were good results for O/L and A/L Examinations because children were confined to their homes. But it is important to participate in extracurricular activities because mental and physical stability is essential in order to remember what they learn in the classroom. Parents don\u2019t send their children for sil programmes (Buddhist religious programmes) anymore. But instead they would be sent to a class. Children need the experience. They should know what team spirit is. They learn by watching how a sports meet or any other event is being organised. Participation is key. In conclusion I hope that the activities commenced during my tenure would be continued under the leadership of my successors."
