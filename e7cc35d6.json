    "Rockland is Sri Lanka\u2019s first commercial distillery, established in 1924. It was first commissioned under the British government to manufacture high quality Coconut Arrack in Ceylon, which remains a distinct passion of the company. The art of sourcing toddy- which is distilled to make Coconut Arrack is traditionally passed on from one generation to another. Over time this has become a dying art, left unattended, like other local crafts such as lacemaking, cane furniture and wood carving. The art of toddy tapping too could possibly disappear as a unique capability in Sri Lanka.",
    "In this context, Rockland has successfully established a programme to collaborate with the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) and NAITA (National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority) to preserve and develop the art and craft of toddy tapping in the country. NAITA, is the foremost state body with the capacity to provide industry acceptable technical and vocational training through an island wide network of fully fledged training facilities that utilize standardised techniques.",
    "Rockland Distilleries together with the CRI and NAITA have developed a proprietary methodology that is progressive in its approach to train a new generation of tappers. With the required financial investment, the Company has tailormade a 4-month programme that can accommodate up to 5 batches annually, resulting in the total empowerment of over 50 new tappers a year.",
    "The programme will consist of the tappers learning safety standards while introducing modern technology and methods into the trade via theoretical and practical training modules at the Coconut Research Institute in Lunuwila. This will be followed by on-ground training under stringent safety guidelines for two months.",
