Suranga Wellalage, the father of Sri Lankan national team cricketer Dunith Wellalage, has passed away at the age of 54.

Suranga Wellalage, who was a former cricketer himself, has reportedly died following a sudden heart attack.

The Sri Lankan all-rounder’s  father had passed away on September 18, the same day his son featured in the Asia Cup Group B match against Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi.

Dunith, 22, received the tragic news only after the match had ended, which Sri Lanka won by six wickets to progress unbeaten to the Super Four stage.

Wellalage departed early this morning from Abu Dhabi, accompanied by team manager Mahinda Halangoda, according to reports.

The heartbreaking news reached Wellalage inside the dressing room. Initially informed of a medical emergency at home, he was soon told of his father’s passing, reports said.

Head Coach Sanath Jayasuriya, visibly emotional upon hearing the news, was seen in tears and later spent time comforting the young all-rounder.

### Strong quake off Russia Far East, tsunami alert lifted

*2025-09-19 06:49:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112657/strong-quake-off-russia-far-east-tsunami-alert-lifted) · `en`

A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia’s far eastern Kamchatka peninsula early Friday (Sep 19), rocking buildings and prompting authorities to issue a tsunami alert, later lifted.

Videos posted on Russian social media showed furniture and light fixtures shaking in homes, while another showed a parked car rocking back and forth on a street.

The quake struck 128km east of the region’s capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and at a shallow depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported.

The local branch of Russia’s state geophysical service gave a lower estimated magnitude of 7.4. It reported at least five aftershocks.

The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for possible hazardous waves along nearby coastlines, but said several hours later that the threat had passed.

“This morning is once again testing the resilience of Kamchatka residents,” the governor of the region, Vladimir Solodov, said on Telegram.

‘Janani’, the initiative conducted across 15 districts in 2023 and 2024 (prior to the local authorities poll) by the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) to enhance the digital literacy of female councillors of local authorities and help them stay safe online was well accepted and a tremendous success.

With a large number of first-time female councillors having been elected to local authorities at the last local authorities poll, CaFFE has heeded the many requests received and with the generous financial support of the Embassy of Switzerland in Sri Lanka will conduct the program in the 10 districts which were left out in the first phase.

Australia’s newly appointed High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Matthew Duckworth chose an unconventional way to introduce himself to the country via an interesting video message highlighting trade, education, development, and people-to-people ties between the two nations.

By hopping into a tuk-tuk and taking a tour of Colombo, Duckworth said in his first video message: “I’ve just arrived, and honestly, I’m thrilled to be here. I’ve always wanted to experience the energy, beauty, and rich culture of Sri Lanka first-hand,” adding that his focus will be on strengthening bilateral ties.

At a bustling Colombo market, he pointed to trade as a cornerstone of the partnership.

“Australians drink a lot of Ceylon Tea, but did you know Sri Lankans love Australian lentils? In fact, 85% of the lentils in this market are from Australia. We’re even helping Sri Lanka become a processing hub for the entire region,” he explained.

### The year that was: thrashing  towards NPP’s thriving nation

*2025-09-19 06:29:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-year-that-was-thrashing-towards-NPP-s-thriving-nation/4-781895) · `en`

That the NPP-dominated House is starting to walk the talk on promises that its leader made on his remarkable campaign trail must redound to the credit of every one of those 159 National People’s Power MPs

As the first year of a House commandeered by the NPP has come round, it is timely, appropriate and opportune to examine the track record of a tyro government in the 365 days just past.

It is timely because the traditional honeymoon period, in which a people content from only recently casting the ballot cut a newbie administration a gracious slice of charitable slack, is now over.

And there is no more appropriate a motive than keeping the NPP, led by the JVP, those vociferous critics of past regimes, accountable in just and similar vein.

Also opportune because the National People’s Power produced a fait accompli to coincide with its first anniversary in parliament and in power to justify its erstwhile campaign trail promises.

### Sri Lanka’s hollow democracy: Need to awaken and reclaim our nation

*2025-09-19 06:25:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-hollow-democracy-Need-to-awaken-and-reclaim-our-nation/4-781894) · `en`

Parliamentarians no longer represent the people but act as protectors of privilege, brokers of fraud, and breakers of law

I often wonder whether our nation’s founders ever paused to reflect before adopting the foundational principles of Democratic, Socialist, and Republic to define the country. A nation’s self-identification shapes not only its domestic policies but also its relationship with its people and its place in the world. Misinterpreting or inconsistently applying these terms risks deep conflict, ideological, institutional, and social, which we have adequately experienced. Before judging the merits of this identity, we must return to the fundamentals of democracy: does it serve some of the people some of the time, or all of the people all of the time?

Close on 13 years after the matter came up for discussion in Geneva it continues to be debated

In June 2010, the Secretary-General appointed the Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka to advise him on accountability issues in Sri Lanka and offered it as a resource to the Government, and particularly to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.

The title of this article goes back to 2012 when the Human Rights Council used it for the first of succeeding annual resolutions on Sri Lanka.

### JVP-led NPP Govt. must take meaningful action to end illegal Indian fishing in northern waters

The Tamil Nadu fishers have displayed unbelievable hostility and animus towards their Tamil speaking counterparts in Sri Lanka

The ongoing problem of illegal fishing and bottom trawling in Sri Lanka’s northern territorial waters by Indian fishers from Tamil Nadu state was described in detail in the first part of this article published last week. Particular attention was devoted to the bogey of Katchatheevu being raised by the Indian side to sidetrack the issue. As emphasised previously the fundamental problem is illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters and not the question of Katchatheevu islet ownership. Certain salient points regarding the illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu fishers will be related in this second and final part of this article.

### Crossing the Tax Rubicon

*2025-09-19 06:09:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Crossing-the-Tax-Rubicon/4-781891) · `en`

Like Caesar’s crossing of the Rubicon, every tax decision carries lasting consequences

The phrase “crossing the Rubicon” has travelled from ancient Rome into modern language as a metaphor for making a decision from which there is no turning back. Its origins date to 49 BCE, when Julius Caesar, confronted with a political deadlock, led his army across the Rubicon River an act that defied the Roman Senate and marked the beginning of a civil war that forever changed Rome’s destiny. As Caesar reportedly declared, “The die is cast.” In that single moment, he understood that there was no possibility of retreat, only the certainty of consequences. The step across the river was not just military defiance; it was the point of no return, carrying outcomes that would reshape both his own fate and the future of the Republic.

### Nobility of professions is  being traded for silver and gold

While the profit motive is a necessary component of a functional economic system, its overemphasis poses a grave threat to the concept of professionalism

Despite the general acceptance of a ‘stakeholder model’ of governance replete with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) frameworks and Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access (IDEA) thinking, the modern world is still, primarily, structured around a seemingly unassailable principle of the pursuit of profit much in keeping with Milton Friedman’s assertion that “The business of business is business,” where he argued that a corporation’s sole social responsibility is to maximise profits for its shareholders while operating within the bounds of the law and basic societal ethics.

### ஜனாதிபதியின் தலைமையில்  Disrupt Asia 2025” பிரதான மாநாடு

*2025-09-19 05:52:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225468) · `ta`

இலங்கையில் முன்னணி புதிய தொழில்முனைவோர் மாநாடு மற்றும் புத்தாக்க விழாவான “Disrupt Asia 2025”  பிரதான மாநாடு வியாழக்கிழமை (18) கொழும்பில் உள்ள சினமன் லைஃப் ஹோட்டலில் நடைபெற்றது. இதன் ஆரம்ப நிகழ்வில் ஜனாதிபதி அநுர குமார திசாநாயக்க பிரதம அதிதியாகக் கலந்து கொண்டார்.

சுமார் 20 நாடுகளைச் சேர்ந்த வர்த்தகர்கள் மற்றும் முதலீட்டாளர்கள் பங்கேற்கும் Disrupt Asia 2025, புதன்கிழமை (17)  ஆரம்பமானதோடு செப்டம்பர் 20 வரை நடைபெறும்.

சர்வதேச கவனத்தை ஈர்ப்பதன் மூலம் தெற்காசியாவில் வளர்ந்து வரும் புத்தாக்க மையமாக இலங்கையை நிலைநிறுத்துவதே இந்த மாநாட்டின்  நோக்கமாகும். புதிய தொழில்முனைவு  மற்றும் புத்தாக்கங்களை ஊக்குவிப்பதன் மூலம் டிஜிட்டல் பொருளாதாரத்தை கட்டியெழுப்புவதற்கான அரசாங்கத்தின் திட்டத்திற்கு இது சிறந்த பக்கபலமாக இருக்கும்  என எதிர்பார்க்கப்படுகிறது.

இன்று நடைபெற்ற பிரதான மாநாட்டின் ஆரம்ப அமர்வில் கலந்து கொண்ட ஜனாதிபதி, புதிய தொழில்முனைவோர் கண்காட்சியையும் பார்வையிட்டார்.
