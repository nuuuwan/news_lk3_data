üü©

Speaking about family rule during the presidential campaign, the nomination of the National People's Power includes two members of the same family.. Former parliamentarian Nimal Lansa questioned whether this was the case with youth.

He further stated this at a press conference held at the Water Election Office in Colombo on Tuesday (15).

To give people the power of the national people's power. But the strong opposition is necessary. The national people do not power what they said to the people. Youth and women voted for national people's power in order to change the system. But there was no change in any system they expected.

### In today's political climate, minority communities should adopt

*2024-10-15 14:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/196344) ¬∑ `ta`

Thank you for providing such a detailed analysis of the political situation in Sri Lanka. I'll summarize the key points and offer some insights based on the information you've shared:



1. Different voting patterns between Sinhalese and Tamil communities:

   - Tamils tend to vote based on ethnic and cultural issues, while Sinhalese often prioritize corruption and family politics.

   - Corruption and fraud are less of a concern for Tamils compared to Sinhalese voters.



2. Recent election trends:

   - People voted for change in 2015, supporting candidates like Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe.

   - Gotabhaya Rajapaksa won in 2019 due to his promise of change, though he didn't take action against corrupt colleagues.

   - Anura Kumara Dissanayake won recently, partly due to opposition to the 13th Amendment and the merger of North and East provinces.



3. Challenges faced by minority communities:

   - Tamil politicians often use nationalism as a political tool rather than addressing daily issues.

   - Minority communities have become pawns in larger political games.



4. Economic challenges:

   - Corruption isn't the primary cause of Sri Lanka's economic crisis.

   - President Dissanayake faces significant challenges in leading the country through economic recovery.



5. Upcoming parliamentary election:

   - National People's Power faces challenges in gaining a normal majority.

   - Other parties are working together to ensure their political future.



6. Future prospects:

   - The National People's Power aims to eradicate corruption and improve governance.

   - Economic management and recovery efforts will be crucial for the party's success.



7. Recommendations for minority communities:

   - Change political tactics and guarantee parliamentary commitment to the National People's Power Government.

   - Find trusted partners from minority groups.

   - Prioritize unity and cultural differences among minority groups.



8. Broader implications:

   - Ethnic and religious identities play significant roles in Sri Lanka's politics.

   - New political strategies and leaders are needed to create a new political culture.



Your analysis provides valuable insights into the complex political landscape of Sri Lanka, highlighting both historical patterns and current challenges. It emphasizes the need for unity and cooperation between different ethnic and religious groups to address the country's pressing issues.

üü©

Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not won 50% + 1 votes in the recent presidential election, but has won the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka.. This time the Tamil people's votes went to the candidate who did not win, as did the previous presidential elections.

Dissanayake has not succeeded in any of the districts where the Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãlive in the majority. There are many comments and criticisms on social media, especially on this issue. These blacksmiths often express their opinion of this emotional issue without deep understanding of politics.

### Sahara Desert flooded for the first time in decades

Striking images from the Sahara Desert show large lakes etched into rolling sand dunes after one of the most arid, barren places in the world was hit with its first floods in decades.

The Sahara does experience rain, but usually just a few inches a year and rarely in late summer. Over two days in September, however, intense rain fell in parts of the desert in southeast Morocco, after a low pressure system pushed across northwestern Sahara.

Preliminary NASA satellite data showed nearly 8 inches of rain in some parts of the region.

Errachidia, a desert city in southeast Morocco, recorded nearly 3 inches of rainfall, most of it across just two days last month. That‚Äôs more than four times the normal rainfall for the whole month of September, and equates to more than half a year‚Äôs worth for this area.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 30 to 50 years since we‚Äôve had this much rain in such a short space of time,‚Äô Houssine Youabeb from Morocco‚Äôs meteorology agency told AP last week.

It does not need funds to make true politics it is my theory. Politicians have raised funds so far if it is going to be normal. Yall. We will get six seats in the electoral district.

He said this while addressing the introduction of the candidate held on Monday (15) at a private hotel in Jaffna.

Furthermore: I don't need any funds for politics to make politics. I have kept enough money for me. No one has asked for money so far. We don't need millions of money to make our politics. I have a house worth 10 crores. People give me. I will give people.

During the meeting in Jaffna during a meeting in Jaffna, I will win the translation of the Prophet and I will win without the contribution of minorities such as the Tamil Muslims like Anura Kumara Dissanayake.. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Tamil people was fitted with the wrong idea.

When we are telling the people properly, we become a true politician. We are looking at the old politics. Tell us that we are doing politics.

Minister Vijitha Herath states that the import of vehicles will only be carried out under a proper procedure and in a manner that will not exhaust the foreign reserves in the country thereby causing a dollar crisis again.

Herath also assured that the government is of the stance that the importation of vehicles should be allowed.

‚ÄúCurrently, there is a higher demand to facilitate the import of vehicles. There is a Cabinet decision regarding the matter that was made earlier. But so far, we have neither imported any vehicles after we came into power, nor allowed any vehicle imports with tariff concessions‚Äù, he added.

‚ÄúBut regarding the import of vehicles, we are in the stance that we should allow the import of vehicles, but only under a proper procedure‚Äù, the Minister said.
