    "A protest was held in front of the Labour Ministry demanding that the authorities allow the independent implementation of regulations passed by the legislature. The protest was held by the officials of the Labour Ministry, Labor Department and other government institutions. The protesters demanded creating a necessary environment to exercise the powers vested with government officials to independently implement rules and regulations enacted by the legislature and emphasising that those who implement them be protected legally.
