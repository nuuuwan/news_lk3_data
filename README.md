These benefits come at a significant cost to the Government, funded by public taxes,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

### Go for the low hanging fruit, Mr. President

You are now the hope of those seven million pleading for a better quality of life

Your opponents’ claim was that you lack experience in the top job, they are correct. You do not have the experience of bringing down an entire economy, you do not have the experience of corrupt practices or poor governance. However, you have been able to observe these taking place over the years and that should have given you lessons and insights to bring such practices to an end. So never fear to try the untested

As they say in the classics, it’s done and dusted. Your long cherished dream of leading your country has come to fruition. It has been a long struggle from your humble beginnings in the village of Tambuttegama to the Presidential Palace in Colombo. Yet you have not lost your humility and simple way of life and the kitchen staff at President’s House will need to change menus to village style rice and curry dishes instead of French cuisines including award winning wines.

Congratulations on your victory which not only belongs to you, but it is a very strong demonstration of how powerful the democratic process is here in Sri Lanka. Now the field is wide open for any underdogs to enter the race in the future. It was truly ground breaking in every possible way.

It was said that the just completed election was the most peaceful. Erik Solheim, former Norwegian Minister said, this election is a lesson for Western nations. Yet we all saw just a couple of days before the election US issued a travel advisory for its travellers. Just imagine that! People of this country completed the most peaceful election in the country ever had, yet US issued a travel advisory. Thankfully that advisory came in the last minute and the rest of the nations did not follow. Anyone dealing with travel advisories knows that they are contagious, when one country imposes them, other countries follow soon. As the saying goes “beggars can’t be choosers”, this is sadly our state.

### Here, and the road from here

*2024-10-02 00:08:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Here-and-the-road-from-here/4-767403) · `en`

The aftermath of the 2024 Presidential election was the most peaceful, ever. No fire-crackers, let alone gunshots or arson. An absence made possible by the NPP/JVP walking the talk. Given that public wrath at the political class played a decisive role in this election, a few incidents of over-the-top rejoicing might have been expected. But there were none. The election outcome amounted to a political upheaval, yet the country remained as calm as a goldfish bowl

Will President Dissanayake and his party be able to move beyond the restrictions imposed by their lingering primordial loyalties and appeal to non-Sinhala Lankans on a platform of genuine equality?

The Election Commission continues to rock. This week, it halted, for the duration of parliamentary polls, an order by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to increase fertiliser and fuel subsidies to farmers and fishermen.

The same way it stopped a multitude of giveaways by Ranil Wickremesinghe during Presidential elections.
