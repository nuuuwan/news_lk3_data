### UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban.

The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA.

The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group and demanding access throughout Gaza to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. Other opposing both resolutions included Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga.

While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly.

We are going to discuss with the Opposition MPs group. If that happens, the National People's Power MPs will vote during their conscience during the no -confidence motion. Remble

*2024-12-12 04:51:39* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Liberal-Youth-Movement-urges-Govt-inquiry-into-academic-qualification-concerns-of-Speaker/56-770394) ┬╖ `en`

The Liberal Youth Movement yesterday expressed its deep concern over allegations questioning the authenticity of the academic qualifications presented by Speaker Ashoka Ranwala prior to elections and during Parliamentary proceedings.

тАЬThese concerns have sparked significant public debate and raised serious doubts about the integrity of information shared by leaders with the electorate,тАЭ said the Liberal Youth MovementтАЩs Co-Convener Namini Panditha in a statement.

While academic qualifications are not mandatory for holding the position of a Member of Parliament or Speaker, such titles carry weight and are often used to influence voters and enhance political credibility. Misrepresentation of credentials undermines public trust and tarnishes the democratic process.

*2024-12-11 23:21:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/beat-the-heat/) ┬╖ `en`

Phew! ItтАЩs terribly hot when you venture out and your skin is at an exposed danger of the ultraviolet rays.

Yes, we canтАЩt stop ourselves from stepping out, but you can protect yourself from the harmful rays.

Application of fresh aloe vera gel to the skin helps to soothe and heal sunburn. Aloe vera contains zinc, which is actually anti-inflammatory.

Papaya pulp can be applied on the skin, like a maskтАжwashing it off after 20 minutes. Papaya contains enzymes and helps to remove dead skin cells. Add curd or lemon juice to the papaya pulp to remove tan. Fruits like banana, apple, papaya, orange can be mixed together and applied on the face. Keep it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Papaya helps to cleanse dead skin cells. Banana tightens the skin. Apple contains pectin and also tones the skin. Orange is rich in Vitamin C. It restores the normal acid-alkaline balance.
