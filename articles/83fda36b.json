    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is detaining BYD cars imported by the agent, and not third parties and other EV brands are also allowed to enter the country without tests, a statement after the latest court hearing said.",
    "Sri Lanka authorities are planning to test EVs after the dispute over motor power, where the same model are sold with different power output by manufacturers.",
    "\u201cCounsel for JKCG also drew the attention of Court to the fact that; Sri Lanka Customs is,  selectively, and in a discriminatory manner, detaining only BYD vehicles imported by JKCG, whilst it is permitting the clearance of other brands of electric vehicles imported by other entities, including BYD vehicles imported by others,\u201d the BYD agent in Sri Lanka said in a statement after the latest court hearing.",
    "\u201cIt was further stated that Sri Lanka Customs had not subject any other electric vehicles to independent testing, and that the details and information sought by Sri Lanka Customs, at various times, have already been provided on numerous occasions, even prior to the filing of the said Writ Application.",
    "\u201cIt was submitted that Sri Lanka Customs is the only Customs administration in the world that is refusing to accept the evidence provided by the manufacturer, BYD, which is known to be the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka Customs had originally detained 997 units of BYD or which 991 were ordered to be released by court on the strength of bank guarantee to cover additional taxes after the conclusion of tests.",
    "The BYD Atto 3 units were detained over a dispute involving motor output which are linked to taxes.",
    "BYD had declared a 100kW motor for the car, which is computer controlled to limit output, but there had been a complaint that the same physical motor that is in use in a 150kW model sold in markets like Japan was in the car.",
    "In Sri Lanka taxes are charged by kilowatt hours of the electric vehicle, which would attract a higher duty.",
    "At the latest court hearing on September 03, Sri Lanka Customs agreed to release 506 BYDs which were part of a second set of cars that were detained.",
    "Several other models of BYD were also detained in the second round.",
    "\u201cWhen the  Writ Application was taken up in the Court of Appeal on 3rd September 2025, Counsel for JKCG submitted that the other models of BYD vehicles presently detained by Sri Lanka Customs  are models that have not been previously imported on a commercial basis by any party, and that they have been detained without any reason, complaint or suspicion of any violation of law, whatsoever,\u201d the agent said.",
    "Meanwhile BYD said it was delivering cars that were originally ordered to be released by court to customers.",
    "\u201cSome of these vehicles have already been delivered to customers while the remainder are in the process of being delivered,\u201d the firm said.",
    "\u201cWe wish to confirm that the vehicles are being delivered at the original price they were offered to customers.\u201d",
    "September 3rd, 2025 \u2013 John Keells CG Auto (JKCG), wishes to update its customers and stakeholders on the ongoing legal proceedings in the Court of Appeal relating to some consignments of BYD vehicles being detained by Sri Lanka Customs.",
    "On 7th August 2025, in response to the Writ Application filed in the Court of Appeal, the Court ordered Sri Lanka Customs, and Sri Lanka Customs agreed to the immediate release of 991 of 997 BYD vehicles that were being detained by Sri Lanka Customs, on the security of a Bank Guarantee.",
    "Some of these vehicles have already been delivered to customers while the remainder are in the process of being delivered. We wish to confirm that the vehicles are being delivered at the original price they were offered to customers.",
    "Subsequent to 7th August, Sri Lanka Customs detained other consignments of BYD vehicles and refused to release even the models which were part of the initial Writ Application, on the same basis of provision of the security of a Bank Guarantee.",
    "However, upon submissions made on behalf of JKCG, on 3rd  September 2025, the Court of Appeal ordered the release of 506 BYD vehicles which are of the same models that were released under the Order of Court made in favour of JKCG on the same basis as \u2013 on 7th August 2025.",
    "When the  Writ Application was taken up in the Court of Appeal on 3rd September 2025, Counsel for JKCG submitted that the other models of BYD vehicles presently detained by Sri Lanka Customs  are models that have not been previously imported on a commercial basis by any party, and that they have been detained without any reason, complaint or suspicion of any violation of law, whatsoever.",
    "Counsel for JKCG also drew the attention of Court to the fact that; Sri Lanka Customs is,  selectively, and in a discriminatory manner, detaining only BYD vehicles imported by JKCG, whilst it is permitting the clearance of other brands of electric vehicles imported by other entities, including BYD vehicles imported by others. It was further stated that Sri Lanka Customs had not subject any other electric vehicles to independent testing, and that the details and information sought by Sri Lanka Customs, at various times, have already been provided on numerous occasions, even prior to the filing of the said Writ Application. It was submitted that Sri Lanka Customs is the only Customs administration in the world that is refusing to accept the evidence provided by the manufacturer, BYD, which is known to be the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world.",
    "We wish to clarify that the assertion that BYD electric vehicles are Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) where the performance can be fundamentally changed through software updates is technically incorrect. While software updates can enhance the digital experience and other aspects, the performance or output of the electric motor cannot be enhanced through any form of software update, which, BYD, as a globally reputed manufacturer, has confirmed.",
    "JKCG remains committed to collaborating closely with the relevant authorities to ensure the timely clearance of the vehicles and does not anticipate significant delays. As an authorized distributor for BYD, JKCG has extended its fullest cooperation to all relevant authorities, and has provided to Sri Lanka Customs, the manufacturer\u2019s specifications and compliance documentation which are accepted globally. We wish to reiterate our commitment to governance and complete transparency in which we have approached this matter from the inception.",
    "JKCG reiterates its mission of providing Sri Lankans with access to the highest quality New Energy Vehicles available in the global market, while supporting a rapid transition to sustainable mobility across the nation through the investment in charging infrastructure, expansion of the showroom network, after sales service and capacity building. We also believe that a fair and level playing field for all vehicle importers is essential to achieving this broader vision which will also support the country\u2019s goals of sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation solutions.",
    "We wish to thank our customers and stakeholders for their trust and understanding throughout this period while reassuring our customers that we will take all steps to hand over the vehicles as expeditiously as possible."
