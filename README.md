### Netanyahu to take the stand in his corruption trial for the first time

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks.

Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying.

Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves fell marginally to 6,462 million dollars by the end of November 2024, from 6,472 dollars a month earlier, central bank data shows.

Gross official reserves include balances of the Treasury. Reserves may go down due to debt repayment by the central bank or Treasury.

The central bank borrowed reserves including through swaps to target the policy rate with printed money in the past and has been settling them over the past year after buying dollars using deflationary policy with market rates.

In November the central bank bought 374 million US dollars from banks, data showed.

Concerns have been raised over recent cash injected through domestic operations (open market operations) at a time when money is already created over international operations, to closely target a policy rate with excess liquidity.

In order to maintain external stability, build reserves or repay debt compatible interest rates are needed to balance domestic credit.

Harnessing RE resources offers energy security and creates avenues for investment with skilled job opportunities opening for management, financial and technical specialists

Some of the factors that discourage investment flow and impede rapid development are the current sovereign credit risk ratings, state of the economy, risks associated with the principal sector player – the CEB, uncertainties associated with ongoing power sector reforms, cumbersome regulatory framework and seeming ineffectiveness of the regulator – PUCSL, expressions of environmental concern and geopolitics that influences project financing and development

I was an attendee at the International Conference on “Reimagining of the Electricity Industry for the Future” held on 28 November 2024 organised by the Sri Lanka branch of The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

At least 110 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti’s Cite Soleil slum when a gang leader targeted elderly people he suspected of causing his child’s illness through witchcraft, the National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) said on Sunday.

Wharf Jeremie gang leader Monel “Mikano” Felix ordered the massacre after his child became sick, RNDDH said, saying that he sought advice from a Voodoo priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft.

Gang members killed at least 60 people on Friday and 50 on Saturday using machetes and knives, it said.

Cite Soleil, a densely populated slum by the port of the capital Port-au-Prince, is among the poorest and most violent areas of Haiti.

Tight gang control, including the restriction of mobile phone use, has limited residents’ ability to share information about the massacre.

Felix, who heads the Wharf Jeremie gang, was in 2022 banned from entering neighboring Dominican Republic.
