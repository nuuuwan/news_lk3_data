    "Says SJB Party Leader Sajith Premadasa will once again contest from Colombo",
    "Stresses SJB has prepared strong team for elections under Premadasa\u2019s leadership",
    "Claims those who recently supported Ranil Wickremesinghe are now uniting with SJB",
    "Says SJB candidates are well known in contrast to candidates expected to contest from NPP",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Polonnaruwa District Leader and former MP Kins Nelson has revealed that the majority of senior members of the party are expected to enter Parliament through the national list in the upcoming Parliamentary elections. Nelson, the son of former UNP politician H.G.P. Nelson highlighted that General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara is among those likely to secure a seat via the national list.",
    "Speaking at a media briefing yesterday, Nelson also confirmed that Party Leader Sajith Premadasa would contest from the Colombo District once again. He further said that the SJB has prepared a strong team for the General Election under Premadasa\u2019s leadership, with nominations already being finalised.",
    "\u201cAll arrangements have been made, and we are ready to present a strong and capable team from both the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) to Parliament this year. We urge the entire country to support us in the Parliamentary elections scheduled for 14 November,\u201d Nelson stated.",
    "Nelson also pointed out that a large number of persons who had previously supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the last Presidential election are now uniting with the SJB. In addition, discussions are ongoing between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to join forces with the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS), excluding certain unpopular figures.",
    "He also commented on the National People\u2019s Party (NPP), noting that the party has yet to announce its candidates for the upcoming Parliamentary elections. \u201cThe people in rural areas are still unsure of who the JVP (NPP) will field, in contrast, our candidates are well-known and trusted by the public. We have a strong history of working closely with the people of this country,\u201d Nelson said.",
    "Nelson concluded by dismissing Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s team as a serious contender, stating that they are the same group that contributed to the country\u2019s economic downfall. \u201cThe United National Party\u2019s (UNP) support base is dwindling, and many of its members in the villages are now joining the SJB under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa,\u201d he added."
