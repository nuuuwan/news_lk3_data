    "\u201cDifferent surveys have shown around 30 percent of welfare benefits are received by people who don\u2019t qualify to receive [the welfare assistance], and the new survey is a transparent, non-politically influenced programme designed to provide additional benefits to the poor,\u201d the state minister said.",
