    "Sri Lanka\u2019s oceans are eight times larger than its landmass\u2014yet the nation continues to overlook its greatest asset. Graham Marshall, President of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), is urging policymakers and corporates to treat marine conservation with the same seriousness as terrestrial conservation.",
    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review recently after an exclusive screening of \u2018Ocean with Sir David Attenborough\u2019\u2014hosted by Spa Ceylon at SCOPE Cinema, Havelock City Mall\u2014Marshall echoed the famed naturalist\u2019s warning: \u201cWe are disturbed when a forest is degraded, but ignore that the same destruction is happening beneath the sea. The ocean is a forest too\u2014green, vibrant, and full of life. We are losing it at an alarming rate.\u201d",
    "For centuries, fishing was sustainable. Coastal communities lived in equilibrium with the sea\u2014catching fish while stocks naturally replenished. \u201cThat balance is broken, Marshall warned. \u201cIndustrial vessels scrape the seabed, destroying everything. Coastal families now come back with empty nets. Their livelihoods are being wiped out by large commercial fleets chasing profits.\u201d",
    "With less than three percent of world\u2019s seas protected, the stakes are high. \u201cWe are an island of 65,000 square kilometres, but with 550,000 square kilometres of ocean. Our food security, our economy, even our climate resilience depends on the seas. Yet we treat them as if they are expendable.\u201d",
    "Marshall stressed that the issue goes far beyond biodiversity. \u201cMangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs\u2014these are our frontline defences against climate change. They absorb more carbon than tropical rainforests. Protecting them is not just an environmental concern, it\u2019s an economic one. Conservation means more fish, more livelihoods and more stability for coastal communities. Destroying these ecosystems is like destroying our own economy.\u201d",
    "He warned that unchecked exploitation is \u201cshooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d By chasing short-term gains, Sri Lanka risks losing the long-term value of its blue economy\u2014an asset that could rival its traditional industries if managed sustainably.",
    "Marshall highlighted that WNPS has already shifted gears to give oceans the attention they deserve. \u201cWe now have a very active marine committee, with brilliant scientists like Dr. Malik Fernando, Dr. Rex de Silva, and generations of divers who know these seas. We are building on the work of pioneers such as Arthur C. Clarke.\u201d",
    "Current efforts include mangrove and seagrass conservation, promoting marine protected areas and community-based resource management. But Marshall stressed that more needs to be done. \u201cWe must address destructive commercial fishing practices. We must empower coastal communities. And corporates must step up\u2014marine conservation should be at the heart of sustainability agendas.\u201d",
    "Marshall\u2019s message is clear: Sri Lanka\u2019s oceans are not a luxury\u2014they are the foundation of its survival and prosperity. \u201cAs an island nation, our seas are our borders, our livelihoods, and our protection. If we continue destroying them, we risk not just biodiversity, but our economic future. If we protect them, we protect our people.\u201d",
