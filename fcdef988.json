    "A 10,000 person survey by LirneAsia, a regional policy research organization, found that 33 percent of the respondents had skipped a meal and 47 percent reduced their meal sizes, after the currency crisis.",
    "About 27 percent of adults restricted their meals to feed children. The survey was conducted from October 10, 2022 to May 12, 2023.",
    "Sri Lanka started an output gap targeting exercise (Keynesian stimulus) printing large volumes of money and a so-called flexible exchange rate backed by inconsistent policy collapsed in 2022 from 200 to 360 to the US dollar, tearing apart the monetary foundations of families, destroying real salaries and jobs.",
    "Food prices soared partly due to a global commodity bubble fired by the Federal Reserve and also import restrictions from forex shortages and disruption to agriculture from a fertilizer ban.",

    "The Great Depression was a \u2018deflationary collapse\u2019 during the 1930s came in the wake of the Federal Reserve firing the \u2018roaring 20s bubble\u2019 after accidentally inventing the policy rate giving power to economists to mis-target interest rates, analysts have said.",
    "Sri Lanka at the time however did not have a central bank to trigger a currency collapse. Food prices fell steeply during the Great depression. In a central bank currency crisis, the worst hit are wage earners whose salaries do not go up as prices rise with a collapse of the value of domestic money.",
    "From March 2023, Sri Lanka central bank has appreciated the currency with deflationary policy, allowing food prices to fall.",
    "In Sri Lanka poverty among Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation worker families was already high at 31 percent by 2019, based on a household income and expenditure survey (HIES 2019) of the state statistics office.",

    "Sri Lanka has a number of government income support programs, chief among them known as Samurdhi.",
    "The survey found that 1.7 million families got Samurdhi benefits but only 40 percent were poor or below the official poverty line Gayani Hurrulle, Senior Research Manager at LirneAsia said.",
    "About 4 percent were in the richest income decile, 5 percent were in the next.",
    "Only 17 percent who were on Samurdhi benefits have exited the program. Opaque criteria including attending political meetings were used by Samurdhi officials to admit new applicants, respondents to the survey had said.",
    "Sri Lanka is now starting a new program called Aswesuma which will consolidate existing schemes including Samurdhi, an old age benefit scheme and kidney patient\u2019s support.",
