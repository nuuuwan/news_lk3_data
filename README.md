It costs 25 million rupees to get a candidate's name on the ballot. There are 27 candidates so far. If so, let's find out how much money it costs. This is a waste of people's money.

### No one can build the PA;Ranil's success is the country's victory - Wimalaweera Dissanayake

*2024-08-11 23:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190845) · `ta`

Wimalaweera Dissanayake supports Ranil Wickremesinghe for the upcoming election, emphasizing his leadership during the economic crisis. She highlights Ranil's selfless dedication to the nation over his political future. Despite challenges, including the unfeasibility of building a united front, she advocates for Ranil's victory as crucial for the country's recovery.

🟩

No one can build the Sri Lanka PA. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the upcoming election.

While the country was opposed to the worst economic crisis, none of the heroes who are currently speaking of the government have been responsible for the government. The country was on fire. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the country without considering his political future.

The ruling and opposition parties must remember that no one can do election campaigns if the Age of 20122 is present in the year 20122.

I will be happy if the PA wins, but it is impossible to practice. No one can build public Peramuna. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the election. If he wins, the country will win.

The firm structure for recovering from the economic crisis has now been implemented.

### Presidential hopefuls should give top priority to make Sri Lanka a creative economy – Part I

A nation desirous of surviving and prospering should necessarily embrace ‘innovation and creativity’

The innovation inputs consist of five broad categories, namely, institutional structure, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication and business sophistication. In innovation outputs, there are two categories, namely, knowledge and technology and creativity. In all these categories, Sri Lanka’s performance as an innovative economy has been far from the desired. It also opens a wide policy corridor for Sri Lanka Government to adopt for implementation if it is really interested in building its knowledge base and its application in business

### Presidential Hopefuls Should Give Top Priority To Make Sri Lanka A Creative Economy – Part I

There is a long list of Presidential hopefuls, but the voters will focus on five or six of them. From among them, one will be elected as the leader to steer the country to progress and prosperity. However, if they are to deliver prosperity to people, they should adopt policy strategies to accelerate economic growth at an unparalleled level of 8-9% annually over the next 25 years. This requires Sri Lanka to generate new inventions which should be commercially produced for the local as well as for global markets through innovations.

Hence, inventions and innovations should receive the highest priority of those aspiring to win the forthcoming Presidential election in their policy strategies. This article series will provide the needed guidance to those Presidential hopefuls. It is an updated and a modified version of a previous paper written by the author for the Association of Professional Bankers.

Modern economies should be aptly termed innovation or creative economies

Youth not only represent the future of our nations but are one of society’s main agents of change and progress for any country. As stated by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, “Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires a seismic shift – which can only happen if we empower young people and work with them as equals.”

In 1999, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the recommendation by the World Conference of Ministers of Youth (Lisbon, 8-12 August 1998) that 12 August be declared International Youth Day.

### The Reality Of The Economic Crisis

*2024-08-11 21:52:19* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-reality-of-the-economic-crisis/) · `en`

There is still a significant misunderstanding among many people regarding the true cause of the economic crisis. While many attribute the economic downturn primarily to corruption, the underlying cause is far more complex: we have been spending more than we earn. The lack of savings, combined with many state institutions operating at a loss, has led us to spend beyond our means. To cover these expenses, we have had to borrow money, and as this pattern continued, our debt accumulated to unmanageable levels. When income suddenly drops, the ability to pay off these debts becomes severely compromised, leading to the kind of crisis Sri Lanka experienced in 2021.

History shows that only the main candidates receive significant support, with others struggling to secure even 2% of the vote. The deadline for controlling the upcoming presidential election is the 14th, with 27 individuals already registered.

In the presidential election, some people are seen as a candidate for various personal reasons. We see this as a move to abuse the country's democracy and independence.. We think the number of candidates will increase further in the coming days.

Thus, some of those who come forward to contest the election have to avoid those who come forward for their own reasons. Others come to the foreign ambassador services or the winning candidate from the winning candidate, in order to obtain the positions of the Head of State Department, to get the free media opportunity, or to appoint their representatives in the polls, to win the election for other reasons for other reasons.
