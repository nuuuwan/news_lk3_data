    "Maddrey commended the officers, a 28-year veteran a 16-year veteran.",
    "\u201cThey could have easily let this person walk past them with his luggage. Instead, they stopped, asked a couple of questions, tried to get some intel before they walked right up in there,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, they were met with the perpetrator in this incident. He went right at them.\u201d",

    "An 11-year-old girl found in front of the house died from her injuries, police said.",
    "A fire in the living room and foyer area left police unable to enter the home initially, but fire officials were quickly able to put out the fire. The suspect likely lit a couch on fire on his way out of the home, police said.",
    "After putting out the fire, officials found three people dead inside the home: a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s. Police believe all four died of stab wounds, Maddrey said.",
    "A 61-year-old female is at Mt. Sinai Hospital in critical condition, according to Joseph Kenny, NYPD Chief of Detectives.",
    "The stabbing suspect has been identified as a 38-year-old Bronx resident, Kenny said during the news conference. He has one prior arrest for a strangulation domestic violence incident in the Bronx, Kenny said.",
    "Kenny said the incident seems to be family related, though police are still investigating. The 911 caller is being interviewed, police said.",
