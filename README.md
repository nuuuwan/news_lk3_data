The 55-year-old Dissanayake has demonstrated integrity and political savvy throughout the 10 years since he was elected leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. He has distinguished himself from other party leaders by being extraordinarily wary of power for power’s sake, and for taking politically courageous decisions that were in the country’s best interests, while being to his or his party’s political detriment. Much of Dissanayake’s appeal to voters comes from his ability to remain down-to-earth, even as he has transformed into a political phenomenon virtually overnight

### Fed up of racist politics, corruption, and mismanagement

Shortsighted and destructive racist politics aimed at gaining or retaining power, not realising the overall damage to the country since independence in 1948, brought Marxist National People Party (NPP) President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power in the Presidential elections held on Saturday 21 September 2024.

The message is very clear. Clean up politics, bring those who plundered the country to book and unite divided communities to move ahead for a better future for all.

It all started since independence in 1948 from British rule when the country was blessed with all required ingredients to move ahead to ensure a better future for all. The island had political and economic stability, literate people, honesty and integrity at all levels and on top of all communal harmony. All what was required then was a leader from the Sinhalese community who could keep the communities together and jointly move ahead for the overall development for the betterment of all communities in the country.

### Comrade President: Dimensions of AKD’s victory and Sajith’s defeat

Neither Anura nor Sajith led the Aragalaya or seized the 2022 moment that Ranil did, but it was Anura and his comrades who grasped the post-Aragalaya moment of the debt-crisis and Ranil-IMF austerity, while Sajith and the SJB failed to due to ideological ambiguity regarding Ranil’s economic doctrine and ambivalence about their role vis-à-vis Ranil

Time will tell what kind of statesman he makes, but one must salute Anura Dissanayake’s evolution into a brilliant politician and political leader. In August 2020 he had 3 seats and 3% of the vote, and a mere four years later, was sworn in as President with 42% of the vote.

The arithmetic clearly tells us that it was Ranil Wickremesinghe’s ‘dog-in-the-manger’ spoiler candidacy that defeated Sajith Premadasa and ensured Anura’s victory, but when AKD set out on this project with victory in his sights two (he says) or four years ago, not only was it an impossible dream but Wickremesinghe was out of the picture.

Pledges by Sri Lanka’s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to cut taxes and make changes to the country’s International Monetary Fund bailout could keep the country’s credit risks elevated for some time, rating agency Moody’s has said.

“We do not expect significant disruption to the country’s reform agenda or macroeconomic policies, which include the ongoing debt restructuring and structural adjustments under its programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),” Moody’s said,

“However, some policies are likely to be reprioritised amid challenges in maintaining fiscal consolidation that could keep credit risks elevated for some time.”

Since its default in 2022, Sri Lanka has implemented various steps to restore fiscal sustainability, such as raising VAT and corporate tax rates and lowering personal tax-free allowances.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological condition characterised by social interaction difficulties, restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Although the exact mechanisms behind its development remain largely unknown, recent research has highlighted the connection between the gut microbiome and ASD. The emerging field of research into the “gut-brain axis” has revealed that microbial imbalances in the gut can affect brain function, potentially contributing to the onset and progression of ASD. This article explores the relationship between the gut microbiome and ASD as well as the potential clinical applications of microbiome-based therapies for alleviating symptoms associated with the disorder.
