  "original_body_lines": [
    "Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy defiantly declared Saturday that his countrymen \u201cwill not give their land to occupiers,\u201d after President Donald Trump suggested that a peace deal would include some \u201cswapping\u201d of territories with Russia.",
    "\u201cThe answer to Ukraine\u2019s territorial question is already in the constitution of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a message on Telegram early Saturday. \u201cNo one will and no one can deviate from it. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
    "His comments came after Trump announced on Truth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been scheduled for next week in Alaska.",
    "Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.",
    "Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \u201cswapping\u201d territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we\u2019ll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\u201d",
    "A White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.",
    "But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \u201cdecisions against peace,\u201d adding, \u201cThey will not achieve anything.\u201d"
