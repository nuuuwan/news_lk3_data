    "Heritance Hotels and Resorts, the flagship brand of Aitken Spence Hotels, and Aitken Spence Travels have announced their partnership for the upcoming Bikeathon, organised by the CCC Foundation to raise national awareness for mental health and promote the lifesaving 1333 Mental Health Helpline.",
    "The 1333 Bikeathon charts a powerful journey across Sri Lanka, from southern coastlines to the heartland, blending purpose with discovery. Along this route, participants will find exclusive accommodation at Heritance Hotels and Resorts and Aitken Spence Hotels, including Heritance Ahungalla, Heritance Kandalama, Sentido Heritance Negombo, and Amethyst Resort Passikudah.",
    "This partnership signals a brand-wide commitment to social responsibility, supporting a cause that affects communities across Sri Lanka. At a time when mental wellness is an increasingly vital conversation, particularly among youth, Heritance Hotels and Resorts and Aitken Spence Travels are proud to stand with the CCC Foundation in amplifying the visibility of the 1333 Hotline as a critical helpline for those in need.",
    "Aitken Spence PLC Chairperson Stasshani Jayawardena said: \u201cAt the heart of hospitality lies a profound commitment to people\u2014not just those we welcome through our doors, but the communities that we serve and the lives that we touch. Our partnership with the CCC Foundation and our support of the 1333 Bikeathon underscore our belief that social responsibility is not optional; it\u2019s essential. Mental health is a deeply human issue, one that transcends boundaries and affects every family, every neighbourhood, and every nation. As an industry rooted in human connection, we recognise our duty to lead with empathy, to raise awareness, and to champion meaningful change for the people that we endeavour to serve.\u201d",
    "In extending this commitment, Heritance Hotels and Resorts and Aitken Spence Travels recognise the profound role travel can play in restoring the mind and uplifting the spirit. Purposeful journeys like the 1333 Bikeathon offer more than physical movement\u2014they create space for reflection, healing, and connection.",
    "As the route winds through Sri Lanka\u2019s coastlines, lush interiors, and rural heartlands, Heritance Hotels and Resorts and Aitken Spence Travels will document the experience through a visual storytelling series that not only showcases the island\u2019s natural beauty but reinforces the importance of mental wellness as a shared national priority."
