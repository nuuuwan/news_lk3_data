The capital, New Delhi, which is among India‚Äôs worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali.

### Anurakumara Dissanayake and the creation of the national people's power

*2024-10-31 13:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197579) ¬∑ `ta`

Based on the detailed historical and political analysis provided, here are the key points regarding the JVP and its evolution:



1. The JVP initially pursued revolutionary violence but shifted towards democratic methods after the armed conflicts in 1971 and 1988-90.



2. In the 2015 parliamentary election, the JVP received 543,944 votes (4.8%) and won six seats.



3. The party contested alone in 2015 instead of joining an opposition coalition.



4. In the 2018 local government elections, the JVP received 693,875 votes (6.27%) but failed to capture any councils.



5. The JVP formed the National People's Power alliance in 2019, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.



6. In the 2019 presidential election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake received 418,563 votes (3.15%) as the National People's Power candidate.



7. In the 2020 parliamentary election, the National People's Power received 445,958 votes (3.84%), winning three seats.



8. Despite efforts to increase its vote bank, the JVP has struggled to overcome its status as the third political power in Sri Lanka.



9. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been instrumental in changing the electoral strategy and enriching his political image within the party.



10. The JVP continues to maintain its independence and does not want to form coalitions or alliances with other parties, preferring to lead as an equal partner.



The analysis suggests that while the JVP has made some progress in recent years, it still faces challenges in increasing its vote share and electoral performance compared to the major political parties in Sri Lanka.

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe stresses that the privileges granted to former Presidents of the country should remain intact.

Speaking at a rally in Matale, Wickremesinghe emphasized that he does not require any privileges for himself and that the government must prioritize the safety of other former presidents.

Addressing the rally, he remarked, ‚ÄúPresidential residences are being removed. I don‚Äôt have a problem. I don‚Äôt live in a residence. It‚Äôs not a problem for me. Why are they chasing behind Chandrika? Just let her be in that house. I have nothing special, but for humanity‚Ä¶ If Mahinda Rajapaksa requires security for himself‚Ä¶he is the one who ended the war, think about it‚Ä¶‚Äù

He further stated that if there are genuine security concerns, those should be addressed to anyone in need.
