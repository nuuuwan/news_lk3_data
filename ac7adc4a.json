    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged tourism industry stakeholders to aim higher from its current target of five million tourists, inviting them to set their sights on 7.5 million arrivals including higher-paying tourists.",
    "Speaking at the 58th Annual General Meeting of The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), Wickremesinghe said on Monday November 27 that there is a need to move beyond the existing framework and embrace competition to elevate Sri Lanka\u2019s standing in the global tourism market.",
    "A statement from the president\u2019s office said Wickremesinghe had questioned why countries like Vietnam get more tourists despite being in the industry for a shorter period. Increasing the number of tourists to 2.5 million in the upcoming year and subsequently expanding on this figure is important, he said.",
    "\u201cWhen I took over the government, I realised that sustainability alone is not sufficient. How are we going to earn foreign exchange? How are we going to have a positive balance of trade? In that, there were many suggestions. But what is the low-hanging fruit? And one of the low-hanging fruits was tourism. Let\u2019s promote tourism fully,\u201d Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying.",
    "The president also highlighted the importance of maximising earnings and attracting tourists from both domestic and international markets without unnecessary restrictions.",
    "Calling for the \u201cenhancement of the tourism product\u201d and a \u201cnuanced approach to promotion\u201d that go back to the \u201cearly roots of tourism\u201d in Sri Lanka\u2019s ancient Anuradhapura kingdom, he urged industry to specialise, tapping into the unexplored potential that Sri Lanka possesses.",
    "\u201cLook at our food. From one area to another. Have you utilised it? Let\u2019s do that. We have to be special in many ways. You remember, tourism was not something that was new to us. It was there even in the time of the Anuradhapura period,\u201d President Wickremesinghe remarked.",
    "A comprehensive experience \u2013 encompassing accommodation, cuisine, and cultural offerings was among the suggestions made by the president in his speech to attract and retain tourists. He also called for the diversification and improvement of Sri Lankan cuisine, with a focus on a fusion of local and international flavours to cater to diverse tastes.",
    "Noting the potential for collaboration with expatriates to further enhance the industry, Wickcremesinghe said Sri Lanka can tap into the potential of niche markets in a bid to mimic the success of boutique hotels initiated around 2003-2004.",
    "The president also highlighted plans for the transformation of Colombo into an entertainment hub, calling for diverse activities to keep visitors engaged, in addition to developing tourism infrastructure.",
    "\u201cWhat do we do there? Very little. You go to a museum, it\u2019s a short run. You go to Gangaramaya Temple. You look at the Independence Square and back. So what are we planning? It should be an area of entertainment or music or food. All the way up to the Independence Square, it will be a new area,\u201d he said.",
    "The development of the Bogambara prison in Kandy into a hotel and a hotel school was also discussed by Wickremesinghe which he said showcases his government\u2019s commitment ot utilising available resources for tourism. He urged stakeholders to contribute ideas and support to implement these \u201ctransformative initiatives\u201d.",
    "On the issue of minimum rates, Wickremesinghe called for a shift towards higher rates, highlighting the need for a quality product that justifies the cost. The statement said he \u201cencouraged the industry to think beyond conventional constraints and embrace a new mindset for achieving the ambitious target of 5 million tourists\u201d.",
    "\u201cIn this new era, we need new thinking. We can\u2019t get there with the old mindset. Just forget it and put it aside. Think of the new people who will come. Then we can achieve our five million,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Nov28/2023)"
