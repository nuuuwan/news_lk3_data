    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s ministry of industries wants to ensure commercially-ready products and services are produced by university research, by facilitating partnerships with factories and entrepreneurs.",
    "After a currency crisis, Sri Lanka\u2019s government is in a drive to boost its trade balance by increasing exports.",
    "\u201cOur export basket hasn\u2019t changed recently, partly because our small and medium entrepreneurs don\u2019t have sufficient research and development facilities (like the multinationals) to innovate their products for the export market,\u201d Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Industries, Chaminda Pathiraja said.",
    "\u201cAt the same time, state universities and research institutes produce a large amount of research findings yearly, which end up sitting in those institutions; they don\u2019t reach the industry,\u201d Pathiraja said at a press briefing to announce a program on commercialization of new products and research, to be held tomorrow at the Waters Edge.",
    "The networking forum will bring innovators and manufacturers together to focus on the commercialization of research for the value added tea, coir, spice, dairy products, gem and jewellery and packaging products industries.",
    "\u201cWe want to encourage collaboration, through programs like our University Business League etc, so that the research output can be commercialized, and what is produced by our factories can increase in quantity and quality. We must focus on the export market.\u201d",
    "The objective of this program, he said, was to reduce the gap in acquiring innovators\u2019 ideas and skills by the investors, and ultimately boost the manufacturing sector\u2019s efficiency in alignment with the export market."
