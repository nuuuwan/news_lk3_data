  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court has postponed a petition filed by State Minister Diana Gamage seeking an order for the dismissal of a decision taken by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to scrap her membership in the party.",
    "The relevant petition was scheduled to be heard before the three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Samayawardena today (10), but the judge bench decided to postpone the hearing since Justice Wickremesinghe was reportedly unwell.",
    "Accordingly, the petition was ordered to be recalled on February 09, 2024.",
    "The SJB had earlier decided to expel National List MP Gamage from the party citing that she had failed to comply with the unanimous decision taken by the SJB to vote against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, by voting it in favour. The party had also highlighted that this was a serious violation of party discipline, and that the Opposition Leader and the SJB\u2019s Chairman Sajith Premadasa decided to suspend her party membership for the reputation or well-being and prosperity of the party."
