In Washington, President Joe Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down “nearly all” the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response.

Condemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France saying Iran “is risking a potential military escalation,” Britain calling the attack “reckless” and Germany saying Iran and its proxies “must stop it immediately.”

Colombo, April 13 (Daily Mirror) -As the Sinhala and Tamil festive season approaches, environmentalists in Sri Lanka have sounded the alarm on the detrimental impact of fireworks on pets and wildlife.

According to Environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella, research indicates that fireworks not only disturb the peace of humans but also have profound effects on wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, including dogs and cats.

The loud explosions can cause birds to abandon their nests in fear, disrupting their habitats.

According to studies, animals have a far more acute sense of hearing than humans, making them particularly sensitive to the deafening blasts of fireworks.

With explosions reaching up to 190 decibels—far surpassing the threshold for human hearing damage at 75 decibels—the sound can induce anxiety, confusion and panic in animals.

Furthermore, researches suggest that up to 50 percent of dogs experience fear or anxiety during fireworks displays.

US President Joe Biden says he expects Iran to attack Israel “sooner than later”, as fears grow of Iranian retaliation over an air strike that killed top commanders early this month.

Israel has not admitted attacking an Iranian consulate in Syria but is widely believed to have been behind it.

US officials have told CBS News, the BBC’s US partner, that a major attack on Israel could happen imminently.

Israel says it is ready to defend itself. Mr Biden told Iran: “Don’t.”

“We are devoted to the defence of Israel. We will support Israel,” Mr Biden said. “We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed.”

Iran backs Hamas, the Palestinian group fighting Israel in Gaza, as well as various proxy groups throughout the region, including some - such as Hezbollah in Lebanon - that frequently carry out strikes against the Israelis.
