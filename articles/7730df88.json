    "The Commercial High Court of Colombo recently issued an order restraining Nimal Kularatne, Kelum Kularatne and a few others from exercising any rights as Directors of Movie Producers and Importers Company Ltd., also known as \u2018MPI Film Circuit\u2019 by order dated 13 November 2024 issued in Case No. HC Civil 78/2024 (CO).",
    "N. Udayakumar and Dr. Arosha Fernando have been nominated as the new Joint Managing Directors of the Film Circuit by the Board of Directors moving forward. There are only five film circuits who have the authority to release local and foreign films in Sri Lanka \u2013 MPI Film Circuit, EAP Film Circuit, CEL Film Circuit, LFD Film Circuit which are owned by the private sector, and Rithma Film Circuit owned by the Government under the National Film Corporation.",
    "The Sri Lankan film industry is a fledgling industry that has struggled to find a footing since its inauguration in 1947, and in the recent past MPI Film Circuit has become a truly strong company managing and operating a series of modern cinemas under the Circuit and has released a number of highly successful movies giving a new energy to the entire industry."
