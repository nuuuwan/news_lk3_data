    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s forex reserves rose 221 million dollars to 5,642 million US dollars in June 2024 from a month earlier.",
    "In June the International Monetary Fund approved a review making available about 336 million dollars to Sri Lanka.",
    "There has been some volatility in the exchange rate in after earlier excess liquidity from dollar purchases.",
    "Sri Lanka operates a so-called flexible exchange rate, which is neither a clean float nor a hard peg and has anchor conflicts.",
    "Sri Lanka has a foreign reserve target set by the International Monetary Fund which requires reserve collection (a type of strong side pegging which has the same effect as a surrender rule on the exchange rate), but intervention in the other direction (weak side) is discouraged.",
    "Interest rates are also decided not on the reserve target and domestic credit but on an inflation target (essentially a real interest rate argument), leading to depreciation, social unrest, loss of confidence when private credit recovers from an earlier crisis. (Colombo/July05/2024)"
