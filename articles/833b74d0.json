  "original_title": "From warning to wake-up call: Elephants  now drive 40% of Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism economy",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "In November 2020, we argued in this paper that \u201ca cut tree, a dead elephant, is a lost tourism dollar in the future.\u201d At the time, we estimated the lifetime value of a wild elephant at $ 11 million and warned that deforestation, human-elephant conflict, and short-sighted planning were dismantling the very assets Sri Lanka most needed to attract high-value travellers.",
    "Five years later, the future has arrived and with startling clarity. Elephants are no longer a peripheral tourism attraction. They are the central economic engine of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign exchange earnings.",
    "If the past decade has taught Sri Lanka one lesson, it is that tourism is the fastest way out of crisis.",
    "In 2018, the industry generated $ 5.6 billion from 2.5 million visitors, briefly standing as the nation\u2019s top foreign exchange earner. The 2019 Easter Sunday attacks cut earnings to $ 3.6 billion, and by 2022, the economic collapse had almost paralysed the sector.",
    "Yet tourism rebounded with extraordinary speed. In 2024, arrivals climbed to 2.05 million and receipts to $ 3.17 billion, outpacing remittances, exports, and FDI in growth. In the first eight months alone, tourism brought in $ 2.2 billion, a 66% year-on-year increase.",
    "This resilience underscores a critical truth: while exports, remittances, and FDI require years of structural reform, tourism has proven it can rebound quickly and inject immediate foreign exchange. And at the centre of this turnaround lies Sri Lanka\u2019s greatest comparative advantage \u2013 its elephants.",
    "In 2024, 851,365 foreign visitors (nearly 41% of arrivals) came specifically to see elephants-focused national parks and forests. They generated $ 1.31 billion, or 40% of total tourism receipts.",
    "That makes elephants alone as valuable as Sri Lanka\u2019s tea exports, long considered the backbone of the economy. Put differently, 7,500 wild elephants are now generating the same foreign exchange as an entire tea plantation industry.",
    "This shift is profound: elephants have become a GDP-scale economic asset.",
    "Export vulnerability: When the Rose Garden sneezes, Colombo catches a cold",
    "In 2024, goods exports totalled $ 12.77 billion, with the garment sector contributing $ 4.8 billion. But nearly 40% of garment exports go to the US, leaving the industry hostage to American trade policy.",
    "In April 2025, the White House announced sweeping tariffs from the Rose Garden, initially at 44% and subsequently revised to 20%. Even at this lower rate, the damage was clear: a single announcement put 300,000 jobs and $ 2 billion in forex earnings at risk.",
    "This is the peril of dependence. Our export strategy is overly reliant on a single market and vulnerable to political decisions beyond our control.",
    "The limits of remittances and FDI: Labour flows outward, capital slows inward",
    "For decades, remittances underpinned Sri Lanka\u2019s external account. In 2024, inflows rose 10% to $ 6.57 billion. Yet the composition is troubling: most comes from unskilled labour in the Middle East, which caps per-worker earning power.",
    "In contrast, India and the Philippines export skilled professionals in IT, healthcare, and engineering \u2014 earning three to four times more per worker. Without a shift toward skills-based migration, Sri Lanka has become locked into low-value remittance markets that deliver volume but little resilience.",
    "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been even weaker. Between 2015 and 2019, inflows averaged just $ 1.2 billion annually, growing at less than 1% per year. Post-crisis, inflows improved slightly, recording a 2020\u20132023 CAGR of ~13%. But even this recovery pales in comparison to regional peers. Structural bottlenecks \u2013 which includes policy uncertainty, infrastructure gaps, and failure to integrate into global supply chains \u2014 continue to deter large-scale investment. While Vietnam has become a hub for electronics and Thailand for automobiles, Sri Lanka remains on the sidelines, awaiting a breakthrough that never comes.",
    "Both remittances and FDI bring foreign exchange, but neither delivers resilience or rapid scale. Unlike tourism, which proves it can rebound quickly and expand fast, these flows remain slow-moving and structurally constrained.",
    "Elephants, by contrast, are immune to tariffs, sanctions, or supply chain shocks. Their value is intrinsic, rooted in our ecosystems yet demanded globally.",
    "In 2024, elephant-focused tourism earned $ 1.31 billion, nearly as much as tea, and a third of apparel exports. Unlike garments, where Sri Lanka competes against Vietnam and Bangladesh on cost, no other country can replicate Minneriya\u2019s Gathering or Udawalawe\u2019s wild herds.",
    "Elephants are not just an advantage. They are Sri Lanka\u2019s right to win in the global tourism economy.",
    "A single elephant generates $ 175,000 annually in tourism receipts",
    "With 7,500 elephants, the national herd is worth $ 78\u201380 billion \u2014 almost equal to Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP of $ 84 billion in 2024",
    "Every elephant lost to human-elephant conflict or poaching erases $ 10.5 million from the country\u2019s future forex balance sheet.",
    "What makes this even more striking is efficiency. Tea plantations require hundreds of thousands of workers and vast amounts of capital employed. Elephants generate equal forex simply by existing in their natural habitats.",
    "The employment footprint is equally transformative. In 2024, elephant-related tourism sustained nearly 200,000 jobs across hotels, safari jeeps, guides, restaurants, handicrafts, and cultural suppliers.",
    "Each elephant tourist supports five to six rural jobs. For villages with few economic alternatives, elephants are not a nuisance. They are the single largest rural employer.",
    "Protecting elephants, therefore, is the most effective means to rural development and poverty alleviation.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s elephants must be managed as a national economic asset. Four policy imperatives stand out:",
    "Reframe elephants as capital \u2014 integrate them into economic and development strategy, rather than just conservation policy",
    "Protect habitats as infrastructure \u2014 treat forests and wildlife corridors as GDP-scale capital zones that generate forex",
    "Community-based conservation \u2014 ensure rural households directly benefit from elephant tourism, reducing conflict and aligning incentives",
    "Global positioning \u2014 brand Sri Lanka as the \u201cElephant Capital of Asia\u201d, a unique, differentiated, and irreplaceable eco-tourism identity",
    "In 2020, we warned in this paper that Sri Lanka had \u201cnever missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\u201d Five years later, the evidence is overwhelming:",
    "Tourism \u2014 powered by elephants \u2014 is the only forex source delivering resilience, scale, and jobs",
    "Our elephants are worth $ 80 billion. They sustain 200,000 livelihoods. They generate as much forex as tea without the capital and labour burden.",
    "A dead elephant is a tragedy of nature. It is the destruction of a $ 10.5 million national asset and a direct blow to Sri Lanka\u2019s future.",
    "Protecting elephants is a matter of economic survival, national security, and our most unassailable right to win."
