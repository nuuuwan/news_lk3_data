    "Under a new agreement between the Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Ltd., and PickMe, the app based ride hailing company will operate a taxi stand within the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).\u00a0 The new arrangement will bring an additional revenue of Rs. 700/- per vehicle to the BIA while making it easier to monitor tourist arrivals.",
    "\u201cWe will be generating a daily report to the airport and keeping authorities updated on our vehicle movements.\u00a0 Apart from the BIA, this will also help the tourism industry to gauge arrivals and departures of free individual travellers (FITs) which will help the industry to understand their stays and travel patterns within the island.\u00a0 From the user point of view i.e. foreign tourists, they will have access to a transparent system that will allow them to travel from the BIA to any part of the country at a very reasonable cost.\u00a0 PickMe is already popular amongst video bloggers who travel all over the country, giving useful data to travellers across the world.",
    "They have already highlighted that PickMe rates are less than half of what other taxi services stationed at the BIA offers,\u201d says Zulfer Jiffry, CEO of PickMe, adding that the company looks forward to working with the airport to increase and improve Customer Experiences at the airport.",
    "All Airport trips will have PickMe\u2019s Insurance cover for hospitalisation and Life.\u00a0 The company also has the additional advantage of ride tracking on their app, which enables loved ones to easily see their movements even when overseas.\u00a0 This not only increases the safety factor, but also ensures peace of mind for tourists and their families.",
