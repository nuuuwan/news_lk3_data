    "Justice Sotomayor on SC Ruling on Presidential Immunity: With fear for our democracy, I dissent",
    "President Biden had a dismal debate night on Thursday, June 28. There is absolutely no gainsaying that fact. However rose-tinted the glasses we may wear, Biden did no favors to his chances of re-election in November. Highly respected journals like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, joined with this lowly columnist, an ardent supporter of the Democratic cause and a virulent Never Trumper, in sending a message, immediately after the debate, to the 81-year-old incumbent president to drop out of the fray, for the greater good of the nation.",
    "In fact, polls after the debate found that 72% of all voters did not want Biden running in November. Also, many of the mega donors of the Democratic Party are insisting that the party replaces Biden with a younger, more electable candidate \u2013 or else.",
    "On reflection, however, comparing 90 minutes of incoherently trying to tell the truth, against a lifetime of political integrity and personal decency, may be considered an unfair rush to judgment. Yes, those 90 minutes scared the hell out of us \u2013 but was it just one bad night, caused by a variety of reasons \u2013 over preparation, jet lag after a busy travel schedule, attending international conferences and domestic fundraisers? Or was it the inexorable march towards senescence, which may not endure for another four years?",
    "We may also, in an equally arbitrary fashion, have been too hasty in presenting the win of the debate to Trump, based entirely on his facility to coherently and confidently spew a stream of lies and exaggerations for 90 minutes. Lying comes as naturally to Trump as breathing, and his frequent stumbles and rambles are often hilarious and border on insanity.",
    "President Biden has always been a decent man whose integrity has never been in question. A man who has risen like a Phoenix from the ashes of a series of unspeakable tragedies, time and again, a symbol of hope and renewal. A brief look at his career will demonstrate the enduring quality of his resilience.",
    "A Juris Doctor from Syracuse Law College, New York, Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate from his home state of Delaware in 1972. He served in this capacity until he was picked by President Barack Obama to be his Vice-President, from 2009 to 2017.",
    "In 1966, Biden married Nellia Hunter, a fellow student at Syracuse, and they had three children, Joseph \u201cBeau\u201d Biden, Robert Hunter Biden and Christina \u201cAmy\u201d Biden. A short while after his election as Senator, his wife, Nellia and infant daughter, Amy were killed in a car accident, with sons, Beau and Hunter (aged three and two, respectively) hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Biden. a \u201cliberal catholic\u201d, was assailed with religious doubt and even contemplated suicide, writing that \u201cGod had played a horrible trick\u201d on him. He had decided to retire from politics to raise his two sons. However, Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield persuaded him to continue his work in the Senate.",
    "In 1975, Biden met Jill Tracy Jacobs, an English teacher at Delaware Community College. They were married in the United Nations chapel in 1977. Biden credits his new wife with rekindling his enthusiasm to continue in his political career. They have one daughter, Ashley Biden, a social worker married to a physician.",
    "Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1988 and 2008.",
    "In February and August 1988, Biden suffered two life-threatening intercranial aneurysms, which kept him away from the Senate for seven months. Though his cardiologist gave him little chance of survival, he made an amazing and complete recovery from both these aneurysms, with no residual damage. He has been an extremely active Senator since, focusing on foreign relations, criminal justice and energy and drug policies.",
    "While he was President Obama\u2019s Vice-President, Biden lost his beloved son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. Beau was 46-years-old. He had been a rising star in the Democratic Party, having served as a Major in Delaware\u2019s National Guard, deployed to Iraq in 2008 \u2013 2009. He served as Delaware\u2019s Attorney General from 2007 to 2015. Biden, heartbroken over his son\u2019s death, considered stepping down as Vice-President. President Obama, who valued greatly the counsel of his great good friend and Vice-President, prevailed upon Biden to stay the course till the end of their second term in 2016.",
    "Biden decided not to contest the presidency in 2016, when he announced, flanked by his wife and President Obama in the Rose Garden, that the window for a successful presidential campaign \u201chas closed\u201d, attributing his family\u2019s inconsolable grief following the death of their beloved son.",
    "Over 50 years of a remarkable life, with unspeakable tragedies \u2013 Is there a personal tragedy for parents more grievous than burying their child? Of course not. Biden overcame three such tragedies plus the loss of a loving wife. Personal catastrophes that may well have driven a lesser mortal to drugs and suicide.",
    "True to character, Biden continued to be an integral part of the brilliant Obama administration, considered to be one of the greatest Presidencies in US history.",
    "He also helped his younger son, Hunter, control, and finally conquer, his addictions and substance abuse, with unconditional love and support. Hunter is today addiction-free, in the process of facing accountability for crimes, perceived and real, committed during his years of addiction. The fact that he carries the last name of the president of the country gives him no advantage, as President Biden has never intervened in the nation\u2019s judicial process.",
    "Biden capped his dream by winning the presidency in 2020 and pulling the nation out of the economic morass and moral stench left to him by a lifelong criminal. A triumphant life story for the ages, a role model worthy of the deepest respect and admiration.",
    "There is no doubt at all that Joe Biden has slowed down. As he said during a much more animated speech in North Carolina the day after the debate, \u201cI know I am not a young man. I don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to. I don\u2019t talk as smoothly as I used to, I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth\u201d.",
    "The decision about running for a second term of the presidency in November is Biden\u2019s alone. If he feels he would be up to successfully carrying out the toughest job in the world for another four years, we have to support him. That is my opinion. There are others who would rather he quits while he is ahead, his reputation intact, his honor unblemished.",
    "Biden\u2019s choice is clear, though fraught with doubts. Does he retire from politics now, leaving an unparalleled legacy of honor as a Senator, a Vice-President and a President? Or does he take the risk of possibly sacrificing the democracy of the nation by losing the November election to a convicted felon, who will sell the country to the highest bidder? Or, even if Biden does win a second term, will he be able to negotiate the toughest job in the world in the face of the grim prospect cognitive deficiency, which is becoming more apparent every passing day?",
    "Whatever doom and gloom polls project, I am confident that Trump, the most evil and ignorant human being in history, will be defeated in November, even by a reasonably rational cockroach. After all, the American voter has always rejected him at every election he has contested in the past. He was illegally elected to the presidency by a minority vote of three million popular votes to Hillary Clinton in 2016, with proven collusion from Russia, and election interference through illegal campaign finance, as proved by the recent New York hush-money case. Trump and the Republican Party had dismal records in the midterms in 2018 and 2022, with every candidate endorsed by Trump suffering embarrassing losses. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election by a record seven million+ votes to Joe Biden.",
    "Whatever then would make a sane voter elect him, especially after his treasonous performance over the past eight years, when he has been convicted of 34 felonies and arrested and on bail on numerous other counts of obstruction of justice, sedition and espionage? Trials he has been able to delay till after the November election, with a little bit of help from the most corrupt Supreme Court in US history.",
    "If he is not just a whiny little bitch who falsely claims that he has done nothing wrong, that he is the victim of the greatest witch-hunt in history, then why is he not super-anxious to have the trials against him heard expeditiously so that his innocence is conclusively proved before the election? Yes, it\u2019s a rhetorical question.",
    "If the fear of the loss of the privilege of white supremacy drives the American voter to the insanity of re-electing Trump in November for a further four years, he will rule the country like an evil monarch, with the complete backing of the aforementioned corrupt Supreme Court, based on its recent ruling on Presidential Immunity. He will commit any crime, including the assassination and incarceration of political opponents, with impunity and assurance of total immunity.",
    "In all these circumstances, the final decision must be made by President Biden and all sections of the Democratic Party, the Biden family, Governors, Senators, House Representatives, donors, and the rank and file, leaving all prejudices, emotions aside, with one objective for November, and one objective only.",
    "That vital objective is the nomination of a candidate who will have the best chance of ensuring that Donald Trump does not win a second term. A candidate who will also be strong enough, ruthless enough, to quell the violence Trump will surely incite as he refuses to concede defeat. The future of the greatest democracy in the world is under threat. The stakes could not be higher.",
    "If Trump is elected in November, then I apologize for every word I have written over the past eight years. America has changed beyond my recognition during the last decade, and my opinions have been totally out of date. I have been writing about a country I loved that apparently exists no longer, a country which gave me a second chance, and most importantly, made available to my children the best education in the world their exceptional talents demanded.",
    "The conclusion of the dissent of Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the Supreme Court ruling on Presidential Immunity, issued on July 1, not only makes for interesting reading but lends credence to my opinion of the radical changes wrought during the Trump years:",
    "\u201cNever in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law. Moving forward, however, all former Presidents will be cloaked in such immunity.",
    "\u201cIf the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop.",
    "\u201cThe relationship of the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king, above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent\u201d.",
    "Dr Upul Wijayawardhana concludes his excellent analysis in his article, God save America, in the Island on July 1:",
    "\u201cThere is no mechanism to replace Biden, the only avenue open being him opting to withdraw. That does not seem to be happening. If he does not and wins the race in November, the only choice is to say: God save America\u201d.",
    "May I respectfully point out to Dr Wijayawardhana that if President Biden does not withdraw and wins the race in November, then God would indeed have saved America.",
    "The real problem would arise if Biden does not withdraw and loses the election to the Orange Jesus. In that event, there will be no God in all the heavens who will be able to save America from becoming a satellite kleptocracy of Putin\u2019s Russia.",
