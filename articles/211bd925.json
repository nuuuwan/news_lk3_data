    "Baur & Co. Ltd., also known as Baurs, is a name synonymous with diverse industry sectors in Sri Lanka, including a distinctive reputation for being a pioneering and innovative agriculture expert, actively blending both scientific and professional know-how to steer the nation\u2019s future direction.",
    "This year, Baurs celebrates 127 years of continued growth and expansion across its business units.",
    "In 2021, Baurs took on the organic fertiliser challenge when the country decided to move towards organic agriculture, following the company\u2019s long-standing R&D efforts and a collective masterplan for sustainable organic agriculture, together with a team of experts from Switzerland-based FiBL and HAFL and diverse stakeholders across the country\u2019s agriculture sector.",
    "Earlier this year, it announced the commercial sales of super urea following successful trials initiated since 2018. Its pioneer super urea, a nitrogen dual stabiliser, reduces both ammonia volatilisation and nitrification of nitrogen fertilisers in the soil, encouraging sustainable farming practices by helping improve nitrogen fertiliser application efficiency, enhancing crop yield while reducing environmental impact, and healthier food for the communities across the island.",
    "Its pharma business is also seeing a surge in growth, backed by its extensive distributor network and world-class service and technology integration. Last year, Baurs inked a deal to be the sole importer and distributor of multinational pharmaceutical giant GSK\u2019s prescription medicines and vaccines in Sri Lanka. Growing its portfolio of global healthcare brands, Baurs also partnered for the distribution of German multinational medical device company\u2019s Sri Lankan operations, Fresenius Medical Care Lanka.",
    "Baurs has also come a long way in its digital transformation efforts, taking the lead in sales force automation which goes beyond mere mobility, data and analytics, to comprehensively integrate the various businesses and channels, and also actively embracing cyber security and disaster recovery measures, ML, AI and IoT among others. Its IT director, Anoja Basnayake, spearheading the many initiatives, was recognised among the inaugural National CIO List 2023 of the Computer Society of Sri Lanka.",
    "Baurs is also making strides in providing world-class hospitality education through its Swiss Hotel Management Academy (SHMA) and the Skills for Sustainable Growth (SSG) project, a partnership initiated and funded by the Swiss government aimed at preparing students to not only gain technical knowledge in hospitality but also enhance their practical skills, real-world experience, and soft skills development. The SSG project reached a new milestone with the opening of 10 learning centres across the island this year, and a goal of skilling 2,240 youths by the end of 2025.",
    "The company\u2019s sustainability agenda also saw a new solar installation at its head office with a capacity of 168.56 kWp which can cover more than 60% of the energy needs, generating an impressive 233,792 kWh annually. This will allow Baurs to offset 170,622 kg of carbon emissions every year and contribute to reducing its environmental footprint. Looking ahead, Baurs plans to further its investment in renewable energy by installing a 7 MW solar system across its warehouses and other facilities. Baurs is known for its remarkable breakthroughs and innovation since its inception, taking reigns as being the first of many. Rooted in its Swiss traditions and values and Foundation Alfred et Eug\u00e9nie Baur as its shareholder, Baurs has always stood by Sri Lanka, in the best interest of its employees and citizens. Its community outreach and social responsibility initiatives have had a profound impact on society, including its collaboration with the UN Global Compact initiative.",
    "When it comes to wellbeing and development of its employees, Baurs has various initiatives such as Business Model Innovation Training for Future Leaders conducted by BMI Labs Switzerland and Baurs Leadership Grooming for Young Leaders designed to nurture and develop young leaders. It also offers flexible working hours and assistance for employee families during difficult times. And its Baurs Toast Master Club has achieved several accolades including the Golden Club Award 2023/2024 \u2013 President Distinguished Club, Smedley Award, Dynamic Duo Award, Eight-80 Award, and Early Bird Renewal Award.",
    "Baurs CEO/Managing Director Rolf Blaser emphasised that \u201cWe don\u2019t aim to be the best in Sri Lanka but to be the best for Sri Lanka.\u201d"
