    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s credit to private borrowers expanded by 201.5 billion rupees in July, after a record 221 billion growth in June, official data show, amid broadly deflationary policy that gave confidence with stable costs, but there have been some inflationary swaps recently.",
    "In the seven months to July, Sri Lanka\u2019s banks now disbursed 901.6 billion rupees in credit, compared to 341 billion rupees last year.",
    "In the 12-months to July 2025, private credit has expanded by 1,485 billion rupees, compared to 493 billion rupees last year, taking the annual growth to 19.6 percent.",
    "SOE credit also fell in July. It is not clear whether this is due to improved finances of Ceylon Electricity Board.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s private credit started to expand in the latter part of 2023, after a currency crisis and default triggered by rate cuts and the single policy rate (mid-corridor targeting), which destroyed purchasing power and pushed rates to high levels in the previous year.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has conducted broadly deflationary policy since late 2022 and also appreciated the currency, allowing pension funds and the people to partially recover some of the lost purchasing power and the real value of savings.",
    "By missing its high 5 percent inflation target, giving people planning any investment stable prices to fund and complete projects. A 5 percent inflation target, can bloat construction costs over 15 percent in a project that take 3 years to complete.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s current administration has also provided policy stability, analysts say, except for some hiccups in external trade, including a forced re-export of salt to provide profits to a state connected salt factories, undermining the economic freedoms of the common man, enforcing a salt monopoly dating back to the VOC company.",
    "The central bank started to deny stable prices to investors in the 1980s, after the IMF\u2019s Second Amendment soaring project costs including for residential house as it engaged in aggressive open market operations and currency depreciation.",
    "Macro-economists at the time ignored advice given to then President J R Jayewardene to watch the central bank\u2019s Treasury bill stock from open market or other operations and building material prices and instead opted for competitive exchange rates and social unrest as advocated by the \u2018Washington consensus\u2019, critics say.",
    "RELATED : How Sri Lanka rejected Singapore monetary advice and politicians, people paid the price",
    "Without inflationary policy it is difficult for macro-economists to destroy real savings with inflation and push up nominal interest rates.",
    "Sri Lanka needs a narrower inflation target to stop stagflation, BOP crises: Bellwether",
    "Sri Lanka needs a narrower inflation target to stop stagflation, BOP crises: BellwetherSee more",
    "Macro-economists can still deny stable prices to an economy by currency depreciation even if there is public pressure against inflationary policy per se.",
    "Banks, savers and investors can still be mis-directed from rate cuts purely through \u2018signalling\u2019.",
    "Analysts have warned the Treasury to buy its own dollars if the central bank is not willing to run sufficient deflationary policy to collect reserves as a monetary authority with a policy rate cannot be depended on to be a \u2018banker to the government\u2019 as they were before the policy rate.",
    "In the current IMF program there is no requirement to reduce domestic assets of the central bank, but it has to increase foreign assets. The only reduction is the paying in of coupons on its restructured bond portfolio.",
    "Concerns have been raised over recent rate cuts, which were carried out with \u2018signalling\u2019, as well as a so-called \u2018buffer strategy\u2019 which may discourage banks from rolling over government debt as it had happened in recent currency crises.",
    "Rate cuts through signalling and moral suasion will not create actual forex shortages unlike open market operations and drive the credit system to a quick currency crisis, but they can also boost credit and drive up asset prices.",
    "Up to now however, a scarce reserve regime has been operated with no liquidity provided through state liquidity forecasts to lend without deposits. Such a regime can incentivize banks to raise deposit rates subject to any inflationary swaps.",
    "Inflationary swaps transfers the forex risk from banks to the government.",
    "Analysts have also warned that if money in the \u2018fiscal buffer\u2019 were originally deposited in the central bank originally when private credit was down, using them now can hit the exchange rate and/or reduce reserves, while keeping rates down, analysts have warned.",
    "If the fiscal reserve was not deposited in the central bank and were lent to other parties, a domestic buffer cannot reduce rates for any length of time, analysts have pointed out.",
    "To allow such activity, buffers have to be invested out as an external sovereign wealth fund, especially for a small and fairly open economy which is dependent on exports and remittances as a large share of GDP, and uses them for imports.",
    "Sri Lanka has exchange controls due to a deeply flawed operating framework of the central bank and also trade controls which intensify in line with intensifying anchor conflicts. (Colombo/Aug06/2025)"
