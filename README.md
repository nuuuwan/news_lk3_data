### Ranil-Sajith divide causes splits in Muslim political parties

*2024-08-23 05:22:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ranil-Sajith-divide-causes-splits-in-Muslim-political-parties/4-765897) · `en`

Nominations have closed for the long awaited 2024 Presidential election. 39 candidates are in the fray. It is widely acknowledged by the press and public that the chief presidential contenders are incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa and JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Two others expected to make a mark are Namal Rajapaksa and Dilith Jayaweera.

However the icing on the winning candidate’s cake would be the minority vote. In a keenly contested poll that is likely to trifurcate the Sinhala vote in near equal proportion, the minority community vote could very well provide the necessary numbers to clinch victory. In such a situation the voting pattern of the premier numerical minorities assumes crucial importance.

### Make your vote count

*2024-08-23 05:16:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Make-your-vote-count/4-765896) · `en`

In a true democracy, the selection of candidates and the election process should involve the entire population equally. Unfortunately, our current election rules allow only a select few to become candidates without requiring any public endorsement, such as a stepwise regional election process within the party. Our system favours existing politicians and makes it virtually impossible to register a political party to address specific issues. It is a significant obstacle to a fair and inclusive democratic process. Despite the wishes expressed by the ordinary people during ‘Aragalaya 2022,’ we are left with mostly the same 225 candidates to choose from once again, a situation that should concern us all.

### Civil Society appeal for abolition of Executive Presidency

The experience of 46 years of the operation of the 1978 Constitution shows that the executive

presidential system has not delivered on any of the aims for which it was introduced

We the undersigned call upon all candidates contesting the forthcoming 2024 Presidential election to firmly and publicly commit to the abolition of the executive presidential system within the first year of the next Parliament.

The experience of 46 years of the operation of the 1978 Constitution shows that the executive presidential system has not delivered on any of the aims for which it was introduced: accelerated and sustained economic growth and development; communal harmony; and political stability. Executive presidentialism has only had a negligible impact on development. It has worsened rather than improved peace and stability, by accelerating ethnic conflict and making our political system prone to frequent crises.

*2024-08-23 03:41:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/miot-international-india-offers-revolutionary-solution-for-severe-knee-pain/) · `en`

MIOT International, Chennai, India – a 1000 bedded multidisciplinary quaternary care hospital, has introduced its latest revolutionary procedure, Genicular Artery Embolization, a minimally invasive, pinhole procedure that reduces knee inflammation and provides pain relief to patients with severe knee osteoarthritis.

Beyond the age of 40 years, the gradual wear and tear of the knee joints leads to progressive loss of articular cartilage, the tissue that provides cushioning between the bones in the knee joint, known as knee osteoarthritis. The friction due to rubbing of the knee bones causes severe pain, swelling and stiffness, affecting everyday activities like sitting, standing, walking, bending and climbing stairs.

Patients with an early or moderate stage of osteoarthritis tend to seek relief through conventional treatments like lubricants and medication; however, they realize that these treatments have undesirable side effects and also affect their kidney.

🟩

Opposition leader and United People's Power Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa says that the government cannot build a law.

He said this in a post shared on social media after a court ruling on local government elections.

The appointment of the Inspector General of Police, the Supreme Court's ruling against the VVS, and the verdict of violating the fundamental rights by not holding the local government elections are the obvious blunt warnings of the Supreme Court.

The government cannot build a law, which cannot be upheld. This is the structure that confirms our stability.

We must act before this legislation affects our economy and the future of our future.
