  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday highlighted the significance of the newly signed \u2018Puluwan Sri Lanka\u2019 (Sri Lanka Can) agreement, stressing that it is not intended to form a new political party but rather to unite the nation and build a brighter future.",
    "The agreement, endorsed by 34 political parties and alliances, symbolises a collective commitment to overcoming the country\u2019s challenges and rebuilding for the future.",
    "The \u2018Puluwan Sri Lanka\u2019 agreement, according to the President, represents a new force in Sri Lankan politics, aiming to unite all communities and ensure long-term progress for the nation. He said the country has emerged as a new force, uniting when the country\u2019s political parties were in disarray, and it is essential to continue this program for another five years, during which a new leadership would have been born in this country, one that the country has not seen in recent times.",
    "\u201cIt is crucial to move forward with this team, with the aim of building a stronger nation. Our goal is to develop Sri Lanka by fostering the growth of our villages and uniting the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",
    "During the ceremony of the agreement signing, Wickremesinghe pointed out that those who signed are individuals who faced the country\u2019s economic difficulties head-on, unlike others who chose to step away.",
    "The convention, blessed by religious leaders from various faiths, signifies a unified approach to supporting the President in the upcoming Presidential election.",

Jayamini Jinadasa of the United Social Democratic Party was present at the event.",
    "Addressing the gathering, Wickremesinghe emphasised that the primary focus of this election should be on securing the future of the country, rather than the political careers of individuals.  \u201cI am not going to promote myself at the Presidential election, but will only focus and talk about the country. This year\u2019s Presidential election is all about the future of the nation,\u201d Wickremesinghe stressed.",
    "He reminded the public that the country was on the brink of economic collapse, which could have prevented the election altogether.",
    "The President underscored that the purpose of this election is to confirm and secure the progress achieved so far.",
    "\u201cHad the economy collapsed back then, there would not have been an opportunity for this election. This is something everyone should remember. The purpose of this Presidential election is to confirm the progress of the country. While other candidates are asking for votes, claiming to be the best person to lead the country, I am asking the people to vote with their own future and the future of their children in mind. Let\u2019s move forward together with Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "Reflecting on the economic challenges faced, Wickremesinghe described how the country had to make difficult decisions to stabilise the economy and improve the situation for all citizens.",
    "\u201cWe inherited a bankrupt country, an era of queues for fuel, gas, food, and medicine. We had no money; some days with not even a million dollars available. We had to make tough decisions to lift the country out of bankruptcy, and these were not easy choices. Just as a parent or family member might have to make difficult decisions when caring for a sick child, we made these decisions for the sake of the country.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe extend our gratitude to the people who endured hardships during these challenging times. We took over a nation with a collapsed economy and have since managed to control inflation and increase foreign reserves. This progress was achieved in partnership with the people,\u201d he added.",
    "He expressed gratitude to the people for their resilience during tough times and highlighted the Government\u2019s efforts to increase social benefits, enhance foreign reserves, and improve the livelihoods of low-income families.",
    "The President urged the nation to continue along the path of economic recovery and development, stressing that abandoning the program now would jeopardise the hard-earned gains.",
    "\u201cThe question now is whether to continue this program or abandon it halfway. We engaged in negotiations with 18 countries and 21 institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, to establish economic stability in this country. To continue along this path, we must adhere to the agreements in place. Any amendments would require renegotiating with these 21 countries and institutions, a process that took us two years to complete and would take another two years to revise. However, we cannot afford to go another year without these concessions. We must decide whether to allow this system to collapse and risk losing the financial gains we have made,\u201d he pointed out.",
    "He called on citizens to focus on the future, particularly for the younger generation, and to support the continuation of the current leadership\u2019s efforts.",
    "\u201cWe also need to consider how to move forward, building a developed country and creating a better future for our youth. The future of our nation is at stake. While some only think five to six years ahead, Gen Z looks 20 to 30 years into the future, and many are contemplating leaving the country due to concerns about their prospects. Our responsibility is to build this country for them, ensuring they have a future here,\u201d he stressed.",
    "Prime Minister Gunawardena said when a country is rebuilt from a state of collapse, its people will never forget the leader who spearheaded that transformation. \u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe stands as the sole leader who accepted the responsibility of rebuilding the country\u2019s economy during one of its most challenging periods. With the support of 134 Members of Parliament, the President successfully led the Government through this crisis,\u201d he stressed.",
    "He also said Wickremesinghe has laid a strong foundation for the future by upholding the people\u2019s right to a secure life. \u201cWhen comparing the leaders running in this year\u2019s Presidential election, there is no one who matches the current President\u2019s parliamentary history, Government experience, and international relationships. Therefore, we must acknowledge that all our political leaders are united in securing his victory, which will be a victory for the nation,\u201d Gunawardena said."
