    "Before leaving Sri Lanka to work in Guyana in March 1994, I was accustomed to seeing over two dozen bodyguards and a significant security detail for heads of government attending events. Sri Lanka, being in the throes of a brutal separatist war, necessitated such precautions. Naturally, I expected a similar setup when welcoming VIPs to the Guyana Pegasus Hotel on my first day of work. Standing at the lobby entrance alongside my Deputy General Manager, Shaun, I was eager to make a good first impression in this new environment.",
    "Imagine my surprise when the Prime Minister of Guyana, Mr. Sam Hinds, arrived for a banquet accompanied by just his driver\u2014no security detail, no fanfare. His demeanour was friendly, jovial, and humble. As I welcomed him to the hotel, he turned the tables and welcomed me to Guyana: \u201cThank you for deciding to work in Guyana and share your global experience to help our tourism and hotel industry, which are still in their infancy,\u201d he said warmly. This initial connection proved invaluable; 13 years later, it facilitated my involvement in a significant consultancy assignment with the Government of Guyana.",
    "That evening, Mr. Hinds surprised me further. As he was leaving the hotel, I wished him a good night. Turning to his driver, he said: \u201cYou may return to my residence with the car. I had a sumptuous dinner at the Pegasus and need a little exercise. I will walk back to the residence.\u201d And with that, he strolled down the main road, alone and unguarded.",
    "The same evening brought another eye-opening encounter. Awaiting the arrival of the First Lady of Guyana, Mrs. Janet Jagan, Shaun remarked, \u201cMrs. Jagan is here.\u201d I scanned the area but saw no sign of a motorcade or entourage. Shaun elaborated, \u201cAs usual, Mrs. Jagan came driving her small car. She went to park the car.\u201d Astonished, I rushed to the car park to greet her. She graciously introduced the lady accompanying her: \u201cThis is my daughter-in-law, Nadia, who is a dancer and choreographer.\u201d",
    "The next day, I welcomed the legendary former West Indies cricket captain, Clive Lloyd, who was staying at the Pegasus for a few days. \u201cEvery time I come to Guyana from England; I stay at the Pegasus. This is my home away from home,\u201d he said. Widely revered as one of cricket\u2019s greatest all-rounders and captains, Clive led the West Indies team from 1974 to 1985, spearheading their rise to become the greatest Test and One Day International team of the 20th century. Under his captaincy, the West Indies won two World Cups (1975 and 1979) and achieved a record 36 Test victories, including an 11-match winning streak.",
    "Clive, affectionately nicknamed \u201cSuper Cat,\u201d regaled me with amusing anecdotes, including tales of sharing a room with his cousin, spin-bowling great Lance Gibbs, during his first Test series in 1966 in India. \u201cMy elder cousin Lance was supposed to mentor me, but I learned a few other things from him too!\u201d he quipped with a mischievous grin.",
    "We struck up a lasting friendship, and during my subsequent tenure in Jamaica, Clive attended several parties I hosted at my apartment for other West Indian cricketing legends. Post-retirement, he continued to contribute to cricket as a coach, commentator, and ICC match referee. In 2020, he was knighted by the Queen of England.",
    "Guyana\u2019s landmass is comparable to the United Kingdom\u2019s, but its population of just 750,000 is concentrated mainly along the coastal plain, which comprises only about 5% of the country\u2019s area. The rest is lush, untouched rainforest\u2014a segment of the Amazon shared by eight nations. Georgetown, the capital, sits on the Atlantic Ocean coast at the mouth of the Demerara River. Known as the \u201cGarden City of the Caribbean,\u201d it is the nation\u2019s administrative, financial, and retail hub.",
    "In 1994, Georgetown\u2019s population was around 115,000. The city houses Parliament, the Court of Appeals, and the State House, the official residence of the head of state. It is also home to the Secretariat of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), an international organisation representing 15 member states. Familiarising myself with Georgetown\u2019s layout and culture became a priority during my early days in Guyana.",
    "One of Georgetown\u2019s unique features is its 280-mile seawall, constructed to protect low-lying coastal settlements from flooding and erosion by the Atlantic Ocean. Much of Guyana\u2019s coastal area lies below sea level at high tide, making the seawall a vital infrastructure element. Historians note that two estates north of the present Georgetown seawall were completely washed away by 1804, prompting the British colonial administration to undertake seawall construction projects.",
    "On my second day in Guyana, I requested a guided tour of the seawall near the hotel. Standing atop the structure, I marvelled at its historical significance. However, when I inquired about the other two original seawalls, the security manager casually remarked, \u201cThose were washed away some time ago!\u201d This revelation prompted me to relocate my office from the ground floor to the first floor\u2014just to be safe!",

    "Director Maniram Prashad and the outgoing General Manager Paul Stevenson, welcoming me.",
    "During my first week in Guyana, the hotel hosted a cocktail reception for 400 guests. The event served as a joint farewell for Paul Stevenson, the outgoing General Manager, and a welcome party for me. Many of the attendees were key contacts who would prove essential to performing my duties effectively. The people of Guyana were warm, curious, and eager to learn about my background. I was frequently invited to house parties, social gatherings, and excursions, which provided me with invaluable opportunities to immerse myself in the local culture.",
    "I moved the venue for the weekly General Manager\u2019s cocktail reception to the roof top as I considered it as one of our prime locations, but previously under-utilized. The popularity of that decision among hotel guests, prompted me to do a few other changes in consultation with guests and the staff.",
    "Two men became close friends: Maniram Prashad, a businessman and the only Guyanese Director of the hotel board, (later Minister of Tourism), and Donald Sinclair, an academic leading the University of Guyana\u2019s tourism degree programme. He recommended me for a Visiting Professorship in Tourism Marketing at the university. Later, Donald and I collaborated on scholarly publications about tourism in Guyana and the Amazon.",
    "However, most of my significant relationships in Georgetown were with seven remarkable women. Among them were:",
    "Janet Jagan\u2013 The American-born First Lady and later President of Guyana. Our mutual interest in visual arts led to collaborative projects.",
    "Yvonne Hinds\u2013 Chairperson of the Guyana Relief Council (GRC) and wife of the Prime Minister. Yvonne enlisted my help for fundraising projects, strengthening our bond.",
    "Supriya Singh\u2013 An interior designer and arts enthusiast, Supriya became my co-producer for cultural shows and a lifelong friend.",
    "Leah Hibbins\u2013 Executive Director of the Tourism Association of Guyana (TAG). Our shared love for visual art deepened our friendship.",
    "Nadia Jabour\u2013 A florist and entrepreneur who later became my student in both Guyana and Canada.",
    "Nadia Jagan\u2013 A dancer and choreographer who collaborated on stage productions.",
    "Judy Gildari\u2013 A journalist who provided extensive publicity for the Pegasus Hotel\u2019s events.",
    "My introduction to Yvonne Hinds came at a house party shortly after my arrival. \u201cI read about you in today\u2019s Stabroek News. You have a colourful background. Apart from being a busy international hotelier, you are also an artist, published writer, award-winning composer and a stage producer. Can you produce high-level show to raise funds for GRC?\u201d Mrs. Hinds did not waste any time in getting to the point. I knew that working with the Prime Minister\u2019s wife on a fund-raising project would be an excellent, public relations opportunity for the hotel.",
    "I agreed but admitted my unfamiliarity with local talent. Enter Supriya Singh, who confidently volunteered to connect me with the right people. Within four months, we staged a grand production titled \u2018Lights in the Forest\u2019, a Champagne dinner theatre experience in the Pegasus ballroom. The event was a resounding success, blending dance, music, and poetry in an innovative format.",
    "Even 30 years after leaving Guyana, I remain in touch with Supriya, Leah, and Nadia Jabour, now primarily through social media. After reading my previous article on Guyana, Supriya wrote, \u201cYour arrival made quite an impression. Your many talents, which you so generously shared with the Guyanese people, are still remembered.\u201d",
    "My tenure in Guyana was a period of profound cultural exchange, professional growth, and the cultivation of enduring friendships. The experiences and connections I forged there continue to shape my journey as a global hotelier. Shortly after my arrival in Guyana, I established a solid foundation centred on public relations, driven by a desire to create a platform for memorable experiences\u2014not only for the hotel team and its customers but also for myself.",
