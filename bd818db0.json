    "Multilateral debt fell from 10,907 million US dollars to 10,812 million US dollars from June to September.",

    "Sri Lanka had about 1,819 million US dollars of unpaid interest, since the default.",
    "Provided there is monetary stability (no foreign shortages are created by inflationary open market operations to cut rates) the outstanding stock of debt does not grow linearly with new financing of the deficit, as dollar loans can be repaid without borrowing new dollars, analysts have shown.",
    "The latest debt bulletin did not have central bank debt. However, any foreign reserves built against domestic assets sales of the central bank also reduces net foreign debt."
