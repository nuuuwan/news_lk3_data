    "\u201cThis is the end of an era where organised crime thrived under political protection. Nothing is above the law and no individual, regardless of position, is beyond accountability. Our political goal is to build a law-abiding society, where justice and fairness prevail,\u201d he added.",

    "Public Security Ministry Secretary Ravi Seneviratne underscored that the Government has granted full independence to law enforcement agencies, enabling them to act free of political interference for the first time in decades.",
    "He noted that organised crimes in Sri Lanka have been difficult to eradicate because they were built and protected with the support of politicians.",
    "\u201cMost underworld figures continue to operate from overseas bases in India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Abu Dhabi, where they are closely tied to drug trafficking,\u201d Seneviratne said.",
    "IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya noted that while political involvement in crime was widespread in the past, law enforcement now operates without interference.",
