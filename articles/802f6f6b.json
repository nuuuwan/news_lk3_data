    "Colombo, Feb 08 (Daily Mirror)- Sri Lanka has announced an increase in monthly allowances for disabled individuals, kidney patients, and elderly citizens, effective January 2024, Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said.",
    "Under the revised scheme, monthly allowances for kidney patients and disabled persons will see a notable raise from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,500, while elderly citizens' allowances will increase from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000.",
    "Beneficiaries enrolled in the 'Aswesuma' welfare program, eligible for these allowances, can anticipate the increased payments, which will be implemented retrospectively from January 2024.\u00a0 The disbursement of these enhanced allowances is scheduled to commence on April 01, offering much-needed relief to recipients across the country.",
    "Furthermore, the government has extended the validity period for the 'vulnerable' and 'transitional' social groups until December 31. As part of this extension, the existing categories will be merged, consolidating approximately 800,000 families under the 'vulnerable' classification. These families will receive a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000 until the end of December, replacing the previous allowance of Rs. 2,500 for the 'transitional' group."
