    "US President Donald Trump is known for his about-turns, which are legion. When he declared what he described as reciprocal tariffs, he said his decision was final, and it was his way or highway. But he changed his mind subsequently, and his suo motu downward tariff revision has encouraged many countries like Sri Lanka to seek further tariff reductions. A few more rounds of talks between Sri Lanka and the US on tariffs are on the cards.",
    "While a Sri Lankan delegation is preparing for a hard bargain, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that instead of promising to buy Coca-Cola or gas in return for a US tariff reduction, Sri Lanka should leverage the fact that tariff hikes by the US, which is a member of the Official Creditor Committee (OCC), supporting the IMF bailout package, will only make it even more difficult for Sri Lanka to repay its debt.",
    "The US tariff increases could not have come at a worse time for Sri Lanka, which is struggling to emerge from its worst-ever economic crisis. They are \u2018like evil-causing Saturn falling into a beggar\u2019s bowl\u2019, as a popular saying goes in this country.",
    "However, Sri Lanka has only itself to blame for its predicament, which is far worse than those of most other nations affected by the US tariff hikes. If it had diversified its exports and export destinations over the years, while properly managing its foreign currency reserves, it would have been able to cushion the US tariff blow to a considerable extent at least in the short term.",
    "Its failure to do so has bolstered the ruling NPP\u2019s argument that none of its predecessors got macroeconomic fundamentals right. One may recall that the JVP ridiculed President Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s garment factory programme by claiming that it would make the Sri Lankan women stitch jangi (underwear) for suddhis (white women) and even coined slogans such as kollanta pavement, kellanta garment (pavements for boys and garment factories for girls) to whip up ani-government sentiments in the 1980s. Ironically, the JVP-led NPP has had to protect the garment industry, which will be the worst affected by the US tariff increases. Its erstwhile comrades in the Frontline Socialist Party, etc., are now accusing it of following Ranil\u2019s economic policies.",
    "Stressing that Sri Lanka\u2019s economy will not survive if the US tariffs remain as high as 30%, Wickremesinghe has argued that having underwritten IMF-mandated debt restructuring, the US should help Sri Lanka. His argument is logical, and one cannot but agree with him. However, the problem is that Trump is impervious to reasoning and acts whimsically. Diplomacy as well as pragmatism is not one of Trump\u2019s traits; he even tears into visiting foreign dignitaries at the White House if they express views that run counter to his.",
    "All tariff reductions will eventually have to be sanctioned by Trump, and he is no respecter of agreements and obligations. He has turned free trade on its head, opted for isolationist policies, and even antagonised traditional US allies in Europe and other regions. There\u2019s the rub. What Wickremesinghe has suggested by way of having US tariffs reduced is apparently a long shot but is well worth trying.",
    "Trump\u2019s tariffs are bound to generate a blowback effect that significantly harms US industries due to supply chain disruptions, the reconfiguration of costs and the resultant losses or reduced profit margins. Trump may be compelled to respond to domestic pressure, and it is being speculated that there may be another round of tariff reductions. However, there is no guarantee that he will give in to pressure, domestic or foreign. Sri Lanka and other developing countries struggling to keep their economies afloat will be really lucky if moral suasion has the desired effect on Trump.",
