    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s future development initiatives including highway construction will be in accordance with a National Physical Plan which has been drafted and is to be reviewed by the public before going to the cabinet, according to the Minister of Urban Development and Housing.",
    "Minister Prasanna Ranatunga told a gathering at an event in Colombo on Friday June 23 that measures will be taken upon cabinet approval of the plan, a draft of which has been submitted to President Ranil Wickremesignhe.",
    "A statement from the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said on Friday quoting Ranatunga that the plan is in alignment with the president\u2019s vision for the country\u2019s development by 2048. The National Physical Plan will serve as a blueprint for various key development initiatives, including the construction of highways across the country, the PMD said.",
    "The implementation of the programme will commence as a two-year pilot project in the Northern and Eastern provinces, as well as in the districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, the minister has said.",
    "\u201cThe recent COVID epidemic has plunged the country into a crisis, greatly impacting the construction industry. Ongoing projects and constructions were halted, and the import restrictions further weakened the sector, leading to a suspension of payments to contractors,\u201d said Ranatunga.",
    "According to the minister, eight special projects have been revived as part of the president\u2019s short and medium term strategies to address Sri Lanka\u2019s economic situation following the 2022 currency crisis. Responding to the President\u2019s directive, the construction contract with China for 2,000 houses will commence next week, with a focus on providing affordable housing to low-income earners, Ranatunga was quoted as saying.",
    "A budget of five billion rupees has been allocated to restart previously halted housing projects, to be carried out in phases. The minister claimed that, as the economy normalises and investor confidence returns, foreign investors have shown interest in the country and the government has already engaged in discussions with them, \u201cgiving hope for the recovery of the construction industry\u201d.",
    "Given the lack of alternatives, the construction industry is facing significant challenges, he further said.",
    "\u201cThe exodus of experienced construction teams seeking opportunities abroad has been detrimental to the country\u2019s development. Our data indicates that over 100,000 individuals have been affected by the collapse of construction activities. Efforts are being made to engage these individuals in future government projects.\u201d",
    "Ranatunga also noted a lack of control over cement pricing in the past.",
    "\u201cHowever, the current situation indicates some regulation in cement prices. The government has decided to import cement from India and Pakistan through the Building Materials Corporation. Arrangements are being made to utilise the imported cement for special projects, which could potentially reduce the price of cement in the country by 400-500 rupees,\u201d the statement said.
