ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) has been losing millions of rupees due to poorly charged royalty fees amid numerous inefficiencies, the parliament Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting was told recently, the parliament said in a statement.

This was disclosed when the COPE inquired into the Auditor General’s reports for GMSB for 2022 and 2023 and its current performance.

In one instance, the government lost Rs.12 million because the GMSB only charged royalty fee for 1,594 cubic meters instead of charging the fee up to 45,561 cubic meters, the parliament said.

“Discussions were also held on the calculation of royalty for stone quarries based on the explosives issued for the quarry. It was pointed out by the Committee that due to the use of explosives in an illegal manner, the actual volume of rock removed could not be calculated, resulting in a large loss of revenue to the government,” the Parliament said in the statement.

### Sri Lanka parliament committee approves National Building Research Institute Bill

*2025-09-17 16:14:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-parliament-committee-approves-national-building-research-institute-bill-240935/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s National Building Research Institute Bill, which strengthens the National Building Research Organization’s powers, has been considered and approved by a sectoral oversight committee, parliament said.

“Although the National Building Research Organization has been functioning since 1984, it has not yet been established by an Act of Parliament.

“Therefore, the proposed Bill seeks to provide the Organization with legal status in order to properly fulfil the duties, responsibilities, and services entrusted to it.”

Officials, making submissions before the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Governance, Justice and Civil Protection, pointed out that once the proposed bill is passed, the NBRO would be able to take legal action in instances where Local Government institutions fail to adhere to the recommendations issued by the NBRO with regard to landslides.

The bill is to be taken up for its second reading in parliament on September 23. (Colombo/Sep17/2025)
