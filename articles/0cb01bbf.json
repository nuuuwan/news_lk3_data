    "Marking the beginning of a nationwide initiative to protect and restore Sri Lanka\u2019s iconic landmarks, Asian Paints Causeway has completed the restoration of the Panadura Clock Tower, a symbolic landmark of the Kalutara district.",
    "The restoration of the clock tower began as painters cleaned and repainted the structure, which was in a state of decaying paint. The event was attended by representatives from the Panadura Municipal Council, the Panadura community, local merchants, and officials from Asian Paints Causeway. The clock tower was repainted with SmartCare AquaSafe, a leading exterior paint known for its durability against algae, dirt, and peeling, restoring the tower\u2019s former charm.",
    "Commenting on this initiative, the Regional Head at Asian Paints International, Sireesh Rao stated, \u201cThis repainting initiative marks the beginning of our efforts to uplift society by restoring and preserving significant landmarks across the island. At Asian Paints Causeway, we are committed to meeting the needs of our community, and we believe this project reinforces the trust that local engineers and government authorities have in SmartCare AquaSafe, as they extended their partnership for this effort. This project began with a simple insight,\u00a0Sri Lanka is home to a vast array of historic structures and iconic landmarks, but as a nation, are we doing enough to keep them safe and protected? Driven by this awareness, we launched this project to restore iconic landmarks, beginning with the Panadura Clock Tower, the first of many in our nationwide restoration campaign.\u201d",
    "In commending this project, the Secretary at the Panadura Municipal Council, Ms. Manel Siyabalagoda, remarked, \u201cWe are delighted with the transformation of the Panadura Clock Tower, and this initiative by Asian Paints Causeway has not only restored a significant landmark in Kalutara, but has also given renewed hope to the people of Panadura that this iconic symbol of their town will be safeguarded for years to come.\u201d",
    "Following the restoration of the Panadura Clock Tower, the company plans to extend this initiative to additional landmark sites across Sri Lanka, further demonstrating the exceptional quality and durability of SmartCare AquaSafe while reinforcing its dedication to preserving the nation\u2019s iconic sites.",
