    "The controversial Malwana mansion is a property of the State now and it was set on fire during the Aragalaya time without knowing that it is a State property, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.",
    "He told Parliament that Cabinet approval was granted to take over the Malwana property by the Justice Ministry and the process is now underway.",
    "\"When I learnt through the newspapers that no party has claimed ownership of the Malwana property, I submitted a Cabinet Paper the following day to take it over to the Justice Ministry. It was approved by the Cabinet. The process is moving foward slowly. It will be taken over by the Justice Ministry. Unfortunately, the Aragalaya activists set it on fire, may be while being unaware that it is a State property now,\" he said.",
    "The Minister said this while responding to a statement on the Malwana mansion by NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
