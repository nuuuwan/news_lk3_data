    "The Court of Appeal has issued an interim order against the Gampola Divisional Secretary preventing her from interfering with the activities of the first cable car project in Sri Lanka, which is being built in the Ambuluwawa area.",
    "This order was issued by the Appeals Court after considering a petition filed by a private company alleging that their project is being unduly hindered by the said official.",
    "The application was taken up for consideration today (16) before an Appellate Court bench comprising Judges Mohammad Lafar Tahir and P. Kumaran Ratnam.",
    "Presenting facts before the court, President\u2019s Counsel Ali Sabry, who appeared for the petitioning company, accused the Gampola Divisional Secretary of obstructing the construction work of the cable car project despite the fact that all the relevant government agencies had given the necessary approval.",
    "He charged that various obstacles are being put forth while alleging that there was insufficient safety and such while several persons have also been arrested in connection with this incident and that there had been extensive media coverage regarding this.",
    "The President\u2019s Counsel pointed out that the area where this construction is being carried out is completely under the authority of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and that the Gampola Divisional Secretary has no authority to interfere in its affairs.",
    "Pointing out that due to these obstructions, a situation has arisen where it is no longer possible to complete the relevant project within the stipulated time period, he requested that an interim injunction be issued to prevent obstruction and improper interference in the said project.",
    "After considering the facts presented, the court issued this interim order and also ordered that the petition be called again on October 29.",
    "Gampola Divisional Secretary Dilrukshi Jayaratne, the Sri Lanka Tourism Board and the Board of Investments (BoI) have been named as respondents in the petition."
