  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said early Saturday that Israel and Syria had agreed to a ceasefire following Israel\u2019s intervention this week in fighting between Syrian government forces and rival armed groups.",
    "The announcement came as renewed clashes erupted between Druze groups and Bedouin clans and Syria\u2019s president said he would send troops back in to quell the fighting, which has left tens of thousands of people displaced in a worsening humanitarian crisis.",
    "Barrack said in a statement posted on social platform X that the new ceasefire between Israel and Syria was supported by Turkey, Jordan and other neighboring countries and called for \u201cDruze, Bedouins, and Sunnis to put down their weapons and together with other minorities build a new and united Syrian identity in peace and prosperity with its neighbors.\u201d",
    "Clashes began Sunday between Druze militias and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes in Syria\u2019s southern Sweida province. Government forces intervened, nominally to restore order, but ended up taking the Bedouins\u2019 side against the Druze.",
    "Israel intervened in defense of the Druze, launching dozens of airstrikes on convoys of government fighters and even striking the Syrian Defense Ministry headquarters in central Damascus. The Druze form a substantial community in Israel, where they are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the Israeli military.",
    "The fighting killed hundreds of people over four days, with allegations that Syrian government-affiliated fighters executed Druze civilians and looted and burned homes.",
    "On Wednesday, the Syrian government reached a truce with Druze groups, mediated by the U.S., Turkey and Arab countries, and began withdrawing its forces from the province. Under the accord, Druze factions and clerics were to maintain the internal security in Sweida as government forces pulled out, Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said Thursday.",
    "By late Thursday, clashes were flaring again between the Druze and Bedouin groups in parts of Sweida province, and on Friday al-Sharaa said that the government would send in a \u201cspecialized force to break up clashes and resolve the conflict on the ground.\u201d",
    "Officials had negotiated with Druze factions on an agreement to re-enter the area to impose stability and protect state institutions, according to two Syrian officials who spoke earlier Friday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said an agreement was reached, but later said the deployment was delayed, without giving an explanation.",
    "State media reported that Druze militias had carried out revenge attacks against Bedouin communities, leading to a new wave of displacement.",
    "The governor of neighboring Daraa province said in a statement that more than 1,000 families had been displaced to the area from Sweida as a result of \u201cattacks on Bedouin tribes by outlaw groups.\u201d",
    "The volunteer group Syrian Civil Defense said Friday that the head of its center in Sweida city had been kidnapped by gunmen two days earlier while on his way to evacuate a U.N. team.",
    "The official, Hamza al-Amarin, was driving a van with the insignia of the organization, known as the White Helmets, when he was stopped by militants, the statement said. A person who answered his phone on Thursday said he was safe, it added, but they have been unable to reach him.",
    "The United Nations has been unable to bring in much-needed humanitarian and medical aid because of ongoing clashes.",
    "The United Nations\u2019 migration agency said Friday that nearly 80,000 people had been displaced altogether since clashes started on Sunday.",
    "It also noted that essential services, including water and electricity, have collapsed in Sweida, telecommunications systems are widely disrupted, and health facilities in Sweida and Daraa are under severe strain.",
    "Meanwhile \u201cthere are severe disruptions to supply routes, with insecurity and road closures blocking aid deliveries,\u201d Adam Abdelmoula, U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator in Syria, said in a statement Friday.",
    "The World Health Organization was able to send trauma care supplies to Daraa province, but Sweida remains inaccessible, he said.",
    "\u201cOnce conditions allow, we are planning to send a mission to assess needs and provide critical aid, in full coordination with authorities,\u201d Abdelmoula said.",
    "Bedouin groups and supporters arrived Friday from other areas of Syria to join the fight.",
    "On the outskirts of Sweida, groups of them gathered in front of buildings that had been set ablaze. An armed man who gave his name only as Abu Mariam (\u201cfather of Mariam\u201d) said he had come from the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor to \u201csupport the oppressed.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe will not return to our homes until we crush Al-Hijri and his ilk,\u201d he said, referring to a prominent Druze leader opposed to the government in Damascus, Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri. \u201cWe have nothing to do with civilians and innocent people as long as they stay in their homes.\u201d",
    "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
    "While predominantly Druze, Sweida is also home to Bedouin tribes who are Sunni Muslim and have periodically clashed with the Druze over the years. The latest escalation began with members of a Bedouin tribe in Sweida setting up a checkpoint and attacking and robbing a Druze man, which triggered tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings.",
    "Ahmed Aba Zeid, a Syrian researcher who has studied armed groups in southern Syria, said there is \u201cno specific reason\u201d for the historic tensions between the groups.",
    "\u201cAll of Syria is full of social problems that have no reason,\u201d he said.",
    "In this case, however, \u201cThe state exploited the latest problem to try to change the situation in Sweida, and this only increased the scope of it,\u201d he said.",
    "In Israel, members of the Druze community had called for intervention to protect the Druze in Syria. But elsewhere in the region, Druze leaders have rejected Israeli intervention.",
    "The spiritual leader of the Druze community in Lebanon, Sheikh Sami Abi al-Muna, said Friday at a gathering of Druze officials in Beirut that sectarian clashes in Syria \u201cgive an excuse for Israeli intervention and for blowing up the situation in the region.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe do not accept to request protection from Israel, which we believe is harmful to our history and identity,\u201d he said.",
    "Al-Muna called for all parties to adhere to the ceasefire agreement reached Wednesday and for a national dialogue to address the issues between different communities in Syria.",
    "Lebanese Druze leader Walid Joumblatt, who had been one of the regional figures mediating the ceasefire reached Wednesday, at the same gathering called for the formation of an investigative committee to investigate violations against both Druze and Bedouins in Syria."
