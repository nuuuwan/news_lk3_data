  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government is to take immediate actions to repatriate Sri Lankan nationals who are illegally staying in South Korea after their visas expired.",
    "Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) Chairman Koshala Wickremasinghe said their details will be forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and legal measures will be enforced.",
    "Wickremasinghe urged individuals with expired visas not to remain in South Korea unlawfully, as the future job quotas for Sri Lankans in the country will depend on the behaviour of those already employed there. He made these comments while presenting air tickets to 96 Sri Lankans departing for South Korea yesterday for employment in the manufacturing sector. They are the first group to leave for jobs in South Korea\u2019s manufacturing sector this year (2025).",
    "The SLBFE Chairman further revealed plans to offer job opportunities in South Korea to nearly 8,000 Sri Lankans by the end of 2025.\u00a0 He also mentioned that the bureau intends to send skilled, high-quality workers from Sri Lanka, which is one of the 16 countries that supply labour to South Korea.",
    "Furthermore, he emphasised the significant contribution made by the Sri Lankan expatriates, who remit over $ 6 billion annually to the country, playing a crucial role in boosting the national economy and extended the Government\u2019s gratitude to them."
