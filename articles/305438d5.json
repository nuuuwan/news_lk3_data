    "Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - While condemning the media reports, the Milk Powder Importers\u2019 Association said today that they had not taken any decision to reduce the retail prices of the milk powder packets in the local market.",
    "The association media spokesman, Asoka Bandara, said the statement circulated on media platforms is incorrect.",
    "All milk powder brands, in response to the Trade Ministry\u2019s request to provide relief to consumers during the Avurudu season, have already reduced prices starting from April 1, with the current maximum retail price set at Rs. 1,050 for a 400-gram packet.",
    "Moreover, there are many milk powder brands that are sold at prices lower than this stipulated price, along with multiple price promotions. The Milk Powder Importers Association confirms that there will be no further reductions as of April 25, as misreported on Wednesday.",
    "Consumers can now find milk powder available in the market at a wide range of competitive prices and promotions, starting April 1.",
    "The association also said that they will take legal action against the member who made the false statement and inconvenienced the public."
