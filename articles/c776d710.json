    "Speaking at an event held to mark the 82nd birth anniversary of late Minister Gamini Dissanayake on Wednesday March 20, Wickremesinghe said the government\u2019s plan is to distribute some of the land to locals and part of it to agriculture corporations to develop the agrarian industry.",
    "The Mahaweli project is the largest multipurpose national development programme in the history of Sri Lanka, targeting hydroelectric power generation, flood control, irrigation for dry zone cultivation, settlement of landless and unemployed families by constructing and developing the physical and social infrastructure required for human habitation by using the waters of the Mahaweli river, Sri Lanka\u2019s longest flowing body of water. Increased agricultural production and employment generation were other objectives.",
    "President Wickremesinghe said that due to Sri Lanka\u2019s then-raging civil war, the A and B zones of the Mahaweli region could not be developed. (Colombo/Mar21/2024)"
