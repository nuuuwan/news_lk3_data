  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department(CID) of the Sri Lankan Police on Friday 22nd August 2025. Subsequently he was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate and remanded until  26  August 2025. 76 year old Wickremesinghe who has also  been sworn in as Prime Minister six times in the past became the first Sri Lankan ex-president to be arrested and remanded in the Island\u2019s history.",
    "The former President\u2019s health condition  worsened after being taken to the Magazine prison.He was moved  to the Welikade prison hosotal and transferred from there to the Colombo National Hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit there.  Consequently it was diagnosed that Wickremesinghe was suffering  from three blocked arteries, necrosis of heart tissues, diabetes, and a lung infection. These conditions  were not outwardly visible. He had been afflicted by heart ailments for the past seven years.",
    "When the case was taken up again at the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s court, Ranil Wickremesinghe was unable to attend court due to his health condition. The former President marked his presence in court through Zoom via Internet from his hospital bed at the National Hospital ICU.",
    "A panel of lawyers led by Former Attorney-General and EX-Minister Tilak Marapana and senior President\u2019s Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for Wickremesinghe appeared on behalf of Ranil and sought bail for the former President on health grounds. Medical reports pertaining to Wickremesinghe were submitted in detail to court.",
    "The Attorney-General\u2019s Department opposed the granting of bail to Wickremesinghe. Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris  reiterated in court that the \u201csuspect\u201dhad been charged under the Public Property Act and therefore bail could not be granted except under exceptional circumstances.",
    "Colombo Fort Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura after hearing both sides and examining the medical records granted bail to ex-president Ranil Wickremesinghe on three surety bails of Five million rupees each.  The case will be heard next on 29 October 2025.  The granting of bail was hailed with great joy by well-wishers and supporters of Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "The interrogation, arrest,remanding and release on bail of  former President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has caused much co excitement of a controversial nature.",
    "Ranil  Wickremesinghe had been earlier summoned on 19th September  by the CID  to record a statement  from him about his visit to the  Wolverhampton University in the United Kingdom (UK)  in September 2023 when he was  serving as head of state. President Wickremesinghe had accompanied his wife Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe for a ceremony  at the University where  Dr.Wickremesinghe  received an honorary Professorship.",
    "The then president Ranil Wickremesinghe and Forst  Lady Maithree Wickremesinghe had been formally invited for a celebratory  Graduation luncheon  at the Wolverhampton campus by the vice chancellor. The invitation was channelled through the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. It was then sent to the Sri Lankan Foreign ministry which forwarded it officially to the Presidential secretariat. The official  letter dated 1st September 2023 stated as follows \u2013",
    "\u201cOn behalf of the University of Wolverhampton\u2019s Chancellor, the Rt Hon Lord Swraj Paul of Marylebone, PC, The Board of Governors and the Academic Board, I am delighted to invite you to join the University for a special graduation luncheon on Friday 22nd of September 2023, at our Wolverhampton Campus.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis luncheon is part of the celebrations of Prof. Wickramasinghe\u2019s Honorary Professorship, and will take place in the build up to the graduation ceremony itself.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe graduation ceremony will commence at 14:30 in Wolverhampton, and we would be delighted if you are able to join us for the graduation luncheon, commencing at 12:00.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you are able to join Lord Paul for this celebratory day, please contact Terry Gibson, Head of Alumni & Development, by emailing T.Gibson@wlv.ac.uk or calling 07976 882 910. \u201c",
    "\u201cWe hope you can join us for this special luncheon as part of the celebrations.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe was questioned for several hours and had his statement recorded  about attending this luncheon.  He had denied any wrong doing and  provided detailed answers to allegations about misusing state funds on an overseas trip.Thereafter Wickremesinghe  was arrested on charges of abusing his powers by misusing  state funds and  taken to the Fort Magistrate\u2019s court where he was charged and remanded until the date of the next hearing on August 26. Wickremesinghe was charged   under Section 5(1) of the Public Property Act and Sections 386 and 388 of the Penal Code. The sum he is accused of having misappropriated is Rupees 16,644,652,21 or a little more than Rs 16.9 million.",
    "Prior to being taken away to the remand prison in a \u201cBlack Maria\u201d from the court premises, Wickremesinghe who is the United National Party(UNP) leader said \u201cI always worked for the nation. I did not get any  personal gain. The real face of the present administration has been uncovered.\u201d UNP Assistant Leader Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told the media, \u201cThis was what Ranil Wickremesinghe told us before he was arrested. He told me to record it and release it to the media,\u201d",
    "After being remanded on the 22nd, doctors examining Wickremesinghe at the Magazine prison found his blood sugar and blood pressure levels unstable and transferred him to the Welikade prison hospital. Permission was also granted for Wickremesinghe to receive home cooked meals on account of his ill-health. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and current opposition leader Sajith Premadasa visited  Wickremesinghe at the prison hos[ital separately on 23rd Morning.",
    "Speaking to the media after visiting Wickremesinghe at the Welikada Prison ,  Mahinda Rajapaksa said Ranil Wickremesinghe  was not shaken by the arrest.",
    "\u201cIn politics, we sometimes have to face these kinds of situations,\u201d Mahinda Rajapaksa stated . Mahinda  was critical of  the imprisonment of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and described  it as an act of political revenge.",
    "Mahinnda  said it was unfair to imprison political leaders, especially former Presidents, over minor incidents.\u201cThis is not right. It is wrong to imprison former Presidents who have held executive powers. Clearly, this is nothing more than an act of revenge by the present government,\u201d he said.Mahinda Rajapaksa also urged the media to question the government\u2019s actions and reflect public opinion.",
    "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa also met the media after visiting Wickremesinghe in hospital. Sajith remarked that  a  third party has interfervened  into the enforcement of the rule of law, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said today. Speaking further Sajith Premadasa said  \u201cA third party had actually predicted how the judiciary was going to act with regard to the case against the former President. How can such a thing take place when the Constitution is clear about how the rule of law should prevail,\u201d",
    "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa was referring  to the YouTuber Sudantha Thilakasiri, popularly known as \u201cSudaa\u201d who is regarded as being close to the ruling Janatha Vumukthi Paramuna (JVP)led National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government\u2019s upper echelons.",
    "According to media reports, Thilakasiri had in  a recent social media post,declared that if former President Wickremesinghe appeared before the CID on Friday (22) to give a statement, it would be \u201cmandatory\u201d for authorities to arrest him, produce him before court, and remand him for 14 days. He further claimed that if this did not happen, he would cease producing YouTube programmes.",
    "Condemning these remarks, Former Justice Minister and  President\u2019s Counsel Ali Sabry, in a Facebook message, described the prediction as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and indicative of a dangerous political culture.",
    "\u201cSuch actions reflect a disturbing trend of vindictive and destructive politics which undermines our institutions and our future. This cycle of hatred and retribution must end. Sri Lanka deserves a politics of reason, stability and gratitude to those who have time and again safeguarded the nation,\u201d Sabry said.",
    "Meanwhile there was a steep rise in the blood pressure and blood sugar levels  of Ranil in the afternoon. Doctors at the Prison hospital recommended urgent specialist attention. Thereafter the former President was transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) and admitted to the Emergency Treatment Unit(ETU) for further medical treatment. According to Hospital sources, Wickremesinghe  was  later placed in the Intensive Care Unit(ICU)  due to dehydration-related complications.",
    "A team of five specialist doctors examined the ex-president at the National Hospital.it was diagnosed that Wickremesinghe was suffering  from three blocked arteries, necrosis of heart tissues, diabetes, and a lung infection. These conditions  were not outwardly visible. He had been afflicted by heart ailments for the past seven years.",
    "An important question that arises is about the basis on which charges have been framed against former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Before delving into that area,it is important to re-visit an interesting incident that occurred in  the early part of March 2025. Ranil Wickremesinghe  was  interviewed by British journalist Mehdi Hasan for the \u201cHead to Head\u201dshow on Al-Jazeerah TV. Ranil Wickremesinghe  was virtually pilloried on the program that appeared to be more of an inquisition than an interview.",
    "One of the questions raised by Hasan was about the  infamous Batalanda Commssion report. Wickremesinghe messed up things for himself by first denying the existence of such a report.When a copy of the report was produced ,a sheepish Wickremesinghe retorted feebly that the report was never tabled in Parliament.In fact, it was!",
    "The TV show created a furore in Sri Lanka. The JVP under the leadership of Rohana Wijeweera had launched its second insurrection from  the years 1987 to 1990 against the state. The JVP functioning under the label of Deshapremi Janatha Vyaparaya(DJV) unleashed  terrible  violence. The then UNP government of President Ranasinghe  Premadasa had cracked down hard. The revolt was suppressed brutally. Thousands of youths aligned or suspected of being aligned to the JVP were killed or made to disappear. Thousands were incarcerated and tortured.",
    "Among the detention cum torture camps set up by the state the detention centre at Batalanda acquired tremendous notoriety. This detention centre  was located in the housing complex of the state fertilizer corporation at  Batalanda which was in the Biyagama electoral division. Ranil Wickremesinghe had been elected to Parliament from the Biyagama electorate in 1977. Ranil had reportedly played a part in acquiring buildings from the Batalanda housing complex to set up the centre.",
    "Wickremesinghe however had no involvement in what transpired at the detention centre. The Batalanda camp acquired a horrible image as a hellhole of torture and unofficial execution. Wickremesinghe\u2019s political opponents of different hues tried to portray him as being directly involved in the torture. Some even dubbed him as the \u201cBatalanda Butcher\u201d.",
    "When Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga became President in 1994, she set  up a number of commissions of inquiry.One of these was on the Batalanda detention centre.  There was much speculation then that President Kumaratunga had set up the Batalanda commission of inquiry to \u201cfix\u201dher chief political rival Wickremesinghe. The Commission however could not find any evidence incriminating Wickremesinghe with torture activity at Batalanda.",
    "This however  did not deter Wickremesinghe\u2019s political adversaries or critics from raising the Batalanda bogey against him occasionally. So when Batalanda figured in the Al Jazeera TV show and Ranil was seen as trying to bluff his way out, the controversy erupted again. The JVP whose members and supporters were the alleged victims of Batalanda was expected to mete out justice to the alleged perpetrators. The JVP breakaway group Frontline Socialist Party(FSP)raised the issue and dared the JVP Govt to take action over Batalanda and by extension Wickremesinghe. Cabinet minister Bimal Rathnayaka announced that Wickremesinghe would soon be prosecuted.Several other JVP stalwarts made ominous remarks that Ranil would soon be penalised for his alleged offences in the past.",
    "The JVP led NPP Govt then tried to rake up the Batalanda issue again. There was much pressure on the leadership from the rank and file. There was even hope in some JVP circles that Wickremesinghe could be penalised over Batalanda. A debate was held in Parliament on Batalanda.It soon became apparent that the move to raise the spectre of Batalanda after 35 years was going to be counterproductive.  The opposition began to speak about the brutalities of the JVP during the insurgency in Parliament.",
    "Even though the cadres of the JVP were cruelly massacred by the agents of the Sri Lankan state, the JVP hands were not clean either.During the  three-year period from 1987 to 1990, 487 public servants, 342 policemen, 209 security personnel, 16 political leaders, and 4,945 civilians of other descriptions were said to have been killed by the JVP. This tally included 30 Buddhist monks, two Catholic priests, 52 school principals, four medical doctors, 18 estate superintendents and 27 trade unionists. It also includes family members of 93 policemen and 69 servicemen.",
    "The JVP bigwigs realised the wisdom  of the adage \u201cseeking justice with clean hands\u201d. When efforts to  expose  the Batalanda horrors were undertaken, the causes that led to such cruelty would also be focused upon. Memories of the JVP\u2019s past atrocities would be resurrected. The JVP had used the NPP Camouflage to make the people forget negative aspects of the past and look forward to a positive future.Now there was a danger of people remembering the \u201cold\u201dJVP and its violent  history.",
    "And so the plans of reviving the Batalanda bogey and penalising Wickremesinghe were aborted.The hate and resentment towards the great \u201cClass enemy\u201dRanil Wickremesinghe  however   continued to exist in the hearts and minds of some crimson comrades. The JVP for many years had epitomised Ranil as the \u201cevil elite\u201d.Being ensconced in the seat of power,it was possible  now for the JVP  to explore other avenues to teach lessons to their political opponents if they so desired.",
    "In late June 2025, the CID  informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court that a special inquiry into an overseas trip by  former president  Ranil Wickremesinghe  was underway. The objective was to ascertain  whether the trip  was  funded  unlawfully with public money. The CID probe commenced following an official complaint by  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s secretary Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake on 23 May 2025,  after an internal inquiry at the presidential secretariat.",
    "CID officials  filed  a  B-report in court with the  details of the progress of the inquiry. The B-report alleged that former president Ranil Wickremesinghe  had siphoned off state funds to defray the expenses of a private trip to London in September 2023, covering it up   as part of an official tour.It was stated   that Wickremesinghe travelled to Britain on September 22\u201323, 2023, to attend his wife\u2019s PhD graduation ceremony at the University of Wolverhampton.",
    "The  B- report alleges that  the UK  visit was not official. It was incorporated  as part of then president  Wickremesinghe\u2019s official visit to  Cuba and the USA. Ranil Wickremesinghe had gone   to Britain only to attend the private event.However he was accompanied by a team of officials and security personnel in Britain also.",
    "The line of inquiry  followed by the CID  was  that the expenditure incurred by the team of officials and security personnel who  accompanied Wickremesinghe to Britain had cost over  Rs. 16.6 million. The amount was  for  airfare, accommodation, and related expenses. The CID opined  that the London leg of Wickremesinghe\u2019s 2023 trip  was  of  a personal nature allegedly  funded by Sri Lankan taxpayers. It was  alleged  that charging the personal visit to  official expenditure  amounted to an abuse of presidential powers  for private benefit and a violation of Sri Lankan laws relating to corruption and misuse of Govt resources.",
    "The CID also questioned former presidential secretary Saman Ekanayake and Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s  private secretary Sandra Perera in early August . Both were directly involved in making arrangements for  and  authorizing the 2023  UK  visit.Their statements about expenses incurred by the trip  were  duly recorded.",
    "Following this, the CID on Sep 19  summoned Ranil Wickremesinghe for questioning. On August 22, 2025, the former president arrived at CID headquarters in Colombo  to provide a statement regarding the disputed trip. His lawyers had advised him of a possible arrest after the statement was recorded.After several hours of questioning, Wickremesinghe was placed under arrest in the  afternoon of  August 22nd.",
    "Wickremesinghe was then taken in a Black Maria  to the Colombo Fort  Magistrate\u2019s court and formally charged Section 5(1) of the Public Property Act and Sections 386 and 388 of the Penal Code. The prosecution read out a 30 Page First Information Report outlining the history and details of the offences allegedly committed by Wickremesinghe. The A-G dept also provided a list of 38  potential witnesses from whom testimonies had been recorded during the course of the investigation. These include persons who accompanied Wickremesinghe on his UK visit and past and present officials of the Presidential secretariat.",
    "Thereafter  President\u2019s Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appearing for  Ranil Wickremesinghe presented his arguments before court. Premaratne also  sought bail for the former President.  Premaratne PC  in his plea for bail said \u201cthe suspect is 76 years old, suffering from heart disease for seven years, as well as diabetes and hypertension. His wife is a cancer patient. They have no children and depend solely on each other\u201d.Granting bail was opposed by the prosecution.",
    "Incidently a large number of politicians from different parties and people from different walks of life converged at the court premises in sympathy, solidarity and support for Wickremesinghe.",
    "Court proceedings  regarding Wickremesinghe\u2019s bail application were inordinately delayed due to an unexpected 30 minute recess  announced by the magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura. Subsequently there was a 30  minute power black -out. Although  court was expected to resume before 7 PM,there was two hour delay because the  magistrate arrived only at 9.30 PM.Ultimately Wickremesinghe was denied bail and remanded until the 25th.",
    "The former President\u2019s health condition  worsened after being taken to the Magazine prison.He was taken to the Welikade prison hosotal and transferred from there to the Colombo National Hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit there.",
    "After news of Wickremesinghe\u2019s arrest became known, Public  Security Minister Ananda Wijepala  claimed  that the action taken by the law enforcement authorities  was  in accordance with keeping the promises the government had given to the people.",
    "\u201cOur government pledged to bring all wrongdoers before justice, regardless of the positions they held,\u201d  Minister Wijepala told  Parliament.",
    "This then is  how a former  Sri Lankan President  was arrested,Indicted, remanded and released on bail for the first time in  Sri Lanka. When JR Jayewardene introduced the executive presidency to the country, there was  Constitutional immunity for the president over acts of omission and commission  during his or her tenure. It was the 19th Constitutional amendment enacted by the govt of President Maithripala Sirisena that curtailed this presidential immunity.It was Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister who was primarily responsible for the 19th amendment to the Constitution. It is indeed ironic that Wickremesinghe is today the first president to be arrested and detained due to  the curtailing of presidential immunity.",
    "TAILPIECE: On 26 August 2025,  Colombo Fort Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura granted bail to ex-president Ranil Wickremesinghe on three surety bails of Five million rupees each.  The case will be heard next on 29 October 2025.",
