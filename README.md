### Britain to roll out red carpet, royal fanfare for Trump visit

United States President Donald Trump will arrive in Britain on Tuesday (Sep 16) for a three-day trip.

An elaborate show of pomp and pageantry awaits the American leader during his historic second state visit, as the United Kingdom spares no effort to charm its most unpredictable transatlantic guest.

The last time Trump visited the storied Windsor Castle was for tea with the late Queen Elizabeth II, during his first term in office in 2019.

This time, he will be hosted to a state banquet by King Charles III at the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his country estate.

It is unusual for non-royals to receive the full ceremony of a second state visit, rendering Trump’s invitation a striking exception.

Analysts said Starmer is hoping the display of royal flattery for the US president – Trump has long expressed a fascination with the royal family – will help keep UK-US ties on a friendly footing.

### Sri Lanka eyes 6% growth in 2026, but 2025 outlook dims amid spending delays: Dy Minister

Sri Lanka is aiming to boost its economic growth to up to 6% in 2026, partly through record government capital expenditure, though delays in passing the budget could drag on its performance this year, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha Fernando said.

Deputy Minister Anil Jayantha said Sri Lankans and investors should be “hopeful” as the country climbs out of the economic crisis that hit in 2022, its worst since independence.

Sri Lanka recorded economic growth of 5% in 2024. That would likely slow to 4% to 4.5% this year, as delays in passing the budget slowed government spending, Fernando told Reuters in an interview.

“Next year ... we will need to go for 5 to 6% growth. We will aim for that,” he said. “In the long run, after five years, we target to maintain an average GDP growth that emerging countries are maintaining. That is around 6 to 7%.”

Nepal’s deadliest protests in decades erupted just as the country entered its peak tourist season, dealing a blow to businesses that had been preparing to welcome trekkers from around the globe to experience its world-famous trails.

Nepal’s tourism authority, hotel owners and trek organisers said arrivals had fallen by 30% from this time last year, leading to bookings being cancelled.

“I am sitting outside idle because there are no tourists ... Many groups have cancelled in September,” said 49-year-old Ram Chandra Giri, who arranges trekking expeditions and owns a Japanese restaurant.

### H’tota house seized for alleged ‘Ice’ production

The Kalutara District Crimes Division yesterday uncovered a house in Mayurapura, Hambantota, allegedly used by underworld figures ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’ and ‘Kudu Nilanga’ to manufacture the drug ‘Ice.’

Police said the search of the house uncovered 52 litres of chemicals suspected to be used in producing Ice. One room had been set up as a laboratory, containing four white iron cauldrons, six plastic buckets, and other equipment believed to be linked to narcotics production. A vehicle allegedly used to transport the drugs was also seized. Investigations show it is registered to an organised criminal residing overseas and had previously been in police custody before being released.

Earlier this month, sleuths seized about 50,000kg of chemicals at a residence in Thalawa, Middeniya, suspected to be used for Ice production. Tests by the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board confirmed that 17 of 20 samples taken contained substances used to manufacture methamphetamine.

### Hakeem calls out Govt.’s Israel foreign policy stance

Slams Govt. statement on Israel’s Qatar strikes as apathetic, one-sided, distorted

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader MP Rauff Hakeem yesterday accused the Government of shielding Israel in its foreign policy, saying the Foreign Ministry’s statement on the recent attack on Qatar downplayed Israeli aggression, ignored international law, and risked undermining Sri Lanka’s ties with key Gulf partners.

“At the time of Israel’s recent attack on Qatar, I was in Tehran, Iran, attending the World Islamic Solidarity Conference on Palestine, which was attended by representatives from more than 50 countries.

While returning from there, I came across a statement issued by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs following Israel’s attack on Qatar.

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry has demonstrated once again not just how incapable it is or distinguishing between an occupier and the occupied, or between an air attack and an incident, or even worse, between a mercenary behaviour and solidarity with victims.

### North, East and West: Navigating  Sri Lanka’s compass in new world order

The IMF senior mission chief Peter Breuer, presenting the approval of the third review of Sri Lanka’s $ 2.9 b bailout (Source: Al Jazeera)

When the National People’s Power (NPP) Government assumed office in September 2024, it inherited more than a fragile economy and the hopes of a disillusioned citizenry. It also assumed responsibility for steering Sri Lanka through arguably the most significant moment of international recalibration since the end of the Cold War. The global order is shifting once again, with China and Russia presenting themselves as alternatives to Western dominance, and smaller states forced to reposition themselves in ways that are both delicate and strategic.

Signals of a profound reordering of the international system have been apparent for some time. Early indications of this impending shift can be, perhaps, traced to the rise of far-right nationalism and systemic dissatisfaction that emerged in many parts of the world over the past decade.
