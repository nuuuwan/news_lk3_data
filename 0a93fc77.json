    "India has outlawed the export of non-basmati white rice in an attempt to ward off looming domestic price spikes.",
    "Heavy rains have hurt crops in the country and rice prices have risen by more than 11% over the last 12 months. Non-basmati white grain currently accounts for about a quarter of India\u2019s rice exports, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs said as it announced the policy change.",
    "Experts warned the move could push up global food prices. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this will have quite an impact on global food prices,\u201d said Emma Wall, head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown.",
    "India is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of rice, accounting for more than 40% of global shipments. Non-basmati rice is mainly exported to countries in Asia and Africa.",
    "Last year, the Indian government imposed a 20% export tax to try to discourage foreign sales. It has also limited wheat and sugar shipments.",
    "But exporting can be more lucrative for Indian farmers than selling domestically. The government said that farmers would still be able to export other kinds of rice, including long-grain basmati, ensuring they \u201cget the benefit of remunerative prices in the international market\u201d.",
    "The state will also consider requests to allow shipments to other countries based on food security needs, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade said.",
