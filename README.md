The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel ‚Äúshow their willingness‚Äù to negotiate.

It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza.

Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas‚Äôs political office in Doha ‚Äúno longer serves its purpose‚Äù were ‚Äúinaccurate‚Äù.

‚ÄúQatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,‚Äù a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.

‚ÄúQatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.‚Äù

### Why should women represent Parliament?

Women underrepresented in Sri Lanka's Parliament despite being majority of population. Low female MP percentages (less than 6%) since 1989. Experts argue women's voices crucial for addressing gender-specific issues, economic challenges, and social inequalities. Increased female representation needed to create more inclusive policies benefiting both genders.

üü©

Women are the top of Sri Lanka in the top of Sri Lanka as the population, voter percentage and literacy.

However, there is no percentage of women agents exceeding 6% in Parliament regarding citizens.

In this year's general election, there was no talk about women's nominations, but in some districts, some parties or independent groups are not included in the nomination list.

Why do women in politics make a terrible blasphemy?

At a time of the general election, BBC was looking for as a percentage of women should be in Parliament.

In 1931, with Sri Lanka to be elected elections, women have the right to vote.

Accordingly, the first legislature of the Sangege elections, the first legislature of the Ruwanwella elected to the Ruwanwella electorate, is elected to its first legislature in Sri Lanka.

Since then, the first elections in 1989 had been represented in the 1989 elections for the proportional representation.

This is not meant to be a history of the colonial years, but rather a cherry-picking of childhood memories for their quaintness rather than for their historical truth, for socio-cultural insights rather than for historical facts. I can only touch on some cultural oddities of the English-speaking middleclass of those times, since I knew no other. Likewise, I can write only of the last years of colonial rule, since I lived through no others. I write as ‚Äòan old man in a hurry‚Äô, because at the age of 88 years, I doubt that there will be others left to recount these tales.

### MONKS IN CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS

Whether the participation of monks in representative politics is permissible (or proper), has been a matter of periodic discourse in the media.

In preparing this note, I can claim no expertise (nor authority), on the discipline or set of rules for the Maha Sangha. Incidentally, I personally prefer to be considered as ‚Äúone who seeks to follow the Dhamma,‚Äù rather than as a ‚ÄúBuddhist‚Äù.

The ordained ones have themselves chosen to enter the Community referred to collectively as ‚ÄúThe (Maha) Sangha‚Äù They have voluntarily resolved to abandon the lay life and to observe the rules of conduct (more than two hundred), included in the Vinaya Pitaka.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the ‚Äúforest dweller‚Äù (vanavasa) tradition prevails, where the monk lives alone, often in a natural cave, and devotes himself to continuous meditation and solitude, with minimum contact with others. In the commoner monastic tradition, a community of monks live together, with each engaging in his own spiritual practices.
