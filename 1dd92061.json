    "The chief organiser of the Paris Olympics Tony Estanguet admitted on Tuesday that the 12 months until the opening ceremony would be \u201cdifficult\u201d.",
    "Estanguet said though that there was no need to sound the alarm on the key issues of transport and security, despite several days of rioting and looting that rocked France this month.",
    "\u201cWe know that the last year will be decisive, it won't be simple... it will be a crazy year, a difficult year.",
    "\u201cBut we have to stay calm,\u201d he said at a press conference in Paris as the one-year--to-go date of July 26 approaches fast.",
    "Despite the violence that flared in France after a 17-year-old was shot dead by police at a traffic stop, Estanguet said the issue of security was in hand.",
    "International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said on Tuesday he was sure the Paris Olympics would take place \u201cin a peaceful environment\u201d, even though much of the trouble flared in parts of the French capital where Games events will take place next year.",
    "Bach told reporters in a media roundtable that the IOC sympathised with those affected by the violence, \u201cAt the same time we can note that these riots were not related to the Olympic Games in any respect,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe can feel the great support of the French people for these Olympic Games. So we are very confident that the Games can and will happen in a peaceful environment,\u201d Bach added.",
    "In Paris, Estanguet said the issue of transport, which the French national spending watchdog has frequently warned is a concern, \u201cis heading in the right direction\u201d.",
    "The contracts for bus transport for competitors and accredited officials have been allocated, for example.",
    "\u201cThat gives me a lot of satisfaction, even if we still have a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d he said.",
    "Estanguet said the first two phases of ticket sales -- criticised at times for prices that reached nearly 700 euros ($775) for athletics sessions -- had yielded one billion euros out of a target of 1.4 billion euros.",
    "The organising committee was shaken last month when police raided its offices and the homes of two officials,Chief Executive Officer Etienne Thobois and Edouard Donnelly, the executive director of operations.",
    "Prosecutors are investigating the contracts awarded for the Games and potential conflicts of interest.",
    "Estanguet said he had \u201cno new information\u201d and that he and his colleagues were continuing to cooperate with investigators.",
    "The Paris Olympics open on July 26 2024 and run until August 11 followed by the Paralympics from August 28 to September 8. (AFP)"
