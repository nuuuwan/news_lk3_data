The ecosystem built around these vehicles has created significant employment, giving rise and impetus to local industries,\u201d Dissanayake added.",
    "DPMC\u2019s roots date back to 1985 when Richard Pieris Motor Company was incorporated. After a management buyout in January 1994, the name was changed to David Pieris Motor Company and operation commenced with just 195 employees. Today the single entity company has grown to be a leading diversified conglomerate comprising of 22 companies with business interests in Automotive, Financial Services, Real Estate and Investment Property Development, Logistics and Warehouse Operations, Shipping and Marine Services, Information Communication Technologies, Racing and Leisure, Solar and Distribution of Electronic and Electric Consumer Durables.",
    "Being the sole distributor in Sri Lanka, DPMC transformed Bajaj into more than just a brand, making it a household name and a market leader for motorcycles and three-wheelers with over three million vehicles sold. Over the years, the company has grown considerably, marking many firsts and milestones including introducing Europe\u2019s No. 1 bike, KTM, Sri Lanka\u2019s first automated conveyorised, ISO-certified vehicle manufacturing and assembly facility with an output of 1,000 vehicles every day. More recently they launched the first motorcycle under the locally value-added program and registered Sri Lanka\u2019s first converted electric three-wheeler. The company\u2019s success can be attributed to their commitment to their customers through island wide accessibility and a strong emphasis on after sales care through seven regional offices and over 1,700 connected sales, service and spare part dealers.",
    "DPMC has been a catalyst in driving social and economic growth and empowering millions of lives by enabling empowerment, self-employment, and entrepreneurship. Instrumental in launching Sri Lanka\u2019s very first women technical training program, the company continues to support the communities in which it operates through CSR initiatives in the areas such as education, environment, health, water and sanitation, and sports."
