    "Sri Lanka has no immediate plans to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from India, as the required infrastructure including storage facilities is yet to be built, the country\u2019s energy minister said on Tuesday.",
    "India announced last year it would supply LNG to Sri Lanka\u2019s power plants and work on cross-border energy connectivity, including a petroleum pipeline and power grid link.",
    "\u201cWe have to first build the storage facility. Construction has not commenced yet,\u201d said Sri Lanka\u2019s energy minister Kumara Jayakody, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of Confederation of Indian Industry\u2019s energy summit in New Delhi.",
    "Sri Lanka is yet to finalise the LNG contract procurement with India, he said.",
    "The minister said it would take at least three years to complete construction of the storage infrastructure, and imports would begin only after that.",
    "While discussions to build storage had taken place under the previous government, no contracts have been finalised, he added.",
    "\u201cWe are studying the earlier content, deciding the location, and evaluating the loan and pricing aspects,\u201d Jayakody said.",
    "Indian state-run firm Petronet LNG had last year signed a deal to supply LNG to Sri Lankan engineering firm LTL Holdings\u2019 power plants in Colombo.",
    "The minister said both countries have formed a team and are working on submitting prospective reports about the planned work of developing a cross-border transmission system from southern India to the island\u2019s north."
