    "The Opposition has handed over its no-faith motion against Deputy Minister of Defence Maj. Gen. (retd.) Aruna Jayasekera to Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne. It insists that Jayasekera, as the Security Forces Commander of the Eastern Province in 2019, failed to prevent the Easter Sunday terrorist bombings carried out by the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ), which was based in the East, and therefore it is not possible to conduct an impartial probe into the terror attacks while he is functioning as the Deputy Minister of Defence.",
    "The JVP-led NPP has a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and therefore the no-faith motion against Jayasekera has no chance of passage. However, the Opposition will be able to make the government either defend Jayasekera or ask him to resign as the Deputy Minister of Defence. The SJB and its allies have built a strong case against Jayasekera, and it will be a huge political gamble for the government to throw its weight behind him. The Catholic Church has also expressed serious concern about his holding the post of Deputy Defence Minister during investigations into the Easter Sunday terror attacks. So, the government finds itself in a dilemma. It cannot throw Jayasekera to the wolves by asking him to resign, for such action will amount to a victory for the Opposition.",
    "A parliamentary debate on the no-faith motion is the last thing the government wants, for the Opposition will have a field day flogging issues, including an alleged deal, in the Vakarai Pradeshiya Sabha, between the NPP and the TMVP led by S. Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan, whom the government has sought to implicate in the Easter Sunday terror attacks and, worse, the fact that Mohamed Ibrahim, father of two suicide bombers, who also funded the NTJ terror project, was one of the JVP\u2019s National List candidates in the 2015 general election. Making matters worse for the NPP, the Catholic Church has said that since Jayasekera holds the post of Deputy Defence Minister, there may be political interference in the ongoing investigations and their credibility will suffer. The same holds true for Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security, former SDIG Ravi Seneviratne and the CID Director former SSP Shani Abeysekera. Seneviratne was the SDIG in charge of the CID and Abeysekera was the Director of the CID at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks, and they too have been blamed for the CID\u2019s failure to prevent the carnage.",
    "The SJB ought to ask itself whether its leaders have any moral right to condemn others for failure to prevent the Easter Sunday terror attacks. The SJB leaders were members of the UNP-led Yahapalana government, which the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that probed the Easter Sunday terror attacks has held accountable. The commission report says, \u201cThe dysfunctional Government was a major contributory factor for the events that took place on 21st April 2019. The Government including President [Maithripala] Sirisena and Prime Minister [Ranil Wickremesinghe] is accountable for the tragedy.\u201d (pp. 470-71) The SJB leaders, while in their UNP days, campaigned hard for Sirisena in the 2015 presidential race, and fought quite a battle to prevent the ouster of PM Wickremesinghe during what came to be dubbed the 2018 constitutional coup. Therefore, before moving the no-faith motion against Jayasekera, the holier-than-thou SJB seniors should apologise to the public for their contribution to the Yahapalana government\u2019s lapses that led to the Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "Meanwhile, a defining feature of high-profile criminal investigations in this country is a severe lack of credibility and integrity due to political interference. The probes into the Easter Sunday attacks should be conducted by a group of truly independent investigators who are not among those accused of having failed to prevent the 2019 carnage if they are to be considered credible. They will be dismissed as political witch-hunts if they are conducted by a team of prejudiced investigators, however efficient they may be, and seen to be aimed at proving some preconceived conclusions.",
