An international war crimes prosecutor said on Tuesday that evidence emerging from mass grave sites in Syria has exposed a state-run “machinery of death” under toppled leader Bashar al-Assad in which he estimated more than 100,000 people were tortured and murdered since 2013.

Speaking after visiting two mass grave sites in the towns of Qutayfah and Najha near Damascus, former U.S. war crimes ambassador at large Stephen Rapp told Reuters: “We certainly have more than 100,000 people that were disappeared into and tortured to death in this machine.

“I don’t have much doubt about those kinds of numbers given what we’ve seen in these mass graves.”

“We really haven’t seen anything quite like this since the Nazis,” said Rapp, who led prosecutions at the Rwanda and Sierra Leone war crimes tribunals and is working with Syrian civil society to document war crimes evidence and is helping to prepare for any eventual trials.

### Yukthi outraged by extractive external debt restructuring agreement

If the current Government is truly committed to providing social welfare and addressing the needs of the people suffering the most, it must avoid future borrowings in the capital markets

Following is a statement by Yukthi, calling for economic policies that lead to a process of sustainable development that uplifts working people. It opposes a return to high-interest international capital markets, which have already created an intolerable burden for the people

On 13 December 2024, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance announced the “successful expiration of its consent solicitation and exchange offer related to its international sovereign bonds.” The initial proposal for a deal had been concluded during a blackout period two days before the Presidential election that was held on 21 September 2024. It is a disastrous agreement that has been forced upon Sri Lanka. It will cost the country billions of dollars and it will likely lead to repeated cycles of default in the near future.

### Violating people’s sovereignty

*2024-12-18 05:16:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Violating-people-s-sovereignty/4-770658) · `en`

Unfortunately, Sri Lanka’s legislators have contrived to adversely impact on the peoples’ rights especially when it comes to the electoral process

Sri Lanka’s citizenry is in a way fortunate that there is a written down constitution – a variety of benefits behold its citizenry. Successive political legislators have however, contrived to be guilty of violating the rights of the people – when it comes to elections.

A written down constitution like Sri Lanka has, offers plenty of balance and equity for all:

A written constitution provides a clear and definite framework for government structure, powers, and limitations. It outlines the rights of citizens and the responsibilities of the government that is easily accessible and understood by all.

Our constitution includes rights that guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms for citizens. This protects individuals from potential abuses of power by the government and ensures that rights are upheld and respected.

### National security only through national harmony – a response

Who deprived the equal rights of Tamils? Not the Sinhalese but the Vellala Tamils themselves

Capt. (Rtd) Rajaratne has written the above article, appeared in Daily FT on 6 December 2024 (https://www.ft.lk/columns/National-security-only-through-national-harmony/4-770154).

Rajaratne implies that the Tamils are subjected to inequality, injustice, oppression, marginalisation, and deprivation. The commemoration of the dead LTTE cadre in the north, he says, was a stark indictment of the failures of the successive Governments to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, liberation, inclusivity, and opportunity.

The above article, in its entirety, is an attempt to convince the reader that Tamils in Sri Lanka are discriminated against and their grievances are not addressed properly. The above implication, which is far from truth, is exactly what the separatists want the world to know to justify their claim for a federal/independent state.

The Court of Appeal has ordered that a petition challenging the Parliamentary seat of Jaffna District Independent Group MP Ramanathan Archchuna be considered on 15 January. The petition seeks a writ of certiorari to nullify his position as a Member of Parliament.

### We make a decision to insult religious traditions

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



PM Harini Amarasuriya criticizes cremation policy as unjust to religions & families. She vows to prevent similar decisions affecting religious traditions.

🟩

Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya told Parliament yesterday (17) that the injustice inflicted on religious traditions and mothers could never be justified by cremation of the victims of the infection.

The resolution of the last government is not in any way justified. It is a resolution of the most sensitive and most cruel. The family is able to express their grief and reduce grief through the customs that are fulfilled after a death. That is why it has been given religious values.

Such traditions are very important in the uncertainty like the Kovit infection. In this case, such a terrible decision cannot be allowed in any way. Politics or any other reason for that is not valid. It is unreasonable to make such a decision without scientific basis. Therefore, our government will never make any resolution that will cause such suffering to any sect or to insult religious traditions.

However, the National People's Power has said that it will not have any contact with India regarding the petroleum pipe.. Similarly, it was reported that the power was not connected.

But now we know that the government has agreed to these two issues. Our position is to take place. We do not say that the consensus of the Monetary Fund is like that. Instead, I should make amendments to it and go ahead.
