According to the police, the same-sex couple had disappeared from their homes around a month ago. Their husbands reported their disappearance to both Kandana and Wattala Police, providing photos of the two women to all police stations. Meanwhile, a vigilant police officer at Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy spotted two women fitting the description of the missing individuals during a visit today. Subsequently, Kandy Police took them into custody and interrogated them, discovering that they had been residing at a guest house in the Suduhumpola area of Kandy.",
