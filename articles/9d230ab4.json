    "The Hafez Centre for Cultural Understanding (HCCU) of the Pathfinder Foundation and the Governance and Policy Think Tank (GPTT) of Sharif University in Iran recently held their inaugural webinar on the theme \u2018Iran-Sri Lanka Relations: Ties of the Past, Pointers to the Future.\u2019",
    "In Session 1, Peradeniya University Head of the Department of History Professor Rohitha Dassayanke, examined the historical context of Sri Lanka\u2019s relations, beginning with the Sassanian Empire as far back as the 2nd century B.C., which controlled the western end of the Silk Road across Central Asia. Sri Lanka served as an entrep\u00f4t for trade between the Persian Empire and China and Southeast Asia. There is historical reference to a Persian ambassador being present at the Royal Court of Anuradhapura in the 5th century A.D., while documented evidence records the discovery of Persian silver Larins, or fish-hook coins, in Sri Lanka. Additionally, a Partho-Sassanian pitcher was found in Jetavanarama in Anuradhapura, and a large quantity of Sassanian-Islamic ceramicware has been discovered at the ancient port of Mantai.",
    "Session 2 focused on contemporary Iran-Sri Lanka ties. Panellists included the Foreign Affairs Ministry Ambassador Vipulatheja Wishvanath Aponsu, former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Iran the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ambassador (Retd.) Abdul-Reza Faraji Rad, former Iranian Ambassador to Sri Lanka General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University visiting Lecturer in International Relations Dr. Zameer Careem, the Iranian Navy Director of Strategic Studies, Captain Qasem Abbasian, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry Ambassador (Retd.) former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Iran M.M.

    "Session 3 focused on future bilateral relations. Panellists noted that the partnership between Sri Lanka and Iran should transcend formal agreements, reflecting centuries of shared experiences.
