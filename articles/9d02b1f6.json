    "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday arrested former Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) Director and Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Neville de Silva over allegations of abduction and unlawful imprisonment.",
    "The arrest follows an investigation initiated after a Fundamental Rights petition was filed in the Supreme Court by a resident of Kuruwita, Ratnapura. The petitioner accused CCD officers of coercing him into handing over his property and money to a gold businessman from Nugegoda as part of a settlement for a financial dispute arising from a failed joint venture.",
    "The case dates back to May 2023 when a millionaire businessman from Nugegoda lodged a complaint with then Western Province Senior DIG Deshabandu Thennakoon, alleging that a business partner had defrauded him of Rs. 240 million. The man, a businessman from Kuruwita, had reportedly promised to set up a gem mining business but had since evaded contact. Following the complaint, the case was handed over to the CCD. CCD officers conducted investigations, including phone analyses, and arrested the suspect in Kuruwita. During questioning, the suspect admitted to receiving money from the complainant, part of which had been spent. He also disclosed selling a valuable gemstone in Beruwala to repay the debt.",
    "Subsequently, both parties had been brought in for mediation by the CCD where they agreed on a settlement, which included signing a legal agreement. The accused had also handed over a van as partial payment, with the remaining amount to be paid in instalments. Based on the mutual settlement, the CCD, led by de Silva, had decided not to pursue further legal action, concluding their investigation.",
    "However, the suspect had later filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court, alleging that CCD officers had used undue pressure to force him into the settlement. A copy of the petition was also sent to the Inspector General of Police (IGP).",
    "As a result of the petition and subsequent inquiries, de Silva was arrested by CID investigators yesterday."
