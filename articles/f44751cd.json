Concerns at the briefing held on 22 May were specifically highlighted regarding the deployment of numerous human rights abusers from Bangladesh.",
    "In response UN Spoke-sperson Stephane Dujarric confirmed that the UN is aware of the documentary. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve seen the documentary and as you know, our colleagues in the peacekeeping department have been interacting and gave a statement to the producers,\u201d Dujarric said.

    "He acknowledged that over the years, there have been instances where allegations of past human rights violations committed by uniformed personnel from a few countries were brought to the UN\u2019s attention. He said in such cases, the peacekeeping department takes appropriate action following their screening policy and other relevant frameworks.",
