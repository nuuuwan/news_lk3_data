  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Customs is waiting to test the motor of a BYD vehicle to check the actual wattage, an official told a parliament panel, in the latest development after around 1,000 vehicles were detained over a disputed power of a motor.",
    "The agents for BYD have yet not delivered a motor which Customs wanted to test at Sri Lanka\u2019s Moratuwa University, Customs spokesman Seevali Arukgoda told the Committee of Public Finance of the parliament.",
    "The investigation was started after several persons from the industry provided information and the Deputy Minister of Finance also gave additional information, Arukgoda said.",
    "\u201cThey have said the motor has to be removed from the car, there is a way to do it, and experts have to come,\u201d Arukgoda said. \u201cThere is a delay on their part.\u201d",
    "The John Keells company has said they recommended some international labs, but the usual practice at Sri Lanka Customs on technical matters was to refer them to Moratuwa University, he said.",
    "COPF chairman Harsha de Silva said it was his advice to get an internationally accepted entity to check the motor.",
    "\u201cThis is an international problem. This is connected to China,\u201d de Silva. \u201cThese vehicles are built in China. Earlier in this committee itself there was a dispute over fertilizer. Then there were tests in Sri Lanka and in Singapore. Eventually Sri Lanka had to pay damages.",
    "\u201cSo don\u2019t fall in well we fell in the night in the day time. My belief is that we should have an internationally accepted lab to do it.\u201d",
    "The vehicle is said to have a motor whose output is limited to 100kW conform lower tax brackets given to lower performance cars.",
    "Committee member Ravi Karunanayake said had read in the media that the procedure was accepted in Nepal and Singapore.",
    "\u201cThey have given such an information,\u201d Arukgoda said. \u00a0\u201cOur main concern is to get the correct technical specifications to us. In submitting that there is an issue.",
    "\u201cThere has been no dispute there as far as I know. \u00a0But the problem is if the 150kw motor is there, and it is downgraded by software, for Customs purposes we will have to go by 150kW because of the capacity.\u201d",
    "Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe said customs was taking the advice of the Moratuwa University which had the highest technology capable team.",
    "\u201cAs long as it is internationally accepted. This is a matter between two countries. So don\u2019t create a problem with another country,\u201d de Silva said.",
    "\u201cIt does not matter whether it is John Keells or not. If Moratuwa University is internationally accredited there will be no problem. But if not there will be a problem. \u00a0That is our advice.\u201d",
    "\u201cI think it is commendable that there is an investigation taking place,\u201d Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said.",
    "\u201cWhen there is an issue, we are intervening into it. I think the discussion is \u201clet\u2019s do it right.\u201d",
