    "With President Trump now engaged in renaming various parts of the world after the name of the land he rules with an iron Sharpie, it may be interesting to consider what else he has achieved in the first 100-days of his second term.",
    "Trump had a wonderful first 100-days in his first term in 2017, when he inherited from President Obama 75 consecutive weeks of a booming economy and the lowest unemployment rates in decades. An economy that even he did not have the experience to ruin. Experience which he has now gained sufficiently to bring an economy he inherited from President Biden, which was the strongest in the world in October 2024, to the cusp of recession in a mere 100 days.",
    "Trump has unilaterally already instructed the cartographers in the United States to rename the oceanic basin and marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, bounded on the northeast by the gulf coast of the United States, on the south by Mexico and the southeast by Cuba, which has been known in all maps of the world for the past four centuries as the Gulf of Mexico, as the Gulf of America.",
    "The Gulf of Mexico is now called the Gulf of America for Google Maps users in the United States, in keeping with the terms of President Trump\u2019s controversial Executive Order. In fact, President Trump recently banned an Associated Press reporter from White House briefings for continuing to name the Gulf of America by its original name, though that body of water remains the Gulf of Mexico in all other maps of the world.",
    "Trump is also proposing to rename Canada as the 51st State of the Union, Greenland as red white and blue land, the Gaza Strip as the United States Riviera and the Panama Canal as the Panamerica Canal. It is surprising that he has not renamed the Great States of New Mexico and Indiana as the Great States of Old America and Americana, respectively.",
    "Actually, Canadian liberals must thank Trump for his proposal to call Canada the 51st State. Pro-Trump Canadian conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, were leading the liberals by 25 points when Trump made the 51st State announcement after his inauguration in January, 2025. This angered all Canadians and united them, liberals and conservatives, so as to elect Mark Carney, the leader of the Liberal Party, as the Prime Minister of Canada last week. Thus arresting the swing towards the right that Canada was leaning after over a decade of liberal rule.",
    "It is likely that Trump will similarly unite all Americans against the Republicans, except, of course, the MAGA (Make America Great Again) cult, if his first 100-day performance is anything to go by.",
    "The performance of a president in his first 100 days was always measured by that of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was inaugurated in 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression, when America was reeling under unemployment and poverty. Since then, the first 100 days of every president\u2019s term has been taken as a benchmark to gauge the early success of a president.",
    "In Roosevelt\u2019s first inauguration speech in January 1933, he made his famous statement, \u201cWe have nothing to fear but fear itself\u201d. He spent his first week dealing with bank closures which were ruining the finances of families nationwide. He began a series of his renowned \u201cfireside chats\u201d, when he spoke to a radio audience of more than 60 million people, explaining to them what steps he was taking to alleviate the crisis.",
    "He restored the confidence of the people with the reopening of the banks with the enactment of the Emergency Banking Act. He created the beginnings of a social safety net with his New Deal, which aimed at the goals of increasing employment and to address the immediate needs for a support system for the poor. He spent millions of dollars on soup kitchens, employment schemes and nursery schools.",
    "Roosevelt\u2019s first 100 days saved America not only from the depression, but created the beginnings of an equitable \u201cwoke\u201d society, despised by today\u2019s American conservatives, in the richest nation in the world. A system which brings out all the creative features of capitalism with the compassion of democratic socialism, an ideology followed by every one of the advanced, wealthy nations of the world, bar the richest and the most advanced.",
    "It would be remiss if I did not list Trump\u2019s most important act on the first day of his inauguration, which had nothing to do with the economy. He pardoned every one of the 600 plus criminals who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, threatening to kill Vice-President Mike Pence and to violently impede the peaceful transfer of presidential power, as incited by him.",
    "Trump\u2019s first 100 days have taken the United States of America from an economy, which according to The Economist of October 2024, was \u201cThe Envy of the World\u201d, to one on the cusp of recession. The announcements of his increased tariffs have already increased prices and promises certain rises in inflation, as their effects begin to take effect in the immediate future.",
    "The biggest retailers in the country, like Walmart and Target, have already warned that increased tariffs will result in empty shelves within weeks, and small businesses, especially those trading in toys and other Christmas items, are already consulting with bankruptcy lawyers.",
    "Given the Republican\u2019s razor-thin majority in the House, Trump has so far ruled the nation by Executive Order. His record of 140 Executive Orders in his first 100-days eclipses Roosevelt\u2019s 99 in his first 100-days.",
    "Of course, FDR\u2019s Executive Orders were aimed primarily at saving the nation from the Great Depression. Trump\u2019s 140 were mainly aimed at \u201cthe greatest deportation program in the history of the world\u201d \u2013 which he has been carrying out by illegally deporting immigrants, some citizens and Green Card holders, without due process \u2013 but still at a lower rate than that achieved during the Biden administration.",
    "Trump has also, through the illegal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, terminated federal and other employees arbitrarily; often with no reference to merit and concentrating on eliminating DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) hires. A program designed to ensure that the interests of minorities are protected in hiring procedures. But a concept completely at odds with the Trump/Musk belief that only a white man is capable of doing any important job. A concept that Trump has conclusively proved in his hiring of the most important jobs in his cabinet, the most notable being the appointment of Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, a Fox Newscaster with a police record of lewd and drunken behavior.",
    "One of the first cuts by DOGE was the defunding of US AID (United States Agency for International Development), the premier US Agency for international aid to poverty-stricken communities worldwide, the greatest and most admired instrument of the USA for soft power. The closure of all US AID offices worldwide and immediate stoppage of shipping of food and medicines to poor nations have already cost thousands of lives.",
    "Trump has taken over as the Chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. It\u2019s a matter of time that its Board of Directors, including his Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles and the Second Lady of the USA, Usha Vance, clamor for its renaming to",
    "as the Trump Center. While JFK will be doing somersaults in his grave, the name is strangely appropriate. Who better at the Performing Arts than the Donald, whose performances in American courtrooms, election rallies and indeed during his time at the Oval Office, have captivated a nation.",
    "Trump has also threatened to stop the federal funding to Harvard University on false grounds of anti-Semiticism and DEI hires, and to force the university to submit to the government\u2019s control over its academic programs. Harvard\u2019s lawyers are fighting Trump, arguing, correctly that these orders violate the university\u2019s constitutional rights.",
    "Trump has already taken measures to close the Department of Education, and educational curricula will be left to the individual states. The history of the genocide of 10 million native Americans, slavery, Reconstruction, the Apartheid of Jim Crow, will be hidden from future generations of American kids.",
    "Fareed Zakhariya of CNN had an interesting take on Trump\u2019s assault on American universities. He stated that the federal funding of the greatest universities in the world, like Harvard, has enabled research resulting in major breakthroughs in science and medicine, which has made the USA produce the greatest number of Nobel Prize winners since World War II. That is what will be lost through Trump\u2019s idiocy. Fortunately, Trump will never win this particular battle.",
    "Of course, Trump blames the negative GDP numbers on the Biden administration. Although he did say, after he was elected, that the numbers will go up from the first day of his administration. Just as he said, during the first months of his first term, when he was claiming the credit for the booming economy he inherited from President Obama.",
    "Trump\u2019s polling numbers are all under water. He only has the support of his MAGA cult, and the Republican politicians who fear they will lose their jobs at the next midterms by being \u201cprimaried\u201d by Elon Musk. Of course, that depends on how long that unholy Trump/Musk alliance will last; it\u2019s already showing signs of a split.",
    "Trump\u2019s translation of the famous FDR words that \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u201d seems to be \u201cthe only thing we can rule by is fear itself\u201d.",
    "The consensus of all media outlets, including Fox News, is that Trump\u2019s first 100 days of his second term are the worst in 70 years. They are opening the eyes of Americans, as evinced by nationwide protests against tariffs, rising prices and illegal deportations. Americans seem to be regaining their courage, and courage is contagious.",
