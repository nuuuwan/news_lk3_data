This year, the society is celebrating its 75th anniversary.",

    "Speaking at the event, President Wickremesinghe mentioned that the society is celebrating its 75th anniversary and has been strengthening economic, cultural, and people-to-people bonds. The President stated, \u201cThere is a profound religious and cultural bond between Sri Lanka and India, and we share a common heritage. One notable aspect of this year\u2019s 75th anniversary is the \u2018Joint Vision\u2019 statement signed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and myself.\u201d He also emphasised, \u201cThroughout our discussions, we have consistently focused on the cultural and religious ties between our two countries, as well as the fact that we are both democracies with a shared British legal system. However, we have unfortunately overlooked the trade and economic relationship between Sri Lanka and India. It\u2019s important to remember that our relationship extends beyond cultural connections. Therefore, our immediate focus should be on enhancing these relationships. We aim to foster comprehensive ties between our two nations.\u201d",

Both countries share a broad understanding of major issues of international interest. It is commendable to see the President\u2019s vision and commitment to building a strong Sri Lanka and improving the Sri Lankan economy using all connectivity corridors to India. As a friendship society, we are very happy and equally proud of India\u2019s continued assistance to Sri Lanka when needed.\u201d",
    "Reddy also said, \u201cWe are like twins of the same mother, and the mother is the culture that brought us together. Like the phrase that everyone present here is familiar with, \u201cEka mawakage daru kala bawina, Yamu yamu wee nopama,\u201d let\u2019s go forward together like children of one mother,\u201d and ended with a toast, saying, \u201cWe wish Sri Lanka and India happiness, peace, and prosperity today and in the future, and to the enduring friendship and partnership between both countries.\u201d",
    "In his keynote address, High Commissioner Santosh Jha elaborated on the foundational principles, diverse elements, and evolving direction of India-Sri Lanka relations.
