    "The Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Rathnayake announced that postal voters who are still unable to cast their votes on the designated days will be permitted to vote at the District Secretariat corresponding to their workplace on November 07 and 08.",
    "The Election Commission has also issued guidelines on the proper voting and preference-marking procedure.",
    "Each voter has one vote, which can be cast for a recognized political party or an independent group. To do so, an \u2018x\u2019 mark should be placed in front of the chosen political party\u2019s symbol or in the space before the number and symbol of the independent group.",
