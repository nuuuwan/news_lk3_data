    "Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Arjuna Herath recently met with Sri Lanka Shippers\u2019 Council (SLSC) Chairman Sean Van Dort and representatives from the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Secretary General Yohan Lawrence and Brandix Group Head of Logistics Taiyoob Ahamed to discuss critical issues affecting the country\u2019s export industry.",
    "The talks focused on enhancing security measures and operational efficiency to safeguard Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation in the global market.",
    "Pilferage at crucial inspection points was highlighted as a key concern, with the SLSC reporting significant losses due to thefts at the Central Verification Terminal (CVT), allegedly involving Customs and BOI inspection officers, and industry-related wharf representatives. Incidents of theft of high-value merchandise occurring after cargo handovers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) Cargo Village have also been reported, resulting in international buyers submitting shortage claims.",
    "To tackle these issues, the SLSC proposed installing CCTV systems at key inspection points, specifically at BIA and CVT, to strengthen security and accountability. \u201cThe integrity of our supply chain is at risk, and the lack of proper surveillance is undermining the confidence of our international buyers,\u201d remarked an SLSC representative, emphasising the potential damage to Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation and the negative impact on export revenues.",
    "The SLSC also called for digitalisation of key processes within the BOI to be expedited which would streamline operations and minimise logistical delays. The shift to an online application system was highlighted as a solution to reduce inefficiencies in transportation, waiting times, and rework, thereby boosting overall industry productivity.",
    "\u201cThe digitalisation of these processes will benefit not just the garment sector but the entire export industry by creating a faster, more transparent, and reliable system,\u201d noted the SLSC Chairman. This transition would also position Sri Lanka as an economy that is agile and responsive to global standards.",
    "Herath acknowledged the concerns raised and reassured the SLSC representatives of his commitment to addressing these challenges. He expressed his support for exploring security upgrades at inspection points, adding that digitalisation efforts are already in progress within the BOI, with plans to accelerate these initiatives. He also emphasised the importance of continued collaboration and open communication between the BOI and industry stakeholders to promote mutual growth and transparency.",
    "A key concern raised was pilferage at inspection points, particularly at the Central Verification Terminal (CVT) and the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) Cargo Village. The SLSC reported significant thefts allegedly involving Customs and BOI inspection officers, as well as wharf representatives. These incidents have led to international buyers filing shortage claims, jeopardising confidence in Sri Lanka\u2019s supply chain.",
    "To mitigate these risks, the SLSC proposed the installation of CCTV systems at key inspection points, including BIA and CVT. \u201cThe integrity of our supply chain is at risk, and the absence of proper surveillance undermines international buyer confidence,\u201d a representative from the SLSC stated, warning of the potential impact on export revenues and the country\u2019s global standing.",
    "The SLSC also urged the BOI to accelerate the digitalisation of its processes. An online application system was recommended to streamline operations, reduce delays, and enhance transparency. \u201cDigitalisation will not only improve productivity but also position Sri Lanka as a more agile and globally competitive economy,\u201d noted the SLSC Chairman.",
    "Herath acknowledged these concerns and pledged his commitment to addressing them. He supported the proposed security upgrades and confirmed that digitalisation initiatives within the BOI are already underway, with plans to expedite progress. Emphasising the importance of collaboration, he called for ongoing dialogue between the BOI and industry stakeholders to foster growth and transparency."
