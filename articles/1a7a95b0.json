    "Dr. Dedunupitiya pointed out several issues affecting the dairy industry had resulted in this state. He said the price hike in forage, shortage of grass and grazing grounds, increasing prices of milch cows, want of a remunerative market for milk, increasing labour and transport costs. shortage of veterinary surgeons to provide instruction to farmers and poor supervision for want of officers had resulted in the declining trend of milk production, and the closure of dairy farms."
