    "DIMO Agribusinesses achieved a notable feat by doubling the LOVOL harvester market share in the previous season, establishing increased popularity within the Sri Lankan farming community. This success is attributed to the distinctive aftersales service provided for LOVOL harvesters.",
    "Elevating the mechanization of agriculture in Sri Lanka, DIMO Agribusinesses, the agriculture arm of DIMO, launched the LOVOL harvester, offering farmers the opportunity to actualize their harvesting aspirations. With LOVOL aftersales service farmers received personalized information on maintenance and regular advice to minimize maintenance costs while maximizing machine efficiency.",

By offering the appropriate machinery and unmatched aftersales care, we are transforming the way farming is done in Sri Lanka while fuelling the dreams and aspirations of the farming community through comprehensive agriculture mechanization.
