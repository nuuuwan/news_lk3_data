### Sri Lanka runs BOP surplus of US$2,185mn amid deflationary policy up to Aug

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has generated a 2,184 million dollar balance of payments surplus up to August 2024, running slightly ahead of last year, official data show.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate amid deflationary policy since scrapping a surrender rule in 2024.

A pegged central bank has to run deflationary monetary policy (selling securities held by the agency to the banking system to curtail domestic credit from rupees generated through from dollar purchases) to generate a balance of payments surplus.

When a BOP surplus (every day or every week) is generated by the central bank it is easy to allow the exchange rate to appreciate by purchasing less than the excess dollars created by deflationary policy.

Officials said no one on the ground was injured, and no nearby homes were damaged, though some vehicles were. The crash sparked a fire that burned about 100 to 200 yards (91 to 183 meters) of grass, officials said.

Firefighters at a nearby station heard the crash and responded, Whitmire said. He said it was a “terrible accident scene” and that the tower and helicopter were destroyed. Some area residents lost power, Whitmire said.

“It is surrounded by residences and that’s where we were very fortunate — that it didn’t topple in one direction or another,” Whitmire said. “And the fireball pretty much was isolated.”

### Sri Lanka Needs A Change In Exchange Rate Policy

*2024-10-22 06:53:38* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lanka-needs-a-change-in-exchange-rate-policy/) · `en`

The IMF promotes a floating exchange rate mechanism. CBSL governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe agrees with it, I think. Some economists too insist that CBSL cannot regulate the exchange rate, hence should allow the rupee to float. SJB has a different idea. They say that they allow first floating the currency to permit market forces to reveal the equilibrium rate , and then stabilizing that rate through CBSL intervention. I am not sure about the ideological stance of president Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the Minister of Finance.

The IMF never assumed that Sri Lanka should have a stable rate of exchange when they entered into an agreement to approve Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in March 2023. In this agreement the forecasted or estimated exchange rates were as follows:

### Clection, based on evidence to the Presidential Commission?

*2024-10-22 03:37:00* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c1484lz44rko) · `si`

Based on the information provided, it seems there may be some confusion or misinformation in the text regarding the Presidential Commission of Inquiry and its relationship with the judiciary and prosecution. Let me clarify some key points:



1. Presidential Commissions of Inquiry in Sri Lanka are investigative bodies appointed by the President to inquire into specific matters. They are not judicial bodies and cannot issue criminal charges or prosecute individuals.



2. The commissions can make recommendations based on their investigations, but these recommendations are advisory and not legally binding.



3. The Attorney General's Department has the authority to decide whether to prosecute based on evidence presented to the commission. However, this does not mean the commission itself can prosecute.



4. There is a separate legal process for prosecuting crimes, involving the police, courts, and the Attorney General's Department.



5. The commissions are meant to investigate and report findings to the President, who may then take action based on those findings.



Regarding the specific cases mentioned:



- The Paskarealingam case: The Supreme Court ruled against the commission's recommendation due to procedural issues, not because the commission could prosecute.



- The Wijayapala Mendis case: The Supreme Court found the commission did not have proper evidence and lacked legal authority.



- The Sirisena Cooray case: The Supreme Court ruled against the commission's findings due to procedural errors.



- The cases involving Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, etc.: The Court of Appeal upheld the right to challenge the commission's recommendations.



In summary, while presidential commissions can make recommendations, they do not have the power to prosecute individuals or issue legally binding judgments. Any prosecution would need to go through separate legal channels involving the police, courts, and the Attorney General's Department.

As soon as a controversial event has a controversial event, the appointment of the investigation commissions are common.

Some people allege that the Commission will appoint these tests to calm the masses under the problem.

There are other allegations that the information revealed in such commissions have been tempted to carry out the legal functions and their efforts and time and money.

Accordingly, the conclusions and recommendations issued by the Presidential Commission of Initance Commission established in the country have a number of occasions as well as the judiciary of the judiciary.This is about this.

### Irrational Behaviour Of RW & MR Vs Rational Behaviour Of AKD

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behavior can be compared with the rational behavior of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD). Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost.

Given the parliamentary election on 14 Movement 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

### Sri Lanka’s road to global competitiveness: Insights from trade, energy, and agriculture policies

In 2023, Sri Lanka’s goods and services exports made up nearly 20.4% of GDP, with manufacturing exports contributing 14%. However, the country’s merchandise export mix remains highly concentrated, with 77% of export income coming from industrial goods, mainly apparel, and just 22% from agricultural exports. This lack of sufficient diversification leaves Sri Lanka’s export economy vulnerable, heavily dependent on the apparel sector and traditional sectors like tea and rubber.

The University Grants Commission and the National Education Commission are appointed by the President for a fixed term. We should be able to trust the boards of these institutions to give a reasonable timetable for their resignation, even if legally they can serve until the end of their term

This is not the first time that a regime changed, and the board members got marching orders from minions in their organisation who have now got close to the ears of the executive. People who have served with dedication have to leave like thieves at night even before a new board is in place. There must be a better way – not just for civility but for the benefit of the country

The State apparatus consists of the executive, ministries, departments and public enterprises. A regime change is signified by the election of a new President and the formation of a new Cabinet of Ministers headed by the President. A Cabinet reshuffle also signifies a change in leadership of a ministry within the regime.

Sri Lanka experienced six consecutive quarters of negative economic growth up to the third quarter of 2023. This downturn has had a direct impact on the labour market, leading to lower wage rates and discouraging workforce participation and skill development. As a result, productivity levels continue to fall, creating a vicious cycle known as the “low productivity trap”, which hampers further economic recovery.

### Should Sri Lanka allow politicians to play the pork barrel game in the future?

Principally, every rupee spent by the Government should maximise the social welfare of the citizens

Pork-barrel politics can lead to a fragmented political system where representatives focus more on their individual districts rather than working collaboratively to address broader, more urgent national issues. It creates a system where narrow, localised interests dominate policy decisions

In the 19th century, barrels filled with salted pork were considered a significant source of food, especially in rural America. This was a food preservation technique to make the meat last through the winter. Another interesting fact is that not every family had the capability to own such a barrel full of salted pork. This means that owning a pork barrel also served as a symbol of a prestigious social class with greater access to resources.

Can employers sustain this hike in light of Sri Lanka’s current economic reality?

Fair wages are essential to the financial security of workers, but can employers sustain a wage hike in a fragile economy? This article explores key milestones in Sri Lanka’s minimum wage legislation from 2000 onwards, examines the population below the poverty line, and discusses whether businesses can absorb the recent increases amidst the country’s economic challenges, including debt obligations and import restrictions.

1. Early legislative efforts: Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers Act, No. 36 of 2005

In 2005, Sri Lanka introduced the Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers Act, No. 36 of 2005, which required private sector employers to provide a monthly relief allowance of Rs. 1,000.

Here's a 200-character summary of the movie review:



"Sir" film review: Bose Venkat's directorial debut explores caste issues in 1950s-80s Tamil Nadu. Saravanan shines as Ponnarasan, while Vimal impresses in romantic and action scenes. Sayadevi makes a strong debut. Music by Sidhu Kumar adds depth. Some emotional scenes lack intensity. Overall, a powerful portrayal of educational rights for oppressed communities.

🟩

Actors: Wimal, Saya Devi, Saravanan, Rama, S. Siraj, Saravana Shakti, writer Jayapalan and others.

Actor and Director Bose Venkat is the second film 'Sir'. Watching the film, the director has given the audience through his company, amazing that this should be said to the community.

After the contribution of Vijayamaran, the expectation of the film increased.Or not?We will continue to see.

Ponnarasan works as the headmaster in a school -sponsored school in the village of Mangollai.

His father Annadurai was also retired as the headmaster of the school.

He is currently being built by chains. Students studying in the school in the town are provoking his disability and having fun.

Thus, Sivagnanam, the son of Ponnarasan, who is provoking, fights for justice for the students who mocked his grandfather.

But because they are the dominant caste, his mother suppresses Sivagnanam that he should not go to fight.
