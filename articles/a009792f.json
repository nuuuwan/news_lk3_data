    "For the first time in five years forex earnings from Ceylon Tea crossed the billion dollar mark in the first nine months of production in 2024, indicating the brand was very much in a strong position worldwide.",
    "Asia Siyaka Weekly Tea Update reported, quoting Customs data, that production for September was 19.7 million kilos, 15 percent less than for the corresponding month last year, at 23.1 million kilos.",
    "Approximate earnings for the first nine months this year, however, amounting to 1,059 billion dollars were a 6 percent increase over the first nine months of 2023.",
    "Strong dollar earnings were indicative of increased demand for Ceylon Tea. Iraq continued to lead market demand for the brand during the relevant period. Russian demand grew 4 percent to 18. 4 million kilos followed by UAE. UAE volumes increased by 17.4 million kilos, an increase of 33 percent. Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, Chile and Libya were leading destinations for Ceylon Tea.",
    "The brand found destinations in parts of Germany and Hamburg was mentioned as a destination that witnessed growth.",
    "We did not have positive input on these developments from government sources, not least the Tea Board.",
    "Asia Siyaka further reported rupee earnings which ultimately trickled down to tea producers but remained flat at 323.3 billion SLR.",
    "Lower auction prices simultaneously with rising cost of production negated much of the gloss from higher dollar earnings.",
    "The smallholder sector, dependent on the tea factory owner segment, benefited from the increased dollar value. Their comments were that in some areas smallholders were paid Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 per kilo for green leaf supplied to tea factory owners. The general view was that because of the bullish dollar earnings small holder earnings were in large part positive.",
    "Forbes and Walker market report too commented that the current positive market developments impacted dollar earnings positively.",
    "However, commenting on district performances, the report said Nuwara Eliya teas were mostly unsold because suitable bids were not as sizeable as expected.",
    "The report further said much less activity was noted from shippers to the UK, the Continent and South Africa.",
    "Buying preferences were also established from shippers to Japan and China. Shippers from CIS countries continued to participate on a wider cross section of teas.",
