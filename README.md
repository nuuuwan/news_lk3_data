### Russia tests readiness of nuclear missile unit

*2024-10-18 16:45:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102783/russia-tests-readiness-of-nuclear-missile-unit) ┬╖ `en`

Russia is testing the combat readiness of a unit equipped with Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles in a region northwest of Moscow, news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying on Friday.

The Yars, which can be deployed in silos or mounted on mobile launchers, has a range of up to 11,000 km (6,835 miles) and is capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads.

Russia has carried out a series of nuclear drills this year in what security analysts say are signals intended to deter the West from intervening more deeply in the war in Ukraine.

The latest one is taking place in the same week that NATO conducted its annual nuclear exercise and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy unveiled his тАЬvictory planтАЬ.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that Moscow had extended the list of scenarios that could prompt it to use nuclear weapons, effectively lowering the threshold for their use. Ukraine accused Moscow of nuclear blackmail.

The Ministry of Defense has been petitioned in the Court of Appeal, seeking to overturn a directive that requires individuals holding firearms for personal protection under licensed permits to return them.

The Secretary of the Ministry of Defense, the Director of the State Intelligence Service, and the Acting Inspector General of Police have been named as respondents in the case.

Filed through lawyer Sanath Wijayawardena, the petition claims that Mr. de Silva obtained licensed firearms from the Ministry of Defense around 2012 or 2013 due to serious personal threats.

Sajith Premadasa criticizes government for failing to negotiate with IMF to reduce tax burden. Promises to renegotiate IMF agreement if elected, citing need for economic relief and tax reform.

ЁЯЯй

тАЬUnited People's Power President Sajith Premadasa has questioned why the government cannot negotiate with the IMF and reduce tax burden.

A meeting with the United People's Power Party activists was held yesterday (17) under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the United People's Power and United People's Alliance (UPFA).. He then asked.

тАЬWhile the people are looking for a new journey to negotiate with the IMF, increase the relief available to the people, and reduce the tax burden on the people, the government has been unable to reduce the direct and indirect taxes imposed on the people.

тАЬThe destined taxes are similar. The current government continues to comply with the International Monetary Fund. The government has forgotten the promises made during the election.

### CEB clarified about fueling thermal power plants

*2024-10-18 15:32:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202314) ┬╖ `si`

Here's a 200-character summary:



CEB clarifies fuel supply for thermal power plants. Uses HFO (5.8%), naphtha (1.9%), diesel (1.1%) for electricity generation. Diesel purchase via CPC at fixed price due to lack of competitive bids. CEB considers diesel uneconomical but uses temporarily to meet demand until other power plants restored.

ЁЯЯй

The Ceylon Electricity Board has issued a special announcement on supplying fuel to thermal power plants.

It states that some recent newsletters are expected to explain the word 'fuel'.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (Ceylon Electricity Board) is also used to generate three types of fuel to generate electricity.

* Receipt oil (HFO) - 715.3 GWh (5.8% of total electricity production) in 2024

* Napatha (Naphatha) - 235.5 GWH (1.9% of the total electric production) in 2024

* Diesel (Diesel) - 133.1 GWH (1.1% of total electric production) in 2024

Both credits (HFO) and Naupta (Naphatha) are bypace on the oil refinery.

Since there is no other supplier, the Ceylon Electricity Board is purchased by CPC from an anciently agreed price.

Competitive bidding is diesel, and some of them have recently commenced their business for diesel.

However, even under the management of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Diesel has not purchased competitive bids for electricity generation.

### Egg traders urge govt to implement pricing formula

The All Ceylon Egg TradersтАЩ Association has called on the government to introduce a pricing formula to stabilize the price of eggs in the market.

The Secretary of the association Anura Marasinghe stated that it costs less than Rs. 25 to produce an egg, making it feasible to sell them at a price of Rs. 35 per egg.

тАЬThe issue of escalating egg prices remains unresolved, with current market rates ranging from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 per egg. We urge the government to appoint a committee and establish a transparent pricing formula,тАЭ Mr. Marasinghe said.

He further noted that the actual production cost of an egg is between Rs. 20 and Rs. 23, while farm-gate prices currently stand at around Rs. 30.

The association believes a pricing mechanism would benefit both producers and consumers, ensuring fair pricing across the board.

### KenyaтАЩs deputy president sacked while in hospital

Kenyan senators have voted to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office despite his failure to testify at his impeachment trial after his lawyer said he had been taken to hospital.

In one of the most dramatic days in KenyaтАЩs recent political history, Gachagua had been due to appear in the Senate after lunch to defend himself, a day after he had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges.

However, Gachagua, popularly known as Riggy G, did not show up and his lawyer requested a postponement saying his client was suffering from chest pains and was being treated by doctors at The Karen Hospital.

Senators chose to continue the trial without him, prompting the defence team to leave the chamber.

The senatorsтАЩ refusal to delay proceedings until Saturday - as long as would have been legally allowed - shows how determined they were to get rid of Gachagua, several months after he fell out with President William Ruto.
