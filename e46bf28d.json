    "According to the Times of Israel, on Oct. 7, Toledano was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival in the southern Israeli desert \u2014 along with his friend, 21-year-old Mia Schem, and dozens of others \u2014 during Hamas\u2019 bloody and violent assault that left at least 1,200 people dead.",

Her mother, Karen Schem, told CBS News at the time that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to see my daughter, I see the pain, I see that she\u2019s in physical pain.\u201d",
