    "One of Sri Lanka respected business leaders and the only Sri Lankan to head the Rotary Global as Rotary International President based in Chicago , US- K R Ravindran was recognized by WIM /IFC ( member of World Bank) in Sri Lanka for his role played in promoting DEI in Rotary and his work place .",
    "Ravindran co-founded Printcare Plc with the late Merrill J Fernando nearly 40 years ago. Printcare is one of South Asia\u2019s highly respected, diversified printing and packaging companies with multiple manufacturing plants in Sri Lanka, India, and Africa. Printcare is also well known in the industry as a sought-after employer. It promotes DEI strongly, offers several worker-friendly schemes, employs physically and mentally challenged people, and works with and supports the schools and community around its plants",
    "Ravindran thanked the Women in Management team, for their unwavering dedication to advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at a time especially at a time when such values are being questioned and regrettably scaled back in some parts of the world.",
    "\u201cIn the U.S., for instance, leading companies like Walmart, John Deere, Ford, and Harley Davidson have recently reduced or halted their DEI initiatives, citing financial pressures and maybe current political trends. In contrast, companies in Sri Lanka remain steadfast in their commitment to creating a genuinely respectful workplace, fostering a space where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered and where differences are celebrated as strengths, said KR Ravindran who has also been featured on the cover of the worldwide-circulating printing magazine Heidelberg News.",
