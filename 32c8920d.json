    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 The Department of Motor Traffic has announced the implementation of a new system that facilitates persons with disabilities in obtaining driver's licenses.",
    "Motor Traffic Commissioner General Nishantha Anuruddha Weerasinghe said that an expert committee has been established for this specific purpose. The committee comprises an additional commissioner from the motor traffic department, a chief motor traffic inspector, and a doctor. The committee's initial task is to assess the physical fitness of persons with disabilities who apply for a driver's license in any vehicle category, taking into account their existing disabilities.",
    "Furthermore, practical assessments will determine if the current disability poses any obstacles that may affect driving for persons with disabilities. It was also noted that if the expert committee concludes that there are no such hindrances, persons with disabilities will have the opportunity to undergo the standard written and practical tests required for obtaining a driving license. In addition, the Motor Traffic Department has issued a new circular outlining the guidelines for this revised process.",
