    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka suffered a blackout as Saturday evening as the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board grid was hit by a cascading power failure.",
    "The cascading failure is believed to have been triggered by the failure of the Kothmale-Biyagama transmission line.",
    "\u201cThe Ceylon Electricity Board wishes to inform our customers that due to the failure of Kotmale \u2013 Biyagama main transmission line, an island wide power failure has occurred,\u201d CEB Spokesman Noel Priyantha said.",
    "\u201cStep by step restorations are underway and it may take few hours to completely restore the power supply.\u201d",
    "With hydro plants running flat out, a outage of the line tends to create a big imbalance in the demand and supply, leading to tripping of more lines and generators.",
    "Lines can trip due to lightening strikes, or equipment failures.",
    "Sri Lanka last suffered a cascading failure in December 2021, due to the failure of the same transmission line.",
