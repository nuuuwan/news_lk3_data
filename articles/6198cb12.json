  "original_body_lines": [
    "Administration has moved to stifle criticism with a draft of new, repressive laws",
    "Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis largely caused by\u00a0misgovernance\u00a0and\u00a0lack of accountability.\u00a0Public protests in 2022\u00a0forced the president and the prime minister, brothers Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa,\u00a0to step down.",
    "But instead of focusing on social justice and rights, the new government, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is focused on\u00a0suppressing dissent\u00a0and limiting international attention on human rights.",
    "Although it is the Rajapaksas that nominated \u2013 and are propping up \u2013 their successor, many foreign observers, including in India and the United States, had hoped that things would change.",
    "Wickremesinghe, who had previously politically opposed the Rajapaksa-led party, was expected to reverse the authoritarian policies of the previous government, address entrenched corruption, stabilise the economy and even comply with international pledges to bring long-awaited justice for violations during the 1987-\u201989 insurgency in the south, and the 1983-2009 civil war in the north.",
    "Instead, Wickremesinghe has moved forcefully to stifle criticism with a raft of new, repressive laws as the country prepares to hold a presidential election later this year. The Online Safety Act, adopted by parliament in January,\u00a0creates vague and broad speech-related offenses\u00a0punishable with lengthy prison terms.",
    "The Anti-Terrorism Bill currently before parliament\u00a0contains draconian powers, while the government\u00a0continues to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act\u00a0to violate fundamental due process rights. A draft law to regulate non-governmental organisations, circulated by the government in January, could make it impossible for\u00a0civil society\u00a0organizations to function freely.",
    "Back in 2015, when Wickremasinghe was the prime minister, he backed a\u00a0consensus resolution\u00a0at the United Nations Human Rights Council, committing to 25 key undertakings across a range of human rights issues, mostly related to the 1983-2009 civil war.",
    "That government also pledged to provide answers to families of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d, and to provide reparations for victims of abuses.",
    "But there was little progress, and his government lost the next elections. Soon after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president in 2019,\u00a0he withdrew from the resolution, appointing officials implicated in\u00a0war crimes\u00a0and serious rights abuses to\u00a0politically powerful\u00a0and\u00a0senior official positions. Numerous\u00a0mass graves, in most cases discovered accidentally, have not been properly examined to identify the victims or their killers.",
    "The UN Human Rights Council in a 2021\u00a0resolution\u00a0established the\u00a0Sri Lanka Accountability Project\u00a0to gather evidence of international crimes for use in future prosecutions. With the resolution due for renewal in September 2024, Wickremesinghe, this time, is\u00a0hoping\u00a0to persuade the council to\u00a0end its scrutiny\u00a0of Sri Lanka.",
    "But the government\u2019s actions expose the need for continued international attention. Even as it has announced the\u00a0Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill, purportedly to address civil war atrocities, the authorities continue to silence and repress the families of the disappeared.",
    "Successive Sri Lankan governments have appointed at least 10 commissions since the 1990s to examine human rights violations and war crimes. The new law simply\u00a0replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka\u2019s international legal obligations.",
    "Many\u00a0victims say\u00a0they have \u201ccommission fatigue\u201d, and see no use in providing their testimony again, risking re-traumatisation and possible threats from security forces.",
    "The government needs to urgently reverse course to meet its human rights obligations. That should include repealing or reforming the Online Safety Act to protect the rights to free expression and privacy; amending the Anti-Terrorism Bill to meet international human rights standards; imposing a moratorium on the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act until it is repealed; and dropping the draft non-governmental organisations law, or any bill that constrains civil society.",
    "The Wickremesinghe administration should work to correct the authoritarian legacy of its predecessors by safeguarding freedom of expression and letting\u00a0civil society groups operate freely,\u00a0particularly in the north and east.",
    "It should stop arresting Tamil community members for the\u00a0memorialisation of their war dead, and end government actions\u00a0to appropriate Tamil and Muslim lands, including religious sites, in the north and east.",
    "Sri Lankans are grappling with declining economic and social conditions, amid impunity for decades of human rights violations and for official corruption.",
    "According to the United Nations World Food Programme, in 2023 more than 17% of the population was moderately or acutely food insecure and in need of humanitarian assistance, and 31% of children under 5 were malnourished. From 2021 to 2022, the country\u2019s\u00a0poverty rate doubled, to 25% and is projected to rise further.",
    "In March 2023, a\u00a0loan\u00a0from the International Monetary Fund paved the way for multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to offer\u00a0new financing.",
    "The International Monetary Fund programme focused on raising government revenues and emphasised tackling corruption and improving social protection. However, as structured, the program has shifted the burden of recovery principally onto people with low incomes,\u00a0undermining people\u2019s economic and social rights.",
    "Wickremesinghe is afraid of Sri Lankans holding their government accountable. International partners, whom he relies upon to support his economic program, need to vigorously support democratic norms and the rule of law too.",
    "RW tells MPs that \u201cthere are no short cuts to abolish executive presidency\u201d",
    "Nishantha\u2019s SUV was being driven at breakneck speed, driver admits",
