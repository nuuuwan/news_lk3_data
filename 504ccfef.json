    "Hameedia, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading menswear brand synonymous with style and quality, is celebrating Father\u2019s Day by offering 1,000 special gift packs to fathers from all walks of life.",
    "Hameedia invites the general public to nominate fathers, with a brief description in any language as to why he is special, by sending all submissions via direct messages on Hameedia Facebook or Instagram or by emailing marketing@hameedia.com. After a grand draw, 1,000 deserving fathers will be rewarded with an exciting Hameedia gift pack that is sure to bring joy into their lives.",
    "There is no doubt parents undergo great hardships to raise their children. They ensure that every aspect of their child is taken care of including health, education, food, clothing and more. As these children grow up, they pursue higher studies, obtain jobs, get married, build homes, buy vehicles and start their own families. During the process of achieving such life goals, often the parents are sidelined and sometimes even neglected to the point where they live the rest of their years struggling to come to terms with how poorly their children are treating them and often end up depressed and unhappy. Understandably, parents from underprivileged communities undergo even more hardships during their life journey. Through this timely initiative, Hameedia aims to create awareness of the immense contributions made by fathers in bringing up children and how there must be a consistent effort by the children to take better care of these individuals and appreciate them daily or as often as possible.",
    "Hameedia\u2019s Managing Director Fouzul Hameed stated, \u201cParents go through great pain and suffering to bring you up in life. Once a year celebrations such as \u2018Mother\u2019s Day\u2019 and \u2018Father\u2019s Day\u2019 are fine but what we must all remember is to celebrate them every day in our own little way. Even a small gesture of love, kindness and caring is enough to brighten up their lives and we must make it a habit to pay special attention and appreciate them regularly. Every religion teaches about the importance respecting elders and taking good care of parents especially when they\u2019re old and feeble. Parents also have the responsibility of bringing up children in a way where they learn to respect elders and won\u2019t abandon or neglect parents. Even if our modern, busy lifestyles leave us with little time, we must find a way to look after them well and give them all the resources to live happy, comfortable lives. That is why I firmly believe that \u2018Every day should be Father\u2019s Day\u2019 and not merely celebrate them once a year.\u201d",
