    "The discussion, which centred on the outlook for the US-Sri Lanka relations under the presidencies of Trump and Dissanayake, focused on anticipated foreign policy perspectives and priorities of both new administrations in this decisive period, considering the historical moment with the decisive mandates given for both leaders by their constituencies.",
    "The discussion highlighted how the second Trump administration would approach the Indo-Pacific and the significance of regional groupings, such as QUAD and AUKUS. Washington\u2019s stance on working with regional and global partners on economic issues and mutually beneficial areas in the Indian Ocean, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), its policy on Afghanistan, and the objective of contributing to stability in the Indo-Pacific, was further noted.",
