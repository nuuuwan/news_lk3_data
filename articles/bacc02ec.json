    "Mr. Muthu was born to Karunanidhi\u2019s first wife Padmavathi; he was an actor and singer, who was known to have styled himself after MGR",
    "Mu. Ka. Muthu, the eldest son of the late Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and half-brother of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, died in Chennai on Saturday (July 19, 2025). He had been ailing for a long time. He was 77 and is survived by his wife, son, and daughter.",
    "Mr. Muthu was born to Karunanidhi\u2019s first wife Padmavathi, daughter of Chidambaram Padagasundaram Pillai, a renowned musician and composer. His maternal uncle, C.S. Jayaraman \u2014 a playback singer \u2014 rendered many songs for Sivaji Ganesan-starrers, including his debut film Parasakthi.",
    "The way Mr. Muthu styled himself after MGR, even affecting a physical resemblance, was a source of some discomfort for his family. Mr. Muthu was promoted as an actor by Karunanidhi\u2019s family to produce a home-grown hero, as there was always tension between the DMK and film stars associated with the party. Actors like Sivaji Ganesan, M.G. Ramachandran (MGR), and poet Kannadasan were all once close to Karunanidhi.",

    "\u201cMr. Muthu could have emerged as a successful film personality had he relied on his talents as a singer and actor. But his language, song sequences, and even hairstyle resembled those of MGR. This was one of the factors that contributed to the misunderstandings between MGR and Karunanidhi,\u201d Subagunarajan, editor, Katchipizhai, once told The Hindu, noting that MGR continued to patronise Mr. Muthu even after leaving the DMK.",
