### Is the election speech?Real relief?- Speaking to Ranil Wickremesinghe's people

*2024-06-28 16:27:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187194) · `ta`

Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe's announcement of a debt agreement with bilateral creditors is seen by many as a pre-election strategy to boost support amid the country's ongoing economic challenges. The deal, aimed at restoring economic stability, is set to be discussed in Parliament on July 2nd. Critics, however, view it as a political maneuver rather than a genuine solution, especially considering the upcoming October elections. Political analyst Professor Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri suggests Wickremesinghe's speech is an attempt to counter his political opponent Sajith Premadasa, highlighting the divided support within the United National Party. Despite the potential for Wickremesinghe to leverage his economic recovery vision against Premadasa, the effectiveness of such strategies remains uncertain amidst widespread public discontent and skepticism towards austerity measures imposed by the IMF.

Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced the highly anticipated debt agreement with bilateral creditors.

These debt processing measures are based on the International Monetary Fund's plan to restore Sri Lanka's micro -economic stability.

These agreements will be submitted and accepted at a special session of Parliament on the second of July.

However, many analysts have described the announcement of Wickremesinghe's announcement of the debt restructuring- they have commented that the presidential elections are due to take place in Octobar this year.

A halting Joe Biden struggled Thursday to allay concerns he is too old for a second term in the White House in a fiery debate with Donald Trump marked by personal insults.

A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage.

Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was faltering as he spoke rapidly in a raspy, trailing-off voice, stumbled on his words and stared open-mouthed.

His performance, after he spent the week secluded in preparation, sparked new concern within his Democratic Party as polls show Trump is tied or ahead for the November election.

It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being history’s worst.

Trump and Biden, who were each the oldest president when first elected, even accused each other of being childlike as they argued over their golf swings.
