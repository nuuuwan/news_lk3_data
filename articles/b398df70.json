    "\u201cIt is confirmed there are 21 crew members on board. The crew members are busy with their normal duties on the ship as well as assisting the National Transportation Safety Board and Coast Guard investigators on board,\" a spokesperson of Grace Ocean Pte and Synergy Marine told PTI.",
    "The crew is on board the container vessel Dali that collided with the 2.6-km-long four-lane Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Patapsco River in Baltimore in the early hours of March 26. The 984-foot cargo ship was bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka.",
    "On how long the crew would have to stay on board the ship, the spokesperson said, \u201cAt this time, we do not know how long the investigation process will take and until that process is complete, the crew will remain on board.\u201d The Singapore-flagged Dali is owned by Grace Ocean Pte Ltd and managed by the Synergy Marine Group. Earlier, the non-profit organisation Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center had said that the Indian crew on board the container vessel was \u201chealthy\u201d.",
