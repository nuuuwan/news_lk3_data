    "The Women Parliamentarians\u2019 Caucus has sent a letter to the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe requesting that the Bill gazetted on 09 February 2024 to amend Chapter 19 of the Penal Code be withdrawn immediately.",
    "According to the amendments made to the Penal Code in 1995, even if a victim under 16 years of age has sexual relations of their own free will, it is considered rape. However, the proposed new amendment to the Penal Code by the Justice Minister will lower the age of sexual consent to 14 years.",
    "Taking this into account, Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, the Chair of Women Parliamentarians\u2019 Caucus expressed her deep concern about the proposed amendment to section 364 of the Penal Code, while detailing matters to be concerned about the proposed amendments to section 364 in her letter.",
    "Thus, Dr. Fernandopulle, on behalf of the Women Parliamentarians\u2019 Caucus, requested the government to withdraw the proposed bill to amend Section 364 of the Penal Code, while prioritizing the protection of women and children and upholding the justice for vulnerable population in Sri Lanka.\u00a0 She further informed in her letter that the Caucus is ready to discuss further information or alternative proposals in this regard at any time."
