Ravindranath Dabare, legal adviser to the Center for Environmental Justice (CEJ), said that it is not acceptable as a government to take the control of the crops in the hands of the people without taking appropriate action.

He was responding to a comment made by Minister of Agriculture KD Lalkantha in Parliament on December 5.. The Minister stressed that there are no legal obstacles in determining how farmers deal with animals that damage their crops.

“A responsible minister reveals such a statement, which will make people permission to kill any animals that can damage their crops,” he said.

For example, the elephants have been given special protection to the elephants under the 12th string of the Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the killing of elephants is strictly forbidden for crop damage. Peacocks are also listed as a protected species under the law. Therefore, there is no legal section that allows the killing of peacocks.
