    "The NPP government and the Opposition have locked horns over the detection of a huge stock of chemicals, believed to have been smuggled in two freight containers, for manufacturing crystal methamphetamine (popularly known as ICE) in a factory belonging to notorious underworld figure, Kehelbaddara Padme (KB) currently in detention. NPP politicians and their propagandists are in overdrive to implicate the entire SLPP in the drug trade on the grounds that the consignment of precursor chemicals had been concealed in a property belonging to a former SLPP local councillor described as an accomplice of KB.",
    "Ironically, a few weeks after legalising the cultivation of cannabis for export despite protests, the NPP government has sought to discredit its political rivals by flogging an issue related to local narcotic production. The SLPP has sacked the suspect wanted in connection with the consignment or precursor chemicals. It and other Opposition parties have claimed that the chemicals smuggled in for ICE production were found in two of the 323 containers released via the green channel at the Colombo Port at the behest of the NPP government, in January 2025.",
    "Police Spokesperson ASP F.U. Wootler has said, in answer to a question from the media, the containers where chemicals at issue were found were not among the ones whose release is mired in controversy. He has said a CID probe has revealed that the containers at issue are different. How can he be so sure? For a criminal outfit capable of bringing in precursors for narcotic production, changing the numbers, etc., on the freight containers they smuggle in, is child\u2019s play.",
    "Only a thorough, impartial investigation will reveal when the containers in question were actually brought in and whether they were released without Customs inspection due to a government intervention. But the Public Security Ministry and the CID are headed by two NPP activists, and the police are under the government\u2019s thumb. It is therefore na\u00efve to expect the police to act independently and impartially. The person who went out of his way to defend the government over the container controversy, as the Customs Spokesman, has been appointed the Customs Chief!",
    "It is popularly said that he that hath an ill name is half hanged. The SLPP politicians earned notoriety for having close ties with anti-social elements, especially when they were in the SLFP-led UPFA. They therefore have their work cut out to live down their sullied past. One may recall that in 2013, more than 131 kilos of heroin were found in a shipping container, which a coordinating secretary to the then Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne requested the Customs to clear on a priority basis. Besides, we have written extensively about a nexus that existed between a drug dealer, known as Kudu Lal, who ran the heroin distribution network in Colombo, and the UPFA, and how a minister in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government helped him flee the country in the 2000s. The minister escorted the drug kingpin up to the boarding area at the BIA to ensure the latter\u2019s safety. Today, the Opposition has alleged that some councillors with links to Kudu Lal helped shift the balance of power in favour of the NPP in the Colombo Municipal Council, and the government had the mayoral election there conducted by secret ballot to prevent that fact from becoming public.",
    "Meanwhile, donations from undisclosed sources continue to swell the war chests of political parties, especially ahead of elections. The existing laws to regulate campaign expenditure, etc., were made out to be a silver bullet to eliminate corrupt practices related to electoral contests and prevent the use of black money to bankroll election campaigns. But they have proved ineffective, and colossal amounts of money flow into the financial reserves of political parties, mostly from the slush funds of shady characters.",
    "The Opposition is of the view that as the government has accused the SLPP of smuggling chemicals used in manufacturing ICE simply because a former SLPP local councillor has been found to be involved in the drug racket, by the same token, the JVP-led NPP should be held accountable for the Easter Sunday terror attacks because Mohamad Ibrahim, father of two suicide bombers, who financed the National Thowheed Jamaath terror network, was a National List candidate of the JVP in the 2015 general election. This argument is not without some merit. One may recall that in a leaked audio clip of what is described as a telephone conversation between Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and SSP Shani Abeysekera, who was the Director of the CID during the Yahapalana government, about the Easter Sunday terror attacks, the latter is heard telling the former something in Sinhala to the effect that Ibrahim, cannot be so stupid as not to have known what his two sons, who carried out the suicide bomb attacks on 21 April 2019, had been up to. Abeysekera has been pulled out of retirement and appointed CID Director.",
    "Nothing could be more sickening than the sight of two political parties with marred reputations hurling allegations at each other and claiming the moral high ground.",
