    "The Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court today (21) issued an arrest warrant against former Minister Douglas Devananda after he failed to appear before the court to testify in an ongoing case.",
    "The case pertaining to a complaint lodged by Devananda with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in 2016, accusing Wellawatta-based businessman Subramaniam Manoharan of issuing two fraudulent cheques, each valued at Rs. 10 million, was taken up before the court today.",
    "Despite being summoned to testify in court today, former Minister Devananda was absent. While his attorney claimed he was unwell, no medical documentation was submitted to substantiate the claim, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "Given the lack of credible justification for his absence, the Magistrate ordered the issuance of warrants to arrest and produce Devananda in court."
