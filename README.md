### AstraZeneca admits for first time its Covid vaccine CAN cause rare side effect

April 30 (Daily Mail) - AstraZeneca has admitted in court for the first time that its Covid jab can cause a deadly blood clotting side effect.

The exceedingly rare reaction is at the heart of a multi million-pound class action by dozens of families who allege they, or their loved ones, were maimed or killed by the pharmaceutical titan's 'defective' vaccine.

Lawyers representing the claimants believe some of the cases could be worth up to £20m in compensation.

Cambridge-based AstraZeneca, which is contesting the claims, acknowledged in a legal document submitted to the High Court in February that its vaccine 'can, in very rare cases, cause TTS'.

TTS is short for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome – a medical condition where a person suffers blood clots along with a low platelet count. Platelets typically help the blood to clot.

The complication – listed as a potential side effect of the jab – has previously been called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).

The criminal charges he been indicted on are for obstructing a free transfer of power of a US presidency, hiding white house classified documents in his Florida mansion and campaign funding violation in Ney York state. All these charges, if convicted potentially can send Trump to jail, again a first in the history of the USA.

The payments of other taxes such as Value Added Tax, Social Security Contribution Levy, Stamp Duty and others can continue to be paid by cheque.

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - The political parties should publicize their election manifestos well in advance of any election, be it a Presidential or Parliamentary poll, to create a better and responsible political culture in the country, the Peoples' Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said.

Executive Director PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi made these remarks while addressing a programme held in Colombo to raise awareness on creating a responsible political culture by encouraging political parties to present responsible and timely policy statements.

### 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy: National Peace Council says intl. role in ascertaining truth remains relevant

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said yesterday that the international role in ascertaining the truth of the 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy remains relevant even today.

On April 21, the country marked the fifth anniversary of the tragic Easter Sunday bombing that claimed the lives of approximately 300 persons and left more than 500 others injured and maimed. The enduring consequences of the Easter Sunday bombing need to be kept in mind. The economic repercussions, stemming from the decline in foreign investments and tourism, continue to haunt the country, contributing to the economic challenges faced today. The National Peace Council is particularly concerned that the erosion of trust in Government leadership, exacerbated by perceived failures in accountability and transparency, remains a pressing concern for all citizens. Unfortunately, this leads to frustration and loss of faith in the system, which can also lead to further injustices.

### A call to end  ‘Corporal Punishment’  and create a fear-free childhood

*2024-04-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-call-to-end-Corporal-Punishment-and-create-a-fear-free-childhood/172-281587) · `en`

School and home are the places where children spend most of the time of the day; hence corporal punishment should be absent in both places and they should feel safe in such environments

Research unequivocally shows that corporal punishment is linked to adverse outcomes, including increased aggression, poorer mental health, and diminished cognitive development, which could result in long-term psychological issues and social dysfunctions, ultimately contributing to a cycle of violence that affects the broader society and future generations

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74 per cent of parents resort to corporal punishment

The alternatives are rooted in communication, understanding, and mutual respect
