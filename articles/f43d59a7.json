    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Half of those now supporting opposition leader Sajith Premadasa will become part of a future alliance to be led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe no sooner the presidential election is announced, a United National Party (UNP) senior said.",
    "Former minister P Harrison speaking at a UNP event in Anuradhapura on Sunday June 09 claimed that several parties in both the government and the opposition have pledged their support for Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cA group from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are saying they\u2019re ready to support President Wickremesinghe. Duminda Dissanayake and company from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are saying publicly that a majority of their party are ready to assist him. People in the north and east, Mr C Vigneswaran says public that their full support is for the president, as does Mr Jeevan Thondaman and co from the estate sector,\u201d said Harrison.",
    "\u201cI will say one thing. The moment the election commissioner announces the this election, half of Mr Sajith Premadasa\u2019s people will come to sign the alliance that President Wickremesinghe forms,\u201d he added.",
    "The president had created the environment for opposition parties to engage in politics, Harrison said, dismissing concerns that the presidential election would be postponed.",
    "\u201cThere are no alternatives. President Wickremesinghe is the only leader that can develop the country.",
    "\u201cThere was a lot of talk about postponing the presidential election. The election will definitely be held before October 17, I\u2019m very confident of that,\u201d he added.",
    "It was, in fact, UNP general secretary Palitha Range Bandara who caused a stir recently by proposing that a referendum be held on the possibility of postponing the presidential election. Members of the government as well as UNP spokesmen have had to walk back this proposal, amid backlash, insisting that the poll will indeed go ahead as planned.",
    "Support for leftist candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake dropped six percentage points to 39 percent in April, levelling with opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, while support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe increased three points to 13 percent in a presidential election voting intent poll.",
    "The Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) conducted by the Institute for Health Policy showed that, according to its Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) provisional estimates of presidential election voting intent, National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Dissanayake and main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) lader Premadasa were now neck and neck while United National Party (UNP) leader Wickremesinghe had made some gains. A generic candidate for the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had the support of 9 percent of the people surveyed, up 1 percentage point from March. (Colombo/Jun10/2024)"
