“We believe the unbundling will improve CEB’s efficiency and competitiveness. The utility is already preparing separate financials, maintains separate bank accounts and is in the process of allocating assets and liabilities for the three units.

“However, we believe the restructuring faces execution risk and may be contingent on the outcome of Sri Lanka’s general election on 14 November.”

A deviation from cost reflective tariffs is risk to the CEB’s balance sheet.

“CEB has operated on a cost-reflective tariff mechanism since June 2023, which is revised quarterly to ensure operating costs are covered,” Fitch said.
