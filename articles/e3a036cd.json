In addition to technical and operational insights, participants also developed vital soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership\u2014key competencies that support long-term professional growth and integration into dynamic work environments.",

It helps bridge the gap between academic learning and practical experience, giving participants clarity on the skills and opportunities they may want to pursue to shape and build their careers. We\u2019re proud to partner in an initiative that takes inclusion from policy to action,\u201d said MAS Holdings Director \u2013 Group Sustainable Business Nemanthie Kooragamage.",
