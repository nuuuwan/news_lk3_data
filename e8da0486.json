    "\"I can interfere with the issues and grant solutions after discussion with the Cabinet ministers,\" he said.",
    "\"There might be some kind of political background operating behind this sudden strike. We need to find that out first. People always request that the railway department be privatized.

If the Railways Department is trying to inconvenience the public, then I will take a stern decision after discussing with the Cabinet,\" Minister Gunawardana said.",
