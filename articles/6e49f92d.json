    "Parliamentary proceedings in this country are characterised by references to political rejects or riff-raff or dregs. On Tuesday, the attention of the legislature was drawn to a different kind of waste\u2014refuse tea, which has led to serious problems that successive governments have failed to solve, and evolved into a kind of shadow industry, thriving outside regulatory oversight, feeding illegal supply chains and ruining Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation as a quality tea producer.",
    "An MP asked Minister of Plantation and Community Infrastructure Samantha Vidyarathna what action the government was planning to take to tackle the well-entrenched, lucrative refuse tea racket; he also wanted to know, among other things, whether any action would be taken to regulate the illegal tea waste trade so that the state would gain financially, as there was a market, both here and overseas, for discarded sweepings from factory floors, or whether the racket which adversely affected tea smallholders would be brought to an end.",
    "Admitting that refuse tea continued to enter the market, Minister Vidyarathna said there were laws to deal with that racket, and action had been taken to tackle it. He claimed the government was working towards optimising the production of quality tea and reducing the refuse tea generation to a bare minimum. His response was not much different from those of his predecessors who also made similar pledges in Parliament but did precious little to fulfil them.",
    "Refuse tea, which enters the market, masquerading as pure Ceylon tea, tarnishes Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation internationally and poses health risks to consumers here and overseas. The most effective way to tackle all these problems is to eliminate their root cause\u2014refuse tea, which must be destroyed at the source, under official supervision, like other edibles and drinkables unfit for human consumption.",
    "So, it defies comprehension why there should be any discussion, in Parliament or elsewhere, on exploring ways and means of regulating the illegal refuse tea trade or adopting band-aid remedies. An illegal practice must not be given any legitimacy through regulation; instead, it must be brought to an end. Refuse tea, by definition, is waste and it must be treated as such. It must not be allowed to leave the factories where it is generated. Let that be the bottom line.",
    "The illegal refuse tea trade is reportedly dominated by some underworld gangs that use threats and bribes to further their interests. Underworld leader Makandure Madush, described as Sri Lanka\u2019s Napoleon of Crime, operated from Dubai and facilitated tea waste smuggling operations. He even issued death threats to high-ranking state officials who tried to stop it. He is long dead, but in the netherworld of crime, narcotics, etc., when a gang leader dies, other criminals move in to fill the vacuum. The connivance of some state officials and politicians has made the task of eliminating the refuse tea trade even more difficult. Not even the Special Task Force has been able to neutralise the organised gangs involved in the racket. Not that the elite tactical force lacks the capability to accomplish that task. It has not been given a free hand; the racketeers have political connections and the wherewithal to prevent the law enforcement officers from going all out to put an end to their illegal operations. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake recently vowed to eliminate what he described as \u2018mini governments\u2019 in the country; one of them is apparently controlling the refuse tea trade.",
    "Meanwhile, there is a pressing need to conduct regular tests on tea consumed by ordinary Sri Lankans to ensure that it is fit for human consumption. Much of it looks more like black dust than tea, and its impact on health is anybody\u2019s guess. It is high time random samples of unhygienic tea freely available across the country were obtained and tested scientifically.",
