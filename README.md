### Harry J turns 82: more than a hard-nosed businessman

*2024-08-18 02:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/harry-j-turns-82-more-than-a-hard-nosed-businessman/) · `en`

Almost 20 years ago, I received a call from Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena. Of course, at the time I knew him as ‘Harry Jayawardena’ as did many Sri Lankans, especially in business circles. I was in England, veritably forced into exile by political circumstances which included the abduction and torture of the deputy editor of ‘The Nation,’ a newspaper published by Rivira Media Corporation, of which I was at the time the Managing Director, and a brutal attack on Upali Tennakoon, the editor of our sister newspaper in Sinhala.

These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickramatunge implored me to leave the country and not too long before he himself was killed. It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didn’t give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didn’t count Harry among them.

### FROM WHITES TO MUD

*2024-08-18 02:06:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/from-whites-to-mud/) · `en`

“Roti” Sivaratnam was Captain of the Royal College Rugby Team in 1957. He was also Captain of Boake House, which I belonged to.

One afternoon after school, I was on the tennis court practicing. At that time, we all wore white for both cricket and tennis practices.

From nowhere, “Roti” appeared on his bike and seemed extremely agitated. He caught a glimpse of me and immediately, in a most aggressive manner, summoned me to talk to him. He had a reputation for that and was a bit of a domineering guy.

I had no choice other than to excuse myself from the game in progress and go up to him.

As I got to his bike, he said firmly, jump on to the ‘doubling’ bar, which I did with no reasons given and no questions asked by me, for fear that most of us had for “Roti”.

I was told during our short journey, illegally doubling within school premises, that Boake was playing an inter House rugby game and were badly short of players. He wanted me to make up the team and play for Boake.

### Issues of co-ordination during the 1971 insurgency

*2024-08-18 01:32:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/issues-of-co-ordination-during-the-1971-insurgency/) · `en`

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

A major responsibility I took upon myself during this period (of the 1971 insurrecton) was to co-ordinate essential services such as food distribution; the movement of petroleum products; electricity, water; and transport. I, of course, had enough experience of handling food distribution. Some of the same principles and part of the same drill could be applied to some of the other sectors.

In a way food was the most important. Long curfew hours not only restricted food movements, but also gave very little time for the mass of the population to buy their essentials such as rice, flour and sugar from their co-operative, or authorized dealer point. During the few hours available for shopping, there were large and somewhat restive crowds at cooperative stores in particular. It was clear that if food was not available at these points or the service was not efficient, there would be panic.

### Vickramabahu – Towards A Durable Political Assessment

*2024-08-18 01:04:33* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/vickramabahu-towards-a-durable-political-assessment/) · `en`

Gauging Bahu’s political legacy is in progress with many commentators making piecemeal contributions. Eulogies and commentaries have appeared in recent months but the discourse that I commence here is different. My association with VBK (Vickramabahu Karunaratne) goes back decades when we both took coveted University of Ceylon Firsts in electrical engineering – myself, in the class of 1963 and Bahu in 1965. But more important are the deep political links that began to gel in the mid-1960s. I became a Samasamajist at the age of 12 under the influence of the August 1953 Hartal. Bahu was won over to the Left in the mid-1960s by his Akbar Hall undergraduate room-mate, Chris Ratnayake. Chris even bought Bahu a hairbrush to keep his grubby scalp away from his own brush. Salad days! What larks!
