    "Lee Kuan Yew enforced discipline on Singaporeans and it is one of the reasons for the prosperity of that tiny island nation. Japanese are disciplined by nature and the miraculous evacuation of 379 passengers and crew from a burning aircraft in Haneda airport, without any fatalities or major injuries, illustrate this. I greatly doubt whether we can hope for a bright future without being a disciplined society.",
    "Judging by what is happening at present, it is fair to state that Sri Lanka is suffering from not only an economic disaster but also from moral bankruptcy, unfortunately. Perhaps, the unpalatable solutions imposed with no care or concern for the most disadvantaged in the society may bring the country out of the economic mess, but will they bring us out of the moral bankruptcy? Very unlikely; in fact, it may produce just the opposite by forcing the poor to resort to unsavoury practices. Economy shows signs of improvement with draconian solutions imposed on by external forces, making the poor poorer but the rich continue to be living the life of Riley, as well illustrated by the photographic evidence of lavish celebrations during Christmas and New Year. As oft repeated by the editor of The Island, in many an editorial, the ground is getting riper for a bloody revolution and one can only pray that it does not happen!",
    "Watching events from a distance, with a heavy heart, I have often wondered what ails my Motherland which had such a bright future ahead, at the time of release of the shackles of colonialism. Looking back, the most striking feature is that every government we had since independence is more corrupt than the previous. Whilst corruption, which has spread from the political class to all strata of society, has contributed the majority share for our woes, two other factors seem to have contributed to our predicament; indiscipline and gullibility.",
    "There is hardly a doubt that it was the corrupt practices of both, Yahapalanaya and Pohottuwa that bankrupted the country. One would have thought that the present administration, which is a combination of parts of both, would have learned a lesson and strive to reduce corruption, even if politicians consider eradicating corruption inimical to their cause. Instead, their actions seem to enshrine corruption and blame lays squarely on the shoulders of the president. The big rot started with the Central Bank bond scam for which Ranil is responsible more than any other. It was he who imported Arjuna Mahendran from Singapore on false pretences. It is very interesting to note that Mahendran has come out of the woodwork since the election of Ranil by parliament and his writing to newspapers, on two different occasions, dared giving his full postal address!",
    "Ranil\u2019s behaviour since his appointment is no better, as well illustrated by his actions in defending the corrupt in Sri Lanka Cricket! Rohan Ranasinghe attempted to cleanse SLC and dared Ranil to choose between him and SLC chairman. Ranil replaced the sports minister with a henchman. They are all living happily ever after in corrupt Sri Lanka, where no profession seems spared! We were taken aback by the comments of a relative of ours who holds a high position in the legal profession; in referring to a well-known judge he said \u201cHe is a nice and affable fellow but well known for his weaknes to be bought over!\u201d Reminds of the Sinhala saying Wetath niyarath goyam kanam, kata kiyamuda ee amaruwa.",
    "My alma mater, Rahula College, Matara, inculcated discipline which has stood in good stead for all of us. Unfortunately, since the fifties there had been a gradual erosion in discipline. The undisciplined behaviour is best seen on the roads. There is not a single day without a fatality being reported due to an accident. Not that accidents do not occur in other countries but they are due to many other causes but in Sri Lanka most are due to bad driving. The other glaring example is the disgusting behaviour of our \u2018honourable\u2019 members of parliament. Is it not shocking when it is reported repeatedly that schoolchildren had to be escorted out of the public gallery; lest they learn the art of fighting and shouting filth from the elected representatives!",

    "Gullibility is inversely proportional to education and considering the high level of literacy and education in Sri Lanka, one would expect Sri Lankan to be only minimally gullible. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case, gullibility extending to the highest levels. I have held Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith in high esteem, as a voice of sanity, but some of his recent utterances no doubt reflects a degree of gullibility, being misled by some who have got close to him. The antics of the self-declared prophet Jerome Fernando (JF) and self-declared Arahant Pitiduwe Siridhamma (PS) demonstrate avidly the gullibility of some of our countrymen.",
    "PS was the first to declare that he is an arahant and many followed him including one Dr Perera! It was hilarious to see devotees lining up to receive blessings from these self-styled arahants. Six years ago, PS appeared before the hierarchy of Malwatu chapter and was given the final warning but the arahant continued his erratic behaviour. He was given the final warning, again, recently for publishing in Facebook a story that Siddhartha Bodhisattva had an illicit affair with Sujatha, who offered milk rice to him. A comedienne, whose satire was less offensive was taken in to custody but PS continues to be revered by his gullible followers. Perhaps, they respect him for his agrarian capabilities!",
    "JF was a prophet who could not see his own future and wonder what all the VIPs who were converted at his behest have to say! He became so powerful that he felt he could get away with insulting all religious leaders. Fearing arrest, he fled and then filed action to prevent arrest but withdrew the action when he realised that his preferred judge was abroad. On that judge\u2019s return, the action was resubmitted and granted on the assurance from CID that he would not be arrested on return. CID played it smart: they did not arrest on return but questioned him later and arrested! Even if he escapes justice, Inland Revenue is at him and he would have to explain how he accumulated such enormous wealth. Hope IR would get a good slice, which the country badly needs.",
    "There is an ongoing war against drug dealers and police seem to have found them very easily. As indicated in a previous editorial, why were they not apprehended before, if these criminals had been known to the police. It is a commendable action but there is a sniggering suspicion that the motive behind may be to justify the appointment of the acting IGP!",
