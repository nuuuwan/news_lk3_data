Officials warn there is a heightened risk of transmission to humans in areas surrounding the sacred city, where large groups of monkeys and toque macaques roam freely.

Therefore, wildlife authorities have urged the general public to be vigilant and take necessary precautions.

The overpopulation of monkeys and toque macaques has long been a persistent and unresolved issue in both Polonnaruwa and Giritale, exacerbating the current situation.

“The increasing, and if I may add, cynical use of vetoes by the P5 must be constrained,” said Dr Balakrishnan, adding that the wider UN membership must reach an agreement on how this veto is exercised in the future.

“Just as the world has changed dramatically in the last 80 years, it is also clear that the UN needs to reform to be fit for purpose for the next stretch,” he said. “We need a more representative and a more inclusive UN that reflects current realities.”

### Harry suggests people trying to sabotage reconciliation with King

The Duke of Sussex has suggested people are trying to sabotage his reconciliation with King Charles, as he described media reports about their recent meeting as “categorically false”.

Prince Harry met his father at Clarence House in London on 10 September, in their first face to face meeting since February 2024.

However, a report in the Sun on Saturday suggested the reunion had been more formal than expected, with the duke reportedly left feeling like he was being treated as an official visitor, rather than family.

In a statement, Prince Harry’s spokesperson said the claims were “pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son”.

The Sun newspaper said Prince Harry had confirmed aspects of its reporting. It said the duke’s office “was given full right of reply yesterday in advance of publication and opted not to give a response to the Sun’s carefully sourced account of the meeting”.
