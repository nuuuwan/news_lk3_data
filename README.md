### Cabinet Spokesman guarantees CEB bonuses will not hinder tariff relief for electricity users

The Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday guaranteed that the bonuses to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees will not hinder the relief promised to the electricity users.

He opined that the CEB should balance administrative responsibilities and trade union negotiations without affecting its commitments to the public or delaying critical decisions.

“Administration is one thing and trade union demands are another,” he said responding to a question raised at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said there is no direct connection between the trade union’s demand and the Board of Directors or the decision-makers.

“Trade unions are simply trying to secure their rights. However, managing these demands, while meeting the PUCSL’s deadline for proposals is the responsibility of the CEB,” he said.

### Poverty of CBSL’s monetary policies: Part II

*2024-11-27 06:09:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Poverty-of-CBSL-s-monetary-policies-Part-II/4-769738) · `en`

High domestic interest rates on Government debt, combined with the absence of Central Bank intervention to purchase newly issued debt, will escalate the domestic debt servicing burden

The present article expands on the loss of control by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) of interest rates that we developed in Part I. In Part I the focus was money market or short-term interest rates. In the present article the focus is long-term interest rates, particularly interest rates on long-term Government debt.

The article makes two key points in this regard. Firstly, the CBSL has not only lost control over money market or short-term interest rates, as argued in Part I, but also over long-term interest rates, specifically those on long-term Government debt i.e., on Government debt exceeding one year. Secondly, this loss of control stems partly from the CBSL’s inability to regulate short-term money market rates and partly from the provisions of the new Central Bank Act (CBA) passed in 2023.

### Blunder by new Government: No fertiliser to paddy farmers

*2024-11-27 06:02:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Blunder-by-new-Government-No-fertiliser-to-paddy-farmers/4-769737) · `en`

The current Government’s biggest blunder is the neglect of fertiliser to paddy farmers

Over the past few weeks, TV channel ‘Derana’ reported on a number of occasions, the plight of the paddy farmers in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Amparai districts due to non-availability of fertiliser for their paddy cultivation. But the Government TV channels were silent over the issue.

Maha rainy season started in early October as usual and will continue until early January. Rains start in early October during the evenings and intensity will increase reaching a maximum in December and rains will end in early January, allowing the farmers to harvest from late January onwards.

The paddy farmers prepare fields after first rains having softened the grounds, mostly with tractors. With increase in rains, fields become muddy and are prepared for sowing of seed paddy generally in early November.

### New regime and its representation problem

*2024-11-27 05:57:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-regime-and-its-representation-problem/4-769735) · `en`

The symbolic exclusion signalled by the missing Muslim at the highest level of governance is significant and no amount of patronising rhetoric about our collective Sri Lankanness is going to address this sense of exclusion

The change that the new election has brought to the country is unprecedented. We have a woman Prime Minister (that many of us in the academic and activist communities know) and we have several young women in Parliament. Historically, since independence, we have only had 5% representation at any given moment. Now we have close to 10%. And that too through elections and only one through the national list.

### Entrepreneurship in the 21st century

Last week marked Global Entrepreneurship Week; with our world on the brink of catastrophe in so many respects – conflict, climate, inequality – we have never needed the involvement of youth in defining entrepreneurial solutions to these problems, more than now. I was privileged to join the NIBM School of Business in exploring what entrepreneurship looks like from a practitioner’s perspective.

The good news is that everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. Less good is the reality that few know how. Most have gone through the motions – marketing, business administration, new media, and their social media dramatically quotes great entrepreneurs. One explains, ‘anything is possible’, another, ‘make the climb without the rope,’ and ‘let’s punch today in the face.’

### Cabinet nod to present Interim Budget for first four months  of 2025

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the formulation of an Interim Budget to cover the Government’s expenses during the first four months of 2025.

It will focus on relevant expenses for Government recurrent and capital expenses, public debt servicing, and loan restructuring.

The move comes as the new Parliament which convened on 21 November lacked sufficient time to complete the constitutional steps required for passing the full Appropriation Bill for 2025.

Therefore, as stipulated in sub-section 23(1) of the Public Finance Management Act No 44 of 2024, an interim Budget should be submitted to Parliament to allocate provisions for the continuation of currently implemented projects and public services for the first 4 months of 2025.

The proposal to this effect presented by the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

### In Sri Lanka ISB exchange, high creditor participation vital: IMF’s Georgieva

ECONOMYNEXT – High creditor participation in an exchange of defaulted sovereign bonds for new securities is vital for the success of the International Monetary Fund program for Sri Lanka, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

A debt exchange launched on November 27, will provide significant external debt service relief and further contribute to restore Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability, and was as step forward, she said.
