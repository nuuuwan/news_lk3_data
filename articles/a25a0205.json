  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath informed Parliament today (22) that the draft bill to repeal the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) will be published in the Government Gazette in the beginning of September.",
    "\u201cWe will make the necessary amendments and finalize them before the end of this month, after which the gazette notification to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be published in early September,\u201d the Minister stated.",
    "He further emphasized that, although the PTA is still being applied to a limited extent in the country, it is not being used to target any ethnic or religious communities.",
    "\u201cIt is currently used to combat organized crime and underworld activities. The majority of those arrested under the PTA are not Tamils or Muslims, but Sinhalese individuals involved in drug-related and underworld crimes,\u201d he clarified.",
    "Acknowledging the long-standing criticism of the act, Minister Herath noted, \u201cWe accept that the PTA is a law that must be changed. Therefore, we are in the process of repealing it. There is no debate about that.\u201d",
    "Additionally, he added that a new bill would soon be introduced to specifically address organized crime and drug trafficking.",
    "\u201cThe PTA is being used at present due to shortcomings in the existing legal framework to deal with such criminals. We are now moving to replace it with clearer and more effective legislation,\u201d he said."
