  "original_title": "Easter attacks: Petition against Nilantha Jayawardena fixed for consideration",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The petition filed seeking legal action against the former chief of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena with respect to the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks has been fixed for consideration by the Court of Appeal on May 28.",
    "It was taken up before a two-member judge bench consisting of Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola on Wednesday morning (27).",
    "The petition was filed by the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), its director Rev. Fr. Jude Vernon Rohan Silva and a victim of Easter attacks named Devage Surach Nilanga, naming the Inspector-Genral of Police (IGP), SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena and the Attorney General as its respondents.",
    "The writ application was put forward requesting that an order be issued to the IGP and other respondents directing them to take legal action against the former SIS chief, over his failure to prevent the coordinated bombings five years ago, despite receiving intelligence information.",
    "The petitioners alleged that the respondents have yet to take legal action against Jayawardena, despite sufficient evidence supporting the fact that he failed to prevent the attacks. As such, they have requested the Appeals Court to deliver an order instructing the respondents to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "The petitioners also have sought a writ order calling for the arrest of Jayawardena under the Criminal Law and subsequent legal action against him."
