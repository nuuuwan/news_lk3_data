    "In reference to the Presidential pardon given to the LTTE member convicted for 200 years in prison for his involvement in the Central Bank bomb blast that killed 91 persons and injured 200 others, Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa said the same relief should be extended to soldiers whom he cited as war heroes.",
    "Making his remarks to the media, Mr. Rajapaksa said he was also in remand prison once along with some LTTE cadres.",
    "\u201cThere is no harm in releasing LTTE cadres in jail. Likewise, there are some war heroes imprisoned after being convicted over various allegations. I believe the President should pardon them too at this juncture.\u00a0 We have to close this chapter in our history,\u201d he said.(Kelum Bandara)"
