    "Leema Creations Chairman Channa Wijesekara with guests make a toast at the celebration",
    "In a flamboyant celebration of creativity, resilience, and innovation, Leema Creations, the premier interior solution provider in the field of interior design, has announced its Silver Jubilee \u2014 25 years of transforming spaces and touching lives. The company will mark this milestone with a series of events under the theme \u2018Space-Life-Story.\u2019",
    "Founded in 2000, Leema Creations has become synonymous with refined aesthetics, customer-centric solutions, and a deep understanding of how interiors shape the way people live, work, and thrive. From humble beginnings, Leema has become the most sought-after and trusted name in residential, commercial, and hospitality interior design.",
    "The founding vision of Channa Wijesekara, a veteran in wood technology, was simple at the start 25 years ago, yet it was revolutionary. The small squad that started with him in 2000 has grown into a multidisciplinary team of over 350 professionals, serving customers across Sri Lanka and in the regional markets.",
    "The organisation has evolved into a 200,000 sq. ft. megastructure with ultramodern machinery and equipment in just 25 years. At present, the company operates under the certification and guidelines of ISO 9001:2015.",
    "Throughout its 25-year victorious journey, Leema has delivered many landmark projects ranging from high-end residences, corporate headquarters, and luxury hotels to retail stores, hospitals, and public institutions. Each project has added to the company\u2019s rich legacy of creating spaces that blend functionality and modernity with elegance.",
    "Founder Chairman Channa Wijesekara said: \u201cIn 2000, when the interior industry was a luxury reserved for elites, I took an audacious decision to leave public service and launch Leema Creations as a small-scale business enterprise. With my two-year educational initiative in Germany on wood technology and subsequent training programs in Germany, the Philippines, and Thailand, and the civil engineering background, I realised that my future lies in business. Thus, we are here now.\u201d",
    "He added, \u201cOur journey has been about more than just spaces and furniture. It\u2019s about storytelling through space, about translating personality and purpose into functionality.\u201d",
    "Leema management took this fitting opportunity to express its deep gratitude to the loyal clientele, the lifeblood of the organisation, for placing trust in them from the beginning. They also immensely appreciated the support given by the architect fraternity in Sri Lanka for extending their support, guidance, and advice throughout the period.",
    "Leema also paid tribute to the banking sector for demonstrating empathy and action, particularly during the start-up period and the times of distress, and throughout the 25-year journey.",
    "Whilst looking back at the past, Leema Creations is firmly focused on the future as well with a vibrant new chapter. Their intention is to invest in sustainable design practices and digital visualisation with eco-conscious material. The company also plans to expand design lines with furniture and decor that reflect Sri Lankan craftsmanship on a global platform."
