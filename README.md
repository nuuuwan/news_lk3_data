According to doctors, four to five deaths were reported last week at a hotel at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital last week due to high heat.

This was announced at a special media briefing held at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital on Monday.

Further, the current temperature is likely to increase the body temperature and cause heat stroke.

We have lost many patients who have been admitted to our hostels through heat stroke. Temperature is likely to increase in the future.

The increase in the use of plastic and polythene and the destruction of high -level trees is currently increased by temperature. Therefore, all people should plant homemade trees and keep the environment cool.

In the last two weeks, we have lost four to five patients who have been admitted to our patient hostels due to heat stroke.

People who are older do not know how to thirst for water. So to provide water foods continuously. Doing so can reduce the body's heat and prevent heat stroke.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s mobile banking users have been warned of hackers who are hi-jacking their phones and taking over bank accounts.

“We have been alerted regarding several incidents of financial fraud, both globally and in Sri Lanka, disguised as attractive online offers, leading to mobile device users inadvertently clicking on unknown links and downloading malicious apps and files,” a joint statement from Sri Lanka Banks Association, Lanka Pay and FinCSIRT said.

“This action grants scammers complete access to the mobile device, enabling them to control it remotely.

“Once the fraudsters take control of the mobile device, they have easy access to bank/payment apps that are installed on that device, leading to theft from bank accounts and payment cards accessed via the mobile device.”

Following is the full text of a statement issued by Immigration and Emigration Department Controller General I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya yesterday on the Government’s decision to work with VFS Global for processing of visa applications for visitors to Sri Lanka

Subsequently, there was a strong requirement to introduce a new methodology due to the fact that this program was not updated timely to meet the technical requirements of the Department. This requirement was further intensified with the introduction of a new visa methodology.

As Sri Lanka braces itself for the Presidential Election, we, the public must vote for deeds – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

When electing our next President, vote for execution, not persona

Given the contextual importance of the upcoming presidential polls which, barring the unanticipated, is scheduled to take place around end-September or early October this year, it is not surprising that the key talking points at public and private gatherings, in newspaper articles, television chat shows and social media blogs are “Who among the candidates would serve Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan citizens best as the country’s President?” and “Who are you voting for?”

### Electricity sector: Without investment we will be in the dark again

*2024-05-07 05:14:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Electricity-sector-Without-investment-we-will-be-in-the-dark-again/4-761485) · `en`

From the fact the Sri Lankan developers of wind farms source many of the needed inputs from India, it should be

evident that the eco system of supportive manufacturers is well established there and not here

The 13-hour power cuts two years ago should have educated us on the importance of reliable power supply. But we forget after two weeks, it is said.

What is being done to ensure that will not happen again, including lessening dependence on imported fossil fuel, may not be perfect. But it is important to call out egregiously misguided criticisms. If such attacks succeed as they did 20 years ago, we will continue to suffer the consequences of a bad legal framework, resulting workarounds, and underinvestment in generation, transmission, and distribution. The blocking of new baseload plants from the 1990s served no one’s interests, other than perhaps of the so-called diesel mafia. We all paid for that. We continue to pay.

### Hollow rupee: High cost of mandatory currency conversions on Sri Lanka’s ability to earn foreign exchange

*2024-05-07 05:06:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Hollow-rupee-High-cost-of-mandatory-currency-conversions-on-Sri-Lanka-s-ability-to-earn-foreign-exchange/14-761483) · `en`

The impact of these dynamics will be felt in terms of reduced export revenue, within approximately nine months – which is the typical lead time on apparel orders

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currency’s strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.
