    "June 05 - A gunman was captured after opening fire at the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, on Wednesday \u2014 an attack that took place as U.S. ally Israel signaled it could soon launch an offensive in the country against Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.",
    "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned early Wednesday that Israel was \"prepared for very intense action in the north,\" as he visited a border city hit by wildfires sparked by Hezbollah rockets.",
    "The escalation has piled pressure on Netanyahu from right-wing members of his government, who have also threatened to quit if he agrees to the U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal. President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu in an interview published Tuesday, but also dispatched top aides to the region for new talks with mediators as Washington pushes for a deal that would end eight months of fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas."
