The session took place at the auditorium of the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), with around 200 Sri Lankan export companies.",
    "The European Union has introduced regulations that will have a significant impact on the Sri Lankan export sector, particularly as ESG considerations. The event provided a platform to discuss the critical challenges and opportunities that the export industry will encounter as a result of the EU\u2019s new ESG regulations.",
    "A team of experts from KPMG Sri Lanka, including Partner Pyumi Sumanasekara, Director Shazaad Nanzer, Senior Manager Callishia Fernando, and Deputy Manager Fathima Mohideen, conducted informative sessions to guide participants through the complexities of the new EU regulations and ESG factors. The sessions provided valuable insights into the latest EU regulations, including their implications for the export industry. The sessions were enriched with compelling real-world case studies, covering key topics such as human rights, supply chain dynamics, decarbonisation, and manpower challenges etc. Participants were informed of practical steps they can take to prepare for these changes, along with the risks and opportunities arising from the evolving regulatory landscape.",

He reiterated the EDB\u2019s commitment to awareness and encourages Sri Lankan companies to adopt sustainable business practices in compliance with ESG standards.",

By understanding and addressing ESG factors, companies can improve their image, attract investors, and contribute to a more sustainable future.",
