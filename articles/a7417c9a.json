  "original_body_lines": [
    "Iran has raised the death toll from Israel\u2019s attack to four and said all served in the country\u2019s military air defense.",
    "The state-run IRNA news agency announced the deaths Saturday night. It offered no details on where the four men were stationed in the country.",
    "Israel attacked military targets in Iran with pre-dawn airstrikes in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired on Israel earlier this month. The strikes marked the first time Israel\u2019s military has openly attacked Iran.",
    "Following the airstrikes, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it had a right to self-defense, and \u201cconsiders itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression.\u201d There was no official statement by the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s commanders.",
    "Israel\u2019s military said it targeted facilities that Iran used to make the missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or nuclear sites were hit, which would have marked a much more serious escalation.",
    "Explosions could be heard in Tehran until sunrise. The Islamic Republic said the attacks caused \u201climited damage.\u201d Iran\u2019s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, without elaborating.",
    "Iran\u2019s army said two soldiers were killed, Iran\u2019s Al-Alam television reported.",
    "The strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran \u2014 including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon \u2014 are already at war with Israel.",
    "U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like \u201cthey didn\u2019t hit anything but military targets.\u201d He said he had just finished a call with intelligence officials.",
    "Iran hadn\u2019t faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq.",
    "On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation for devastating blows Israel landed against Hezbollah. They caused minimal damage and a few injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran \u201cmade a big mistake.\u201d",
    "Israel is also widely thought to be behind a limited airstrike in April near a major air base in Iran that hit the radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery. Iran had fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel in April, causing minimal damage, after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria.",
    "\u201cIran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,\u201d Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. He added: \u201cIf the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.\u201d",
    "Images released by Israel\u2019s military showed members preparing to depart for the strikes in American-made F-15 and F-16 warplanes.",
    "Israel\u2019s attack did not take out highly visible or symbolic facilities that could prompt a significant response from Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at Tel Aviv\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies who formerly worked for Israel\u2019s National Security Council.",
    "It also gives Israel room for escalation if needed, and targeting air defense systems weakens Iran\u2019s capabilities to defend against future attacks, he said, adding that if there is Iranian retaliation, it should be limited.",
    "Israel has again shown its military precision and capabilities are superior to Iran\u2019s, said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
    "\u201cBy targeting military sites and missile facilities over nuclear and energy infrastructure, Israel is also messaging that it seeks no further escalation for now,\u201d Vakil said. \u201cThis is a sign that the diplomacy and back-channel efforts to moderate the strike were successful.\u201d",
    "Biden\u2019s administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations.",
    "After the strikes, the streets in Iran\u2019s capital were calm and children went to school and shops opened. There were long lines at the gas stations \u2014 a regular occurrence in Tehran when military violence flares as people stock up on fuel. But some Tehran residents seemed anxious and avoided conversations with an Associated Press reporter.",
    "Israel\u2019s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, criticized the decision to avoid \u201cstrategic and economic targets,\u201d saying on X that \u201cwe could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran.\u201d",
    "The United States warned against further retaliation, and Britain and Germany said Iran should not respond. \u201cAll acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop,\u201d the spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general said.",
    "Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran\u2019s \u201csovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.\u201d",
    "Both Hezbollah and Hamas condemned Israel\u2019s attack, with Hezbollah saying it would not affect Tehran\u2019s support for Lebanese and Palestinians fighting Israel.",
    "In Lebanon, dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
    "Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut.",
    "Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran its greatest threat, citing its leaders\u2019 calls for Israel\u2019s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country\u2019s nuclear program.",
    "During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged.",
    "Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for attacks on shipping in the Middle East, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor.",
    "The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all hostages are freed. Some 100 remain, about a third believed to be dead.",
    "More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in largely devastated Gaza, according to local health officials, who don\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half have been women and children."
