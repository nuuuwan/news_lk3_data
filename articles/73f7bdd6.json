    "With the aim of promoting investment opportunities in Sri Lanka and building confidence among current and potential investors, the German Industry and Commerce Delegation to Sri Lanka (AHK Sri Lanka) organised a three-day delegation to the Hannover Messe from 24th to 26th April. AHK Sri Lanka had invited the Minister of State for Investor Promotion, Dilum Amunugama, to lead the delegation along with other government officials and representation of the Sri Lankan business community. This was the first time that Sri Lanka had officially participated at the Hannover Messe which is considered to be the world\u2019s leading industrial trade fair.",
    "During the visit, AHK Sri Lanka organised meetings with potential investors such as Hamburg Port Consulting, Linde Engineering, and SAP, and facilitated site visits to prominent establishments such as Continental Tires, one of the world\u2019s largest tire manufacturers. These engagements provided valuable insights into Sri Lanka\u2019s business environment and investment opportunities, further bolstering investor confidence.",
    "State Minister Amunugama observed that as Germany is the industrial powerhouse of* Europe and given Sri Lanka\u2019s target of encouraging export led economic growth, Sri Lanka has much to gain from strengthening trade and business linkages with Germany.",
    "During the meetings with German trade associations and businesses, the State Minister stated that Sri Lanka remains committed to international sustainability standards of green economy, strong labour rights, inclusive growth and mentioned the country\u2019s record as one of the most ethical sourcing destinations. He added that Sri Lanka\u2019s key product to the EU under GSP+, apparel, has earned the reputation of garments without guilt. He also stated that Sri Lanka is implementing necessary reforms to ensure long-term stability of the economy, while highlighting that Sri Lanka possesses great potential for creation of renewable energy such as green hydrogen.",
