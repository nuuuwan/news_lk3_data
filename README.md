### Trump heads for historic second UK state visit

Donald Trump will get the red carpet treatment this week on an unprecedented second United Kingdom state visit, as Britain counts on royal pomp and circumstance to woo the unpredictable United States president.

From a flyby and carriage ride with King Charles III to a grand state banquet at historic Windsor Castle, Britain is pulling out all the stops to flatter Trump, who has long been fascinated with the monarchy.

The aim is to keep Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Trump’s good side when they meet at the British leader’s country residence for talks centred on trade, tariffs and the Ukraine war.

Trump will also be kept far away from crowds and protesters, with all the action taking place outside London, where a large demonstration against the 79-year-old Republican is set to take place.

Labour leader Starmer is not a natural bedfellow for right-wing firebrand Trump, but he has worked hard to win him over since the US president returned to the White House in January.

*2025-09-15 09:01:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225104) · `ta`

Rice manufacturers have avoided selling Giri Samba rice because they are offering a control price of the Keeri Samba at a price of more than 260 rupees.

Considering this situation, retailers are also avoiding selling Keeri samba rice.

In such a situation, the Rice Manufacturers Association has asked the government to remove the maximum retail price imposed on the Samba and Keeri Samba rice.

However, the Sri Lankan small and medium -sized paddy plant owners association is demanding that no measures take any steps to eliminate the maximum retail price of rice as the owners of large -scale rice mill owners are trying to make a profit.

In this context, the National Farmers' Union has demanded that the government immediately resolve the issue.

### Sri Lanka central bank buys US$781mn less to August 2025 than last year

*2025-09-15 05:30:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-buys-us781mn-less-to-august-2025-than-last-year-240490/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank bought 142.5 million US dollars from commercial banks in August 2025, taking the total so far this year to 1,238.6 million US dollars so far this year, official data show.

In 2024, the central bank bought 2020.4 million US dollars in the same period with stronger deflationary policy and lower private credit.

In late 2024 the central bank re-started inflationary policy through aggressive open market operations to mis-target the interbank rate, as private credit picked up, leading to sharply reduced collections in November and December.

However, in 2025, there was no inflationary policy per se, other than dollar-rupee buy-sell swaps. Dollar purchases were also unsterilized under the latest phase of the IMF program no longer requiring a sell down of CB held g-secs, which analysts say is a mistake.

In the midst of an increase in the price of equipment, production costs have also increased. Along with this, the elephant-human conflict is facing severe problems and agriculture is taking place amid difficulties.. However, there is no guaranteed price for paddy harvest today.

### Repeal of Presidents’ Entitlements Act: Reform or retrospective punishment?

In considering the repeal of the Presidents’ Entitlements Act, the nation must weigh the difference between cutting extravagance and eroding respect. Historical judgment is unforgiving, and societies are often remembered not just for their policies but for their treatment of those who served them at great personal cost. Stripping entitlements retroactively, however well-intentioned, risks leaving a record of pettiness rather than prudence

In recent months, the repeal of Sri Lanka’s Presidents’ Entitlements Act has sparked intense debate across political and social circles. At first glance, the move seems a demonstration of fiscal prudence—a government taking decisive steps to curb what many perceive as excessive privileges.

### Independent central bank is for citizens and not for politicians

Three years ago, in 2022, inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index or CCPI was running on average at about 63% and the official exchange rate was unstable with a lucrative black market for foreign currencies. All indications were that Sri Lanka, unless proper policies would be adopted, would descend to a basket case like Lebanon. This did not happen because the central bank’s management, with financial as well as policy support of the International Monetary Fund or IMF, was able to tame the rising inflation and keep the exchange rate at a stable level

In a recent talk show titled ‘Modern Talk’ hosted by Channel 7 television, successor to the former YA Television, the young talk show hostess Nimna Perera asked me whether the current central bank management had been doing its job properly in managing the economy.1

Both students in Bangla and youth in Nepal were ultimately represented by small groups the military accepted and were projected as instruments of change

In Bangladesh and in Nepal, though with commonalities in the initial “leaderless” single issue protests, establishing a new rule was different to Sri Lanka and remains unconstitutional too. From nowhere a few youth in Bangladesh claiming to represent the university student protest and accepted as such by the military usurped the right to nominate Muhammud Yunus, the former head of the Grameen Bank as interim PM. He was in self-exile in France, and there were no indications of any discussions and dialogue among students and protesting groups, on who should head the interim government and how it should be constituted

United National Party (UNP) Chairman Vajira Abeywardena said that sowing jealousy and hatred in the hearts of the people could not benefit Sri Lanka.

We know about the tragic situation that took place last week in Nepal. The same incident took place in our country 3 years ago. When the situation returns to the serious state, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister of our country, quickly took steps to stop the burning of others after his home was burnt.

So the entire nation must be honored with Ranil Wickremesinghe, who protected our country from that situation and brought it on the right path.. Causing problems is the highlight of a democratic community. It must be remembered that controlling them is a highlight of a democratic society.

### Independent Central Bank Is For Citizens & Not For Politicians

In a recent talk show titled ‘Modern Talk’ hosted by Channel 7 television, successor to the former YA Television, the young talk show hostess Nimna Perera asked me whether the current central bank management had been doing its job properly in managing the economy.[1]

As a journalist, she was voicing the sentiments of the public openly in that talk show. There should not be objection to this approach because that is the duty of an anchor-woman by her viewers. In answering her question, I summarily told her that the central bank is an independent organisation as mandated by the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act or CBA and, under the mandate given to it by the new legislation, it is doing perfectly well in taming inflation and restoring the stability of the exchange rate. However, it requires further elaboration.

### Importance Of Sri Lankan Studies In School & University Curricula: A Justice-Oriented Civic Transformation

*2025-09-14 20:21:49* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/importance-of-sri-lankan-studies-in-school-university-curricula-a-justice-oriented-civic-transformation/) · `en`

The Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka has announced a national education reform initiative scheduled for implementation in 2026. Within this context, this paper argues for the integration of Sri Lankan Studies as a compulsory subject at both secondary and tertiary levels of education. The rationale derives from comparative international experiences where structured national studies such as American Studies, Chinese Studies, and Russian Studies are institutionalized to cultivate civic consciousness, strengthen national identity, and enhance democratic participation. Sri Lanka, despite its complex postcolonial trajectory and protracted ethnic conflict, lacks a coherent academic framework that synthesizes its history, cultural plurality, political institutions, and developmental challenges. Existing subjects such as Civic Education remain fragmented, outdated, and inadequate in fostering justice-oriented citizenship.
