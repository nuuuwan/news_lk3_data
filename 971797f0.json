    "The hemp industry is a cost-effective and socially responsible business that can help mitigate climate change, representing a shift in our current system to a circular economy. The versatile nature of hemp potentially represents multi-billion dollars downstream markets, particularly in manufacturing of reusable, recyclable and compostable biomaterials",
    "Ayurveda is a natural system of medicine that originated nearly 3,000 years ago, it has long attributed different parts of the hemp plant to a variety of curative purposes. In fact, the Vedas, estimated to be at least 3,400 years old, refer to it as one of the five most sacred plants.",
    "\u201cHemp\u201d is defined as a Cannabis sativa L. plant \u2013 or any part of the plant \u2013 in which the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is less than the regulated maximum level. Although Cannabis is used as a drug as it contains a psychoactive component, industrial hemp is a distinct strain with unique phytochemical compositions and uses. Similarly, industrial hemp should not be confused with \u201cdrug-type\u201d cannabis, commonly known as \u201cmarijuana\u201d (Cannabis Indica), which is a variety of Cannabis with very high levels of THC (up to 20%).",
    "Due to the similarities between industrial hemp (fibre and grain) and the narcotic/medical type of Cannabis, the production of industrial hemp was prohibited in most countries, wiping out centuries of learning and genetic resources. In the past two decades, most countries have legalised industrial hemp production, prompting a significant amount of research on the health benefits of hemp and hemp products.",
    "The controversial association of industrial hemp with medical Cannabis has also slowed expansion efforts. Therefore, breeding of hemp to clearly differentiate it from medical Cannabis may accelerate its development and consumer acceptance, as well as ease regulatory barriers of the crop.",
    "There are 75 different hemp varieties registered in the EU Catalogue and all of them have a low THC content (currently up to 0.2%), which means it is not psychoactive. All parts of the plant \u2013 stalks, seeds, flowers and leaves \u2013 can be harvested and processed, making hemp a versatile plant with multiple uses. This means that a single crop has the potential to produce a wide range of products. Due to its versatility and its functional characteristics, the industrial hemp market holds vast potential in agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverages, paper, construction materials and personal care.",
    "The hemp industry is a cost-effective and socially responsible business that can help mitigate climate change, representing a shift in our current system to a circular economy. The versatile nature of hemp potentially represents multi-billion dollars downstream markets, particularly in manufacturing of reusable, recyclable and compostable biomaterials.",
    "Being so diverse, industrial hemp can be a revolutionary plant for a better future and upcoming generations. Due to its immense contributions, hemp is emerging as a vital agricultural commodity. It is an eco-friendly and worthwhile crop that complements sustainable growth system. Growing hemp can improve local economy and create job possibilities, particularly in agriculture-dependent areas. The revival of this centuries-old multifaceted crop can be a turning point and shows ways to change the livelihood of farmers worldwide. The bene\ufb01ts of hemp production will improve farmers\u2019 socio-economic status and may potentially contribute to a signi\ufb01cant increase in GDP per capita.",
    "Industrial hemp can be used for its fibre, seed, or oil. Over time, industrial hemp has evolved into an even greater variety of products, including health foods, organic body care, clothing, construction materials, biofuels, plastic composites, and more.",
    "The market is experiencing growth due to several factors, including the functional characteristics of hemp seeds and hemp seed oil, their numerous benefits, and their expanding utilisation in commercial applications. Moreover, the market is experiencing growth driven by the increasing demand for hemp-based products, which offer various health benefits and cater to the rising prevalence of conditions like epilepsy and sleep disorders.",
    "The demand for hemp has seen a significant surge in recent times. During the pandemic, people turned to hemp products for its various benefits, which fuelled its adoption. Regulations of several countries started enabling research and medical cultivation, opening doors for further exploration. Furthermore, the legalisation of hemp in several global markets, including the US, EU, and Canada, has attracted players and investments to the sector.",
    "Industrial hemp production has remained legal throughout most of the world. Approximately 30 countries in Europe, Asia, and North and South America allow farmers to grow hemp. The world hemp fibre market continues to be dominated by China. Other notable countries include France, Germany, the UK, The Netherlands, Chile, and South Korea.",
    "In July 2018, Uttarakhand became the first Indian state to legalise hemp farming. Naturally, it is now the largest hemp producing state in India. Since then, several other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar, have also shown interest in legalising hemp cultivation.",
    "As it stands, Sri Lanka has strict restrictions on the cultivation of cannabis, with exemptions permitted for indigenous medicines. Currently, Sri Lankan lawmakers are drawing up proposals that could see medical cannabis cultivation and exportation legalised. The move is significant, as it could pave the way for the commercial production of hemp in the country and allow farmers to tap into the lucrative global hemp market. It could also lead to the creation of new jobs and revenue streams for Sri Lanka which we direly need right now as well as promote sustainable agriculture practices.",
    "Hemp is not only a treasure for the industrial sector but also a perfect plant for sustainable farming systems. The benefits of industrial hemp cultivation will uplift the socio-economic level of the farmers and can even significantly increase the GDP per capita of Sri Lanka",
    "Economic benefits of the hemp industry to the economy of Sri Lanka",
    "The global industrial hemp market size is projected to grow from $ 7.90 billion in 2023 to $ 31.98 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 22.11% during the forecast period. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is a way to measure how an investment or business has grown over a specific period of time. One of the main drivers of the economic benefits of growing it is the rapid growth of the CBD market. CBD, or cannabidiol, is a non-psychoactive compound in hemp and marijuana. It is believed to have many health benefits, from reducing pain and inflammation to alleviating anxiety and depression. As a result, the CBD market has exploded in recent years, with sales projected to reach $ 20 billion by 2024.",
    "Cultivating hemp is a promising new opportunity for farmers. The crop is relatively easy to grow and requires less water and pesticides than traditional crops such as cotton. In addition, it can grow in a wide range of climates, from hot and dry to cool and damp. It means that farmers struggling with their current crops due to drought or disease can turn to hemp production, which is a sustainable alternative. It can also be a great opportunity for small-scale farmers. The crop requires less land and resources than traditional crops, which means that even small plots of land can become hemp farms. It can be particularly beneficial for small-scale farmers struggling to compete with larger, industrialised farms.",
    "Hemp farming has the potential to improve water conservation in several ways. Hemp has deep roots, which help prevent soil erosion and retain moisture. It is particularly important in areas prone to drought or water scarcity. This means it requires less irrigation than other crops, which can help conserve water resources.",
    "4. Superior substitute to paper and more cost-efficient than cotton",
    "It is an excellent substitute for paper, which is traditionally made from wood pulp. It grows quickly and can be harvested in just 3-4 months. Furthermore, it requires fewer chemicals and less energy to produce, making it a more sustainable and eco-friendly option. It is an efficient and cost-effective crop to grow, with a yield of up to 4 times more than cotton per acre. Moreover, it requires less water and fewer pesticides and grows faster than cotton. It is also more resilient to pests and diseases, so farmers can save money on expensive chemicals and treatments. In addition, the whole hemp plant can be used for various products, including food, textiles, and building materials. Farmers can, therefore, maximise their profits by selling multiple products from a single crop.",
    "Industrial hemp can help mitigate the effects of climate change, as it captures significant amounts of carbon dioxide by storing it in both stems and roots during photosynthesis. Industrial hemp may capture more carbon dioxide per hectare than other commercial crops or some forests. Carbon storage is one hectare of hemp sequesters 9 to 15 tons of CO2, similar to the amount sequestered by a young forest, but it only takes five months to grow.",
    "Hemp helps to break the cycle of diseases when used in crop rotation. In addition, weeds are not able to grow next to hemp due to the fast growth and shading capacity of hemp plants.",
    "Flowering cycle usually occurs between July and September, coinciding with a lack of pollen production from other crops. Hemp produces large amounts of pollen. It also provides shelter for birds and hemp seeds are food for animals, which encourages higher biodiversity.",
    "Hemp is susceptible to fewer pests because of the lack of natural predators, which means that the use of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides can be avoided in most cases, thereby decreasing pollution levels.",
    "Hemp is extremely suitable as a rest crop, because of its deep rooting, hemp cultivation contributes greatly to soil organic matter accumulation. The hemp plant can return previously leached nitrogen back into the mineral cycle. Being a fast-growing crop and having a high leaf turnover rate, hemp can, if grown in ideal conditions, fully cover the ground for three weeks post-germination. Hemp can also be used with great efficiency in land reclamation. Hemp stabilises erosion. In fact, it is considered as an optimal pioneer crop, notably because of its phytoremediation capacity. Phytoremediation means plants which absorb pollutants and thus clean the environment.",
    "Its processing generates zero waste. All parts of hemp, from the roots to the flowers, can be used or further transformed. That is why the real added value of industrial hemp is its ability to produce different products with one crop: food, feed, cosmetics, biomaterials, energy while achieving positive environmental externalities with one rotational crop.",
    "Industrial hemp can contribute to food security. Hempseeds are rich in essential fatty acids (omega 3 and omega 6), proteins, carbohydrates (particularly insoluble fibres), vitamins and minerals.",
    "Hemp is not only a treasure for the industrial sector but also a perfect plant for sustainable farming systems. The benefits of industrial hemp cultivation will uplift the socio-economic level of the farmers and can even significantly increase the GDP per capita of Sri Lanka.",
    "Industrial hemp is a multi-purpose crop. The unique properties of the plant make it a highly valuable and sustainable crop. There are more than 25,000 hemp-based products available in markets worldwide. It is an eco-friendly and worthwhile crop that complements a sustainable growth system. Industrial hemp farming has the potential to dramatically minimise the amount of carbon impact on the environment and can be cultivated with little or no usage of chemical pesticides or fertilisers.",
    "The growth of the hemp industry, however, will depend primarily on the legislative structure. We should realise the importance of this amazing plant and initiate marketing and growth policies that will be beneficial for both our economy and the environment. There is a need for a comprehensive policy framework that addresses issues such as THC content, licensing, and infrastructure development. The Government should also work towards creating awareness about the benefits of industrial hemp and its various applications, which could help increase demand for Sri Lankan hemp products in the global market."
