We need a generation with the creative intelligence to question the accuracy and reliability of that data, to see things differently, and to use information to change the world. We need people with curiosity about the world, people who can think outside of the box, looking at things in a new way, and pursuing knowledge, information, and data with purpose.\u201d",
