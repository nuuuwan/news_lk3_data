  "original_body_lines": [
    "1981, was a quieter year, where most of the policy decisions taken earlier were being implemented. There were, however, one or two points of interest. One of these related to the Minister\u2019s health. Mr. Herat was a person who was always properly dressed in a lounge suit. Most of the time, he worked in office, wearing his full suit. Occasionally, he used to hang up his coat, until he put it on again when he was leaving.",
    "I began to notice that the Minister was breaking out into a sweat even when the air conditioner in the room had made the room quite cold. I ignored this, until one day when we were working in a freezing room at about 7.30 p.m. he was visibly perspiring badly. The coat which he had on could not have accounted for it. Therefore, this time I directly asked him what the matter was. He told me an extraordinary story.",
    "Prior to the general elections of 1977, one of his political opponents in his electorate of Hiriyala, had put some rat poison into a bottle of orange barley served to him at a political meeting. Only his strong constitution had saved him from death, and the then Leader of the Opposition, and current President, and his friends had flown him to Britain, where he had received expert treatment in a hospital at Liverpool. He had recovered in time to contest the elections. His doctors had however urged him to come over for an annual check. This he had not done for a period of nearly three years.",
    "I was shocked to hear this. It was quite clear that his system was now under considerable strain. I urged that he should go immediately. He said that lie does not want to bother the President and that he",
    "will think about this later. I said that wouldn\u2019t do, and that unless he spoke with the President during the next day or two, I would talk to his Secretary Mr. Menikdiwela. He didn\u2019t want me to do so. Therefore, I informed him that according to my interpretation, among the many and varied duties of a Secretary, there included also a responsibility for preventing his minister committing suicide.",
    "I added that now that I knew the situation I considered it my duty to bring his condition to the attention of the proper authorities. He was still unhappy, wanting to postpone matters. At the same time, he realized that on this matter, I was not going to listen to him. Therefore, the very next day I rang Mr. Menikdiwela and told him the story. He was quite upset at the Minister\u2019s negligence and he said that the President would be upset too.",
    "Mr. Herat was an honourable and genial person and widely liked. The ordinary people liked him too and whatever the swing of opinion in politics he had never lost his seat. I also had a solution to offer to Mr. Menikdiwela. We were due to go to Washington in about two weeks time for the PL 480 tender, and appointments fixed for me with numerous persons and agencies there. I said that the minister could lead the delegation. Since we were going through London, he could go ahead of us and get his checks and tests done and we could join up in London to go to Washington.",
    "Whilst in Washington, the Minister could be exposed to a variety of experiences pertaining to the purchase and shipment of wheat, and meet with senior personnel in the various US Agencies. Mr. Menikdiwela said that this was an excellent suggestion, and that was what was decided. I heard later that the President had gently chided Mr. Herat on his negligence. We also heard that he went to his doctors in the nick of time and his life was saved. But, unfortunately, more liver damage had taken place, and the annual visits which now began only helped to prolong his life till June 1983. He was active to the last.",
    "Before I pass on to other things, it would be appropriate at this point to deal with his death. In the first week of June 1983. Mr. Pulendiran by now the Food Commissioner, Mr. Thenuwara our Legal Advisor; Mrs. Kuruppu Deputy Director of External Resources in the Ministry of Finance, and I were in London on our way to Washington, for the PL 480 negotiations and tender.",
    "The minister was undergoing treatment in hospital at Liverpool. On the day we were due to leave for Washington, we had a 11.30 a.m. flight from Heathrow. I was fast asleep in bed early in the morning, when the bedside telephone rang. I noticed the time was 6.15 a.m. It was Mr. Atugoda of the Foreign Service who was an officer in our High Commission. What he had to say stunned me. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cI have some very sad news. The minister passed away at 5 a.m.\u201d",
    "When I recovered speech and capacity for action, I realized that we had to take an immediate decision, whether under these sad circumstances, we were to proceed to Washington or accompany the minister\u2019s body back to Sri Lanka. I told Mr. Atugoda to immediately contact the Secretary to the President and seek instructions. He said, he would get back. I didn\u2019t want to break the news just yet to my colleagues. Some of them could be asleep. I telephoned Liverpool and spoke to Dr. Herat, brother of the minister and to his sister who were there.",
    "A while later Mr. Atugoda came back with the information that we were to proceed to Washington, because important official matters could not be postponed. At about 7 a.m. I spoke to the members of the delegation. They were as shocked and as sad as I was. The minister was universally liked. He was very friendly, cordial and helpful to public servants. During the entire seven-hour flight to Washington, we hardly conversed. Normally, on these flights we used to laugh and joke. Now, everybody was in a sombre mood wrapped in their own thoughts.",
    "It was difficult to imagine that the Minister was no more. In Washington Ambassador Ernest Corea shared our heaviness- of heart. He had met the minister several times and liked him enormously. We, in the delegation felt that we should give a dana or alms giving to some Buddhist monks, in accordance with Buddhist custom, in order to transfer merit to the departed minister. Ambassador Corea, a non-Buddhist supported this fully and enthusiastically. He thought it was a noble thought, and said that he and his wife would also contribute. We were going to use a part of our personal allowances for this purpose.",
    "All of us felt that it was important to do so. We were not going to use any Embassy funds. The minister\u2019s funeral however was going to be somewhat delayed, because the body had to be sent to Sri Lanka, and after lying in state in Colombo, it was to be taken to his parliamentary constituency of Hiriyala for cremation. The question arose as to whether it was proper for us to have a dana in his memory, before the body was cremated and the customary danas were held at home.",
    "I was entrusted with the task of discussing this with the chief incumbent of the Washington Buddhist Vihare. He advised me that it was perfectly in order for anyone to give a dana at anytime. So it was organized at the Washington Vihare on a Saturday morning. Some Sri Lankans, who had heard of the occasion, also turned up with cooked food and sweet meats. The chief incumbent in his sermon spoke philosophically of the realities and vicissitudes of life. He mentioned the fact that the minister was born in one country, died in another and now a dana on his behalf was taking place in a third country.",
    "Then referring to us, he said that this dana we had organized using our own funds was of particular value since it was obviously done with great purity of heart, and without any expectations of reward or recompense, because the minister was dead, and there was no assistance he could render to us or no favour he could grant. He was right. He had penetrated to the heart of the matter. What we did was out of a sense of duty, respect and even affection, and we felt much better after it. There was nothing more we could have done.",
    "The issue of corruption in public life was receiving some attention during this time, in the media as well as among concerned people. We in the Food Ministry had fairly sound systems based on checks and balances. This was most necessary in our case, because we were responsible for the purchase of almost five billion rupees worth of commodities annually. We were the largest purchasing agency in the whole of Sri Lanka, until the Petroleum Corporation overtook us as a result of several oil price hikes.",
    "As mentioned earlier, there was no Cabinet Tender Board procedure. What we had was a Food Purchase Board, chaired by me as Secretary and with representation from the Department of Commerce and the External Resources Division of the Treasury on it. Purchase decisions had to be taken the same day, before markets opened the next day. There was no time to put up papers to Cabinet. The system was open and transparent.",
