ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has mopped up 546 billion rupees of domestic money, out of a total of 578.5 billion rupees created by the purchase of foreign exchange in the six months to June 2024, official data showed.

The central bank had generated 538.1 billion rupees from forex purchases from the market, a Market Operations Report showed.

The central bank had also generated 40.4 billion rupees net from buying official foreign loan proceeds after settling any loans.

Analysts had warned that one of the ways the rupee is pressured by the deeply flawed operational framework of an IMF-prone central bank is through the surrender by the Treasury of its dollar receipts, creating new money.

Government surrenders have a devastating effect on the currency, when the exchange rate is already under pressure, driving up credit and requiring an even greater contraction of the economy to end any external crisis triggered by mis-targeted short term rates, analysts have said.

### Rajapaksas  Backstabbing Ranil  Over the Presidential Candidacy Issue   Backfire  on the SLPP.

*2024-08-04 03:33:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84468) · `en`

President  Ranil Wickremesinghe was cruelly bamboozled by the Rajapaksas early this week. The incumbent president was given false promises that the Medamulana clan-led “pohottuwa”party was firmly behind him in his bid to contest the forthcoming presidential poll. The note of discord struck by Namal Rajapaksa was lightly dismissed as being of very little consequence. The message conveyed was that Wickremesinghe should formally seek the suppo rt of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) for his candidacy and that it would be accepted and approved by the SLPP as a matter of course. But when Ranil did so, the carpet was yanked from under his feet.

During my efforts to shortlist employee suggestions, ‘Establishing quality circles in all departments, to earn a national award’ was identified as a goal for 1991. Before formalizing quality circles, we initiated special clean-ups using the Sri Lankan village concept of ‘Shramadana’ (donation of time and effort). This practice brought a new sparkle to the hotel.

### The  Supreme Court has consistently upheld the principle that a govt servant is empowered to refuse to obey an ‘illegal’ order by his or her superior resulting in the use of state assets for a particular political party or candidate.

*2024-08-04 02:22:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84472) · `en`

If the glittering promise of the ‘Jathika Jana Balavegaya’ (NPP) is supposed to offer a better, brighter Sri Lanka to put an end to the ’76 year old curse’ of its political rivals, it is time that NPP Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake refrains from justifying his actions during the run-up to the September 21st Presidential elections on the basis that, ‘others are doing it, why not me?’

That absurd justification is increasingly being used by the NPP to the extent that this (logically) defeats its own argument of being ‘different’ to the others. Earlier, the NPP Presidential candidate announced on a recent visit overseas to meet his ‘supporters’ that he will declare the cost of his (frequent) travels and the sources of that (private) funding only if President Ranil Wickremesinghe together with his Minister of Sports and Minister of Labour/Foreign Employment discloses the same information regarding their (state) travels.

If anyone in this audience was skeptical regarding my earlier assertion that engineering and technology underpin numerous innovations shaping our lives, this example should effectively dispel their doubts. So what is behind this success in this new generation of AI that we now experience? It is a technology called Deep Learning, a term that may be familiar to some of you.

What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a computer learning paradigm, inspired by the human brain’s neural networks, which are believed to process data iteratively, through layers. Similar to how the brain learns from data, Deep Learning algorithms also learn by processing data, through layers of interconnected computing nodes, refining their understanding with each iteration.

“Culture is like jam; the less you have, the more you spread”

The Central Bank of Ceylon had stringent forex laws and regulations in the seventies. In 1975, it approved 18 sterling pounds for me to take to England as a student and recorded the amount in my passport. The postgraduate studentship from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) of Sussex University paid my airfare, tuition fees, and living expenses.

I travelled to Karachi from Colombo on October 1. The connecting flight to London was delayed because the plane had engine troubles. I did not have money to make a call to IDS or ARTI about the delay. The plan was for someone from IDS to meet me at Falmer railway station (the nearest to the university) on October 2 in the afternoon.

### Dramatic changes in the political landscape make strange bedfellows. We will see more such additions in the coming days.

*2024-08-04 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84476) · `en`

It has long been a common perception that none of the main candidates will be able to receive more than 50% of the popular vote in the upcoming Presidential Election.

For the last few days, since the announcement of the Presidential Election by the Election Commission, many newspapers have been publishing details of the procedures on how the next round of vote counting will be conducted to elect a president if any candidate fails to get 50%+1 of the votes in the first round.

At the same time, the moves to forge new political alliances that have started several months back have now intensified.

The two main political parties that alternated in power in the last century, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), are now shadows of their former selves. Recently a prominent political analyst humorously wrote that the UNP was the Grand Old Party, but the ‘grand’ part of it was no longer valid.

### Biden Administration achieves greatest hostage exchange since Cold War sans fanfare

Trump can’t figure out if Kamala is Black or Indian, calls her husband a “crappy Jew”

During the two weeks after President Biden’s ultimate act of patriotism in deciding not to seek re-election for a second term, the political climate in the United States has been energized with a number of totally unexpected and refreshing events.

Biden became the second man to decline re-election since Lyndon Johnson in 1968. The circumstances surrounding the decision by these presidents not to run for re-election had many differences, but forsaking personal ambition for the good of their party and country is the common theme that has distinguished their presidencies in history for their selflessness and patriotism.

### Court Orders on the Plantation Wage Issue

*2024-08-04 00:25:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/court-orders-on-the-plantation-wage-issue/) · `en`

On May Day, flanked by plantation sector legislators representing the Ceylon Worker’s Congress( CWC), President Wickremesinghe announced the increase of the plantation worker daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. His will was legitimized by a gazette notification signed by Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour. Twenty one plantation companies, collectively, filed a petition before the Court of Appeal, seeking the invalidation of the said gazette, on the basis that the unilateral and arbitrary decision by the minister violated the legal principles of natural justice.

On July 4, a three-member Supreme Court bench issued an interim injunction order, preventing the implementation of the said gazette. Clearly, the court considered that the plea by the plantation companies had merit. The latest court ruling, along with the two others delivered on the recent election-related petitions, is more egg on the president’s face.

### Less Known Facts on Kamala Harris

*2024-08-04 00:15:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/less-known-facts-on-kamala-harris/) · `en`

There’s no denying the fact that the Democratic presidential candidate and possibly the first woman president of the USA is hugely dynamic, very ambitious, a successful career woman, beautiful and feminine. Not only will Kamala Harris be the 47th President if she wins the race in November, which she can do as her ratings rises rapidly and Trump shows strain and yes, trepidation, which he tries to cover with his usual bluff and bluster. She may also be the first Black and South Asian American president; Obama being considered to be first African American Prez. A very significant fact is that powerful women are rallying around her and endorsing her strongly. They are led by Nancy Pelosi, recently 52nd Speaker of the House of Representatives. Jill Biden, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama are close behind; Hollywood stars too like Beyonce.
