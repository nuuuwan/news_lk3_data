    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to continue uninterrupted power supply islandwide while releasing maximum water levels possible from the Samanalawewa\u00a0 reservoir.",
    "Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara tweeted Monday August 07 evening that the cabinet has approved his proposal to release 3.5 million cubic metres (MCM) of water per day from the Samanalawewa reservoir from August to 10, generating maximum hydro power.",
    "From August 11 to 15t, 2.5 MCM of water will be released per day generating maximum hydro power possible.",
    "The reservoir will be shut down on August 16 for power generation preserving the dead storage of water of the dam, he said.",
    "The proposal to continue uninterrupted power supply islandwide with the closure of Samanalawewa power plant from August 16 is with a view to resolving an ongoing dispute and connect the Polpitiya-Hambantota transmission line by August 20, and to procure necessary supplementary power from available power plants by August 15.",
    "The minister tweeted earlier on Monday that Sri Lanka will see no price revision on electricity in the foreseeable future as the government has decided to revise prices biannually in January and July, Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said.",
    "\u201c[The state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)] has planned for an uninterrupted supply of power islandwide throughout the year with no scheduled power cuts. Currently, full capacity of available power plants are in use for power generation,\u201d the minister tweeted on Monday August 07.",
    "Wijesekara said a meeting had been held at the president\u2019s office yesterday with the CEB and the Irrigation Department. Options related to ensuring a continuous power supply with no scheduled power cuts and the maximum water that can be released for agriculture will be shared with the cabinet of ministers on Monday, he said.",
    "\u201cDetails related to the power generation for next 12 months, release of water for agriculture, hydro power capacity, thermal power options available will be shared and discussed,\u201d he said.",
    "Paddy farmers in the Walawe zone of Sri Lanka have been protesting for over two weeks over the authorities not issuing water for agriculture in order to release water from the Samanalawewa to the Udawalawa Reservoir. Providing an uninterrupted supply of power to the Southern Province was cited as the reason.",
    "Minister Wijesekara said discussion to settle the dispute between the land owner and the CEB to complete the ADB financed Polpitiya-Hambantota transmission line has been set for August 11 by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).",
    "\u201cThe 150-km transmission line connecting the southern province has come to stop in the last three months due to a dispute over the government valuation for a 650 meter stretch of land the lines are connected through.",
    "\u201cIf the dispute is settled the work can be completed in four days. The CEB has already paid 2,500 other individuals compensation on government valuation and completed the work in the 150 km stretch over those areas,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Aug07/2023)"
