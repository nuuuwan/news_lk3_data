### Yukthi outraged by extractive external debt restructuring agreement

*2024-12-18 05:21:21* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Yukthi-outraged-by-extractive-external-debt-restructuring-agreement/14-770659) · `en`

If the current Government is truly committed to providing social welfare and addressing the needs of the people suffering the most, it must avoid future borrowings in the capital markets

Following is a statement by Yukthi, calling for economic policies that lead to a process of sustainable development that uplifts working people. It opposes a return to high-interest international capital markets, which have already created an intolerable burden for the people

On 13 December 2024, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance announced the “successful expiration of its consent solicitation and exchange offer related to its international sovereign bonds.” The initial proposal for a deal had been concluded during a blackout period two days before the Presidential election that was held on 21 September 2024. It is a disastrous agreement that has been forced upon Sri Lanka. It will cost the country billions of dollars and it will likely lead to repeated cycles of default in the near future.

### Violating people’s sovereignty

*2024-12-18 05:16:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Violating-people-s-sovereignty/4-770658) · `en`

Unfortunately, Sri Lanka’s legislators have contrived to adversely impact on the peoples’ rights especially when it comes to the electoral process

Sri Lanka’s citizenry is in a way fortunate that there is a written down constitution – a variety of benefits behold its citizenry. Successive political legislators have however, contrived to be guilty of violating the rights of the people – when it comes to elections.

A written down constitution like Sri Lanka has, offers plenty of balance and equity for all:

A written constitution provides a clear and definite framework for government structure, powers, and limitations. It outlines the rights of citizens and the responsibilities of the government that is easily accessible and understood by all.

Our constitution includes rights that guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms for citizens. This protects individuals from potential abuses of power by the government and ensures that rights are upheld and respected.

### National security only through national harmony – a response

*2024-12-18 05:12:32* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/National-security-only-through-national-harmony-a-response/4-770657) · `en`

Who deprived the equal rights of Tamils? Not the Sinhalese but the Vellala Tamils themselves

Capt. (Rtd) Rajaratne has written the above article, appeared in Daily FT on 6 December 2024 (https://www.ft.lk/columns/National-security-only-through-national-harmony/4-770154).

Rajaratne implies that the Tamils are subjected to inequality, injustice, oppression, marginalisation, and deprivation. The commemoration of the dead LTTE cadre in the north, he says, was a stark indictment of the failures of the successive Governments to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, liberation, inclusivity, and opportunity.

The above article, in its entirety, is an attempt to convince the reader that Tamils in Sri Lanka are discriminated against and their grievances are not addressed properly. The above implication, which is far from truth, is exactly what the separatists want the world to know to justify their claim for a federal/independent state.

Chief Government Whip and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday revealed to the House that 34 former Prime Ministers, Ministers, MPs and Advisers have disproportionately benefitted from the President’s Fund, receiving financial assistance for medical treatment that goes beyond the fund’s original purpose of support the poor and underprivileged.

Detailing the payments allocated to MPs from the President’s Fund between 2005 and 2024, he questioned the purposes for which such large amounts had been drawn by politicians.

Former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella received Rs. 11 million, while Rajitha Senaratne was granted Rs. 10 million. Former Minister Alek Aluvihare received Rs. 2.2 million, and his son Ranjith Aluvihare, a former MP, received Rs. 4.6 million. The fund also released Rs. 30 million to former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne.

The Court of Appeal has ordered that a petition challenging the Parliamentary seat of Jaffna District Independent Group MP Ramanathan Archchuna be considered on 15 January. The petition seeks a writ of certiorari to nullify his position as a Member of Parliament.

The petition by Abhinava Niwahal Peramuna Chairperson Oshala Herath was taken up today before a bench comprising Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and Mahen Gopallawa yesterday. After initial deliberations, the court scheduled the petition for 15 January to examine the facts in detail.

The petitioner contends that MP Ramanathan Archchuna submitted his nomination papers during the last General Election while still serving as a doctor employed in the State sector. Herath argues that this act is illegal as it violates the Elections Act, which prohibits individuals holding Government office from contesting elections without first resigning.

### We make a decision to insult religious traditions

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



PM Harini Amarasuriya criticizes cremation policy as unjust to religions & families. She vows to prevent similar decisions affecting religious traditions.

🟩

Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya told Parliament yesterday (17) that the injustice inflicted on religious traditions and mothers could never be justified by cremation of the victims of the infection.

The resolution of the last government is not in any way justified. It is a resolution of the most sensitive and most cruel. The family is able to express their grief and reduce grief through the customs that are fulfilled after a death. That is why it has been given religious values.

Such traditions are very important in the uncertainty like the Kovit infection. In this case, such a terrible decision cannot be allowed in any way. Politics or any other reason for that is not valid. It is unreasonable to make such a decision without scientific basis. Therefore, our government will never make any resolution that will cause such suffering to any sect or to insult religious traditions.

We must have the best relationship with our recent country India. It is a country that can always cooperate with us.

However, the National People's Power has said that it will not have any contact with India regarding the petroleum pipe.. Similarly, it was reported that the power was not connected.

But now we know that the government has agreed to these two issues. Our position is to take place. We do not say that the consensus of the Monetary Fund is like that. Instead, I should make amendments to it and go ahead.
