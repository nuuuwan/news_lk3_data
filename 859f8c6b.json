    "French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne resigned Monday following recent political turmoil over immigration, paving the way for President Emmanuel Macron to seek fresh momentum by appointing a new government in the coming days.",
    "The shakeup was widely seen as an attempt by the 46-year-old centrist Macron to head off a looming lame-duck status. Macron\u2019s term is to end in 2027, and he won\u2019t be able to run for president for a consecutive third term in line with the French Constitution.",
    "In her resignation letter, Borne suggested she resigned at Macron\u2019s request, citing the president\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d to \u201cappoint a new prime minister.\u201d",
    "Borne\u2019s resignation followed the passage late last month of contentious immigration legislation backed by Macron aimed at strengthening the government\u2019s ability to deport some foreigners, among other measures.",
    "Macron\u2019s centrist alliance was able to pass the measure only after making a deal with the conservative Republicans party, which many observers saw as the government\u2019s shift to the right. The tough negotiations and heated parliament debate raised questions over the ability of Borne\u2019s government to pass future major bills.",
    "Political observers also suggested that Macron, a staunch supporter of European integration, wants his new government to get ready for June\u2019s European Union elections.",
    "Borne, 62, had been appointed in May 2022 after Macron\u2019s reelection for a second term. She was France\u2019s second female prime minister.",
    "The following month, Macron\u2019s centrists lost their majority in parliament, forcing the government into political maneuvering and using special constitutional powers to be able to pass laws.",
    "Last year, Borne faced mass protests often marred by violence against unpopular pension changes. The bill to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64 was enacted into law in April, angering many people across the country.",
    "She also faced days of riots which erupted across France at the beginning of the summer, triggered by the deadly police shooting of a teen.",
    "Macron\u2019s office announced his acceptance of Borne\u2019s resignation in a statement, and the president posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Borne\u2019s work \u201chas been exemplary every day.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou have implemented our project with statewomen\u2019s courage, commitment and determination. Thank you from the bottom of my heart,\u201d he wrote.",
    "The statement from Macron\u2019s office said Borne will continue in her duties until a new government is appointed.",
    "French media outlets reported Monday evening that Education Minister Gabriel Attal, 34, was the favorite for the job. If named, he would be the youngest prime minister in France\u2019s modern history.",
    "Other names often mentioned include Minister for the Armed Forces S\u00e9bastien Lecornu and former Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie, a longtime supporter of Macron who helped him launch his political movement.",
    "Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president and accountable to the parliament. The prime minister is in charge of implementing domestic policy and coordinating the government\u2019s team of ministers.",
    "The president holds substantial powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense. He is also the commander-in-chief of the country\u2019s armed forces."
