O. Pannirselvam, a former Chief Minister, is contesting independently in the Ramanathapuram Lok Sabha constituency under the BJP coalition.

The presence of these "dummy" candidates does not seem to affect his position significantly.

Pannirselvam said that even if the interruptions come, we will win.

In this case, as of 12:30 pm today (June 4), former Chief Minister O. Pannirselvam is in 2nd place with 53,167 votes (41,260 votes).. Ochappan's son Pannir Selvam received 573 votes, Pannirselvam, son of Malayandi, 433 votes, Pannirselvam, son of Oyadevar, 314 votes and Pannirselvam, son of Ochadevar.

### Imran Khan acquitted in state secrets case

*2024-06-04 14:21:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99655/imran-khan-acquitted-in-state-secrets-case) · `en`

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case.

In the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated.

Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022.

The Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now.

The former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce.

The couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister.

Even behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics.

### India election results 2024: Modi’s BJP may fall short of majority

One of the BJP’s strongest hopes, K Annamalai, is trailing in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore seat by more than 23,000 votes.

The party had high hopes that the former police officer would help them gain in a state that has traditionally rejected it.

PM Narendra Modi has a comfortable lead of over 98,000 votes in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi seat, where he is the incumbent MP.

Prominent regional Samajwadi Party and the Congress have fielded Ajay Rai as their joint candidate.

Mr Modi won with a vote share of more than 63% here in 2019.

Despite the lower-than-expected numbers for the BJP, the party is still confident of forming the next government — and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has ruled for the past decade, and under whom the party fought this campaign.

04.03 PM - The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has crossed the halfway mark in the Lok Sabha elections, but the lead is narrower than what exit polls had predicted.

The narrow margin prompted talks that the Opposition may reach out to some of the BJP's allies, a charge Nationalist Congress Party patriarch Sharad Pawar denied.

During a press conference, Mr Pawar denied reports that he has reached out to Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) head Chandrababu Naidu.

Home Minister Amit Shah is leading in the Gandhinagar constituency in Gujarat with a huge margin of over 6.15 lakh votes.

12.05 PM - Veteran actor Raj Babbar is leading in Gurgaon seat on Congress ticket by over 30,000 seats

11.58 AM -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls. Opposition gains are higher than expected.

11.48 AM - When Narendra Modi launched his campaign with the slogan “Ab ki baar, 400 paar,” he aimed for more than 400 seats for his BJP-led NDA alliance. The most optimistic exit polls even predicted a clear 400 seats for them.

However, early trends indicate a much tighter contest with the Congress-led INDIA alliance, a centre-left coalition. Speculation is already rife about whether the BJP alone will reach the 272 seats needed for a majority in the 543-seat parliament.

The lead between the two coalitions appears narrower than expected, with early trends showing a difference of only 60 to 70 seats.

### Sri Lanka faces barriers in reclaiming priceless artifacts from Britain

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is facing legal barriers in its efforts to reclaim priceless artifacts from Britain, as many of these items are held by private individuals rather than the state, Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickremenayake said.

Sri Lanka has been actively requesting the return of invaluable artifacts taken during colonial rule prior to the country’s independence in 1948.

Last year, the Netherlands returned six Kandyan artifacts, including gold and silver ceremonial swords, two wall guns, and Lewke Disave’s cannon, after a formal request.

“We have made similar requests to the British government. However, the challenge is that many of these artifacts are in the possession of individuals, not the state,” Wickremenayake told EconomyNext.

“We cannot ask private British citizens to return these items in the same way we request from the British government. We have a substantial list of artifacts taken during the British period.”

India, June 4 ( Al Jazeera) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance is leading as India counts votes after a mammoth seven-phase election – the world’s largest democratic exercise – that began on April 19 and ended on Saturday.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats to cross the majority mark in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament.

Exit polls show Modi is well on track to return to power for a third consecutive term, while the Indian National Congress party-led opposition bloc hopes to upstage him.

The Election Commission says a record-breaking 642 million voters cast their ballots in the staggered election as it dismissed opposition concerns over how the votes would be counted.

However, the voter turnout this year was 66.3 percent, about one percentage point lower than 2019.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is exploring the inclusion of pharmaceuticals and machinery in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Pakistan, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Pakistan, Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne said.

Experts view the move as a potential step for Sri Lanka to reduce the prices of the both goods.

Both South Asian nations began implementing the FTA in 2005, allowing each side to export up to $1 billion worth of goods to the other.

“The trade volume should be increased,” Wijegunaratne told EconomyNext from Islamabad.

“During the last 20 years, Pakistan has improved tremendously, specially in the pharmaceutical and machinery sectors. We have to include these through negotiations,” he said when asked if Sri Lanka considers expanding the FTA list with Pakistan.

The aims of the FTA were to strengthen economic relations between the two nations, increase trade in goods and services, and reduce or eliminate tariffs on a wide range of products.

### India begins counting votes in marathon election expected to bring Prime Minister Modi a third term

*2024-06-04 10:25:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99648/india-begins-counting-votes-in-marathon-election-expected-to-bring-prime-minister-modi-a-third-term) · `en`

India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the world’s largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power.

The six-week election was seen as a referendum on Modi. If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister.

Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.

Indian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.

Several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern and North-western provinces.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places elsewhere of the island in the evening or night, it said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
