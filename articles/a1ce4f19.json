    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has approved 62,314 state sector jobs in the last eight months under the new government, Cabinet Spokesman and Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.",
    "\u201cIn the last eight months, 62,314 cadre positions have been approved to be recruited to state services,\u201d he told reporters at the weekly Cabinet media briefing in Colombo on Tuesday.",
    "\u201cSome have already been recruited. For some the exams are being held and for some others, the interviews are going on.\u201d",
    "The new government\u2019s recruitment drive comes against the last government\u2019s move to shrink state sector jobs to reduce the budget deficit.",
    "However, Minister Jayatissa justified the move saying that the approval came due to vacancies existing in several ministries.",
    "He said approval had been given for the Defence Ministry to fill 12,433 cadre positions while 11,888 state jobs including government medical officers were approved for Media and Health Ministries. (Colombo/August 12/2025)"
