He said this while addressing the debate on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill held in Parliament on Wednesday (24).

16 judges have been promoted to the Supreme Court.. 3 members should be appointed by the Court Commission to conduct an interview.

### Zakath and poverty: Why the powerful tool falls short in Sri Lanka

Zakath is designed not merely to relieve poverty temporarily but to eradicate it by creating economic balance and social solidarity

Modern business enterprises are scientific, complex, and competitive. No project can succeed without rigorous planning — including feasibility studies, project appraisals, business models, and risk management strategies. Although zakath administrators and volunteers dedicate themselves selflessly, most lack the technical expertise required for such tasks. Many are unfamiliar with the importance of professional assessments, while others are hesitant to allocate funds for preliminary studies, considering them “wasteful.” This approach, however, contradicts both reason and revelation

The key thing about the first year of the AKD presidency is that its true character and core content were revealed through action and inaction; roads taken and not taken; choices made and options rejected. The AKD presidency revealed its reality in its first year. It showed its soul.

President AKD spoke at length about economics at the ceremony to kick-off construction of the Kadawatha-Mirigama segment of the Central Expressway project. This passage is key:

“…Even by today, the IMF, World Bank and rating agencies have given extremely important signals about our economy. I saw a report in which the World Bank has given us the recognition that in rebuilding broken-down states, the fastest speed has been registered by Sri Lanka. This is an extremely important factor. Therefore, we are proceeding on our journey with great steadiness and stability…”

TV news showed JVP chief theoretician Bimal Rathnayake leading the cheers as Anura paused, having enunciated this wisdom.

The shipping industry is experiencing major volatility amid rising geopolitical tensions and disruptions caused by a wave of new tariffs, according to a report published on Wednesday by the U.N. Trade and Development agency.

Due to an increasingly complex and uncertain global trade environment, subdued industrial activity in major economies and weak Chinese demand for bulk commodities, UNCTAD has revised down its maritime trade growth forecast for 2025.

It now projects overall maritime trade volume to expand 0.5 per cent annually, with containerized trade growing slightly faster at 1.4 per cent.

The report highlights that trade policy shifts, including new tariffs, are disrupting global supply chains.

Maritime navigation in the Black Sea has been complicated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Conflict in the Middle East drove up shipping costs as vessels were rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope following disruption to the Red Sea, UNCTAD said.
