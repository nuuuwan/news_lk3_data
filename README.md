Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe’s largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.

The fire comes less than a week after Ukraine’s forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war-start in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscow’s battlefield gains.

### Sri Lanka to pay Rs6,000 to state pensioners in October after EC opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state pensioners will be paid 6,000 rupees in October after an increase of 3,000 rupees from September was shot down by the Elections Commissions, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The cabinet decided to pay the 3,000 rupee allowance to 700,000 pensioners effective September.

But the elections commission opposed it as an election was declared, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

As a result, a 6,000 rupee payment would be made with arrears in October. From November 3,000 rupees would be added to the pension, he said.

Earlier this year a 2,500 rupee allowance was given to pensioners.

Unlike unemployed graduates who are hired without actual vacancies, many of Sri Lanka’s current pensioners were in government service working for small salaries.

In the 1980s and early 1990s when the central bank and macro-economists busted the currency incessantly without a credible anchor for money, they got very low real wages.

### IMF classifies Sri Lanka’s exchange regime as ‘other managed’ arrangement

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s exchange rate arrangement involving ad hoc interventions, which has so far remained stable and provided a strong foundation for economic activities to resume amid broadly deflationary monetary policy, has been classified as ‘other managed’ by the International Monetary Fund.

Especially after 1978 as the IMF’s Second Amendment to its Articles deprived members of a credible anchor for money, countries ended up with various exchange rates arrangements, which collapse due to conflicting money and exchange policies, triggering high inflation, social unrest and political upheavals.

“The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating, while the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed,” the IMF said in its last economic report.

### The two Chief  similarities between Sri Lanka’s 2022 ‘youth aragalaya’ and Bangladesh’s youth uprising in 2024

*2024-08-12 03:30:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84516) · `en`

Those who unwisely murmur ‘Bangladeshi people power a la Sri Lanka’ in assessing the ‘second liberation’ of Bangladesh following the jubilant toppling of fifteen year one-party rule by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by thousands of youth earlier this month, must restrain their enthusiasm in no small part.

The 2022 youth protests in Sri Lanka precipitating the flight of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the collapse of his Government has led to significantly different outcomes in this country as compared to evolving – and still volatile – developments in Bangladesh.

In essence, there are only two similarities. First, both Hasina and Rajapaksa, consumed by their monstrous political egos, refused to believe that the ‘hordes’ were literally at the door of their respective ‘palaces’ until the eleventh hour.

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday reassured the public that the Finance Ministry can support Presidential polls with any number of candidates.

Siyambalapitiya noted that the expenditure estimate for the Presidential polls has not yet surpassed the Rs. 10 billion limit set for the event.

She highlights Ranil's selfless dedication to the nation over his political future. Despite challenges, including the unfeasibility of building a united front, she advocates for Ranil's victory as crucial for the country's recovery.

🟩

No one can build the Sri Lanka PA. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the upcoming election.

While the country was opposed to the worst economic crisis, none of the heroes who are currently speaking of the government have been responsible for the government. The country was on fire. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the country without considering his political future.

The ruling and opposition parties must remember that no one can do election campaigns if the Age of 20122 is present in the year 20122.

I will be happy if the PA wins, but it is impossible to practice. No one can build public Peramuna. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the election. If he wins, the country will win.

The firm structure for recovering from the economic crisis has now been implemented.

In innovation outputs, there are two categories, namely, knowledge and technology and creativity. In all these categories, Sri Lanka’s performance as an innovative economy has been far from the desired.

There is a long list of Presidential hopefuls, but the voters will focus on five or six of them. From among them, one will be elected as the leader to steer the country to progress and prosperity. However, if they are to deliver prosperity to people, they should adopt policy strategies to accelerate economic growth at an unparalleled level of 8-9% annually over the next 25 years. This requires Sri Lanka to generate new inventions which should be commercially produced for the local as well as for global markets through innovations.

Hence, inventions and innovations should receive the highest priority of those aspiring to win the forthcoming Presidential election in their policy strategies. This article series will provide the needed guidance to those Presidential hopefuls. It is an updated and a modified version of a previous paper written by the author for the Association of Professional Bankers.

Modern economies should be aptly termed innovation or creative economies
