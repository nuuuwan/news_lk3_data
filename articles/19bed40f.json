    "Kuala Lumpur Immigration director Wan Mohammed Saupee Wan Yusoff said in the 10.15 am incident, a Sri Lankan man came with a local woman claiming to be his mother to apply for a first-time child passport under the 10-year-old category, Bernama reports.",
    "\u201cSuspicion arose when immigration officers noticed the man\u2019s physical appearance was far older than the age stated on the submitted birth certificate.",
    "\u201cHe was also unable to follow simple instructions in basic Malay, including when asked to undergo biometric verification,\u201d he said in a statement today.",
    "Wan Mohammed Saupee said further investigations revealed that the local woman acted under the syndicate\u2019s instructions, which offered a \u2018shortcut\u2019 for Sri Lankans to obtain Malaysian passports.",
    "He said the syndicate\u2019s modus operandi involved using the birth certificate of the local woman\u2019s biological child to enable the Sri Lankan national to apply for a Malaysian passport by posing as her son.",
