    "The practice of medicine is regarded as an honourable enterprise due to its emphasis on serving humanity and promoting public health. In addition to being equipped with a combination of clinical expertise, technical skill [where applicable], and interpersonal skill, the medical practitioner is expected to act with moral integrity. The moral and ethical principles, common to all mankind, expounded in ancient Greek philosophical thought, was first integrated with medical practice by Hippocrates [5th Century BCE] in an attempt at enhancing professional standards. With the passage of time, medical ethics were formulated into codes and oaths [e. g. Hippocratic Oath], and in 1803, the English Physician, Thomas Percival, founded the modern ethical principles in medical practice.",
    "Beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy and justice have gained acceptance as the four ethical principles of medical practice \u2013 the first two advocated by Hippocrates \u2013\u201dto help and do no harm\u201d \u2013 and the latter two developed with the passage of time.",
    "The following overview of ethical principles in medical practice was written in view of recent media reports of alleged transgressions in ethical conduct by some medical practitioners. It was written with the intention of raising awareness of the general reader and the student of medicine:",
    "In the medical context, the term beneficence [Latin: facere: \u2018to do\u2019, bene: good] refers to the obligation of medical practitioners to act in a manner beneficial to their patients and promote their welfare: \u2018to provide competent and trustworthy service\u2019; and \u2018to act with empathy and kindness\u2019. The term also applies to the role played by healthcare facilities \u2013 state and private.",
    "In contrast to beneficence, which is a \u2018positive requirement\u2019, nonmaleficence refers to \u2018first do no harm\u2019 [Latin: male: \u2018harm\u2019, \u2018evil\u2019]. From a medical perspective, it refers to the need to refrain from \u2018unnecessary and unjustified\u2019 therapeutic interventions.",
    "According to the moral theory of German philosopher Immanuel Kant [1724-1804], autonomy [self-determination] stood for the ideal of \u2018free will driven to action by rational thought, and not determined by an inner desire or by an external force [coercion]\u2019. In its application to clinical practice, the medical practitioner is obliged to disclose all relevant medical findings and treatment options in order for the patient to have a role in decision-making, and exercise his/her right to self-determination. It requires the application of codes of practice such as informed consent, truth-telling and confidentiality, which are based on the right of self-determination; but not without challenges.",
    "Elements of [or preconditions for] valid consent for a medical or surgical procedure are, the patient 1. must be competent to understand and decide, 2. receives full disclosure, 3. Comprehends the disclosure, 4. acts voluntarily, and 5. consents to the proposed action.",
    "Some question the universal applicability of the above requirements as they are developed in western culture. In defence it is argued that they are based on core human values.",
    "Competence is the key requirement in obtaining valid consent, but is often relative. Competence usually becomes an issue when a recommended treatment is refused. Law tends to presume competence except in those suffering from \u2018major\u2019 mental illness and in minors. Standards generally adopted for determining incompetence are based on the patient\u2019s, 1. inability to state a preference or choice, 2. inability to understand one\u2019s situation and its consequences, 3. inability to reason through a consequential life decision.",
    "In the case of a presently incompetent but previously competent patient, the following approaches are adopted in decision making: 1. taking into account the patient\u2019s previously expressed preferences, or 2. involvement of a surrogate decision-maker [or guardian] who either exercises a substituted judgement in accord with the patient\u2019s authentic values or makes a \u2018best interests\u2019 judgement.",
    "An autonomous patient has the right to request full disclosure of his or her medical condition and prognosis. It is an essential component of the therapeutic relationship based on trust.",
    "The medical practitioner is obliged to provide such medical information, with thoughtfulness and sensitivity, however grave the condition is. Nevertheless, in some cultures, the medical practitioner is expected to disclose information regarding serious illness to the immediate family and not to the patient, in case it may cause distress and loss of hope in the patient. The unfortunate consequences of not revealing a life-threatening diagnosis, such as incurable cancer, to the patient is that he or she may lose the opportunity of attending to financial matters [eg. division of assets], taking leave of loved-ones, or engaging in spiritual activity.",
    "The medical practitioner is obliged to maintain confidentiality by not disclosing medical information to another party without the authorisation of the patient. But such authorisation is implied when a medical practitioner works in liaison with another health professional where sharing of information is paramount. Also, in exceptional circumstances where the patient\u2019s illness may place others at risk [eg. in epidemics of infectious disease; major psychiatric illness [in situations where the patient poses a danger to self or others], or if the information is legally requested, the principle of patient confidentiality may be overridden.",
    "Based on the principle of fairness, justice, in relation to healthcare refers to the equitable distribution of medical resources, e. g. hospital facilities, medical personnel, laboratory tests, medications, etc., known as \u2018distributive justice\u2019. When healthcare operates with limited resources, distribution of resources may have to be made according to need.",
    "The modern-day medical practitioner is expected to be guided by the above ethical principles rooted in common morality, and hence universally applicable. But not uncommonly, the practitioner is faced with having to determine the best course of action when ethical principles collide \u2013 commonly between beneficence and autonomy.",
    "Albert R Jonsen, a pioneer in bioethics, proposed a practical approach to resolving ethical conflicts in clinical practice. His model involves balancing considerations of competing issues [\u2018kinetics of the case\u2019], in order to choose the preferred course. He proposes the following core issues [which constitute the \u2018morphology of the case\u2019] in organising the clinician\u2019s thinking in decision-making:",
    "* Medical indications: A formulation of the case with proposed treatment options and goals of care, including potential risks and benefits of treatment.",
    "* Patient preference: A guiding principle in autonomous patients. In non-autonomous patients, taking into account their prior preferences [if known] / advance directive / surrogate decision.",
    "* Quality of life: Refers to the expected outcome [both positive and negative] of clinical intervention in terms of physical and psychological well-being experienced by the patient, eg. experience of pain, degree of mobility, social interaction, mental acuity etc. This Concept becomes particularly relevant in end-of-life cases and termination of life support.",
    "* Contextual features: These are factors external to the doctor-patient relationship and the clinical assessment of the case but may have an impact on patient care. They include family, religious, financial and legal matters etc. that may conflict with the ethical task.",
    "The above is an overview of ethical principles founded on morality, integrated into clinical practice. A recognised model of case analysis in resolving potential conflicts between ethical principles is presented. It must be stressed that an essential footing in upholding ethical conduct in medicine is empathic communication, which involves active listening and exercising a deep level of understanding and care by the medical practitioner. Good record keeping by the medical practitioner will always stand in good stead, not only for the patient but also for the practitioner.",
