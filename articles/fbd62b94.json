    "Sri Lanka does not manufacture products which contain POPs or mercury. However, many products containing these substances are imported to the country for various uses every year. Though stringent regulations have been introduced, a lack of capacity in the application of these regulations result in the continued mismanagement of chemical imports to the country.",
