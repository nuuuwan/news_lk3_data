### EXPLAINER: Possible policy implications on Sri LankaтАЩs energy sector after parliament polls

*2024-11-13 17:45:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/explainer-possible-policy-implications-on-sri-lankas-energy-sector-after-parliament-polls-187350/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs energy sector is expected to undergo significant changes, guided by social and economic reforms under the island nationтАЩs new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) government. Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The NPPтАЩs policy platform strongly emphasizes environmental sustainability and energy independence. The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPPтАЩs policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. тАЛ

### The country will reach the bankruptcy if the debt is not re -planned - Ranil

*2024-11-13 17:41:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198617) ┬╖ `ta`

Sri Lanka faces bankruptcy risk if debt restructuring isn't planned properly by 2028, warns former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Economic collapse in 2022 led to bankruptcy declaration. International Monetary Fund loan discussions ongoing to stabilize economy and repay debt. Key challenges include reducing debt burden and meeting 15% state income target by 2028 through new tax strategies without overburdening citizens.

### EXPLAINER: Possible policy impacts on Sri LankaтАЩs investments after parliament polls

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Both local and foreign investments in Sri Lanka are likely to face shifts that reflect new priorities in economic and social reforms under President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) government after the November 14 parliament polls. Here are five likely key impacts on investments:

The NPP is expected to introduce stricter regulations for sectors deemed strategic or essential, which could increase the complexity of doing business for both local and foreign investors, analysts say. Such moves are likely to help in curbing deep rooted corruption at the expense of some delays, they say. This could affect investment in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and utilities, where state influence may increase to ensure alignment with public needs and national prioritiesтАЛ.

Here are five potential impacts on the banking sector after the parliament polls, in which NPP is believed to have an edge:

The NPP has historically advocated for stronger state control over strategic economic sectors, including banking. Under Dissanayake, the sector may face increased regulation and scrutiny aimed at reducing perceived corruption, addressing financial mismanagement, and protecting consumer interests. This could lead to a more restrictive operational environment for banks, with potential impacts on profitability and compliance costs. тАЛ

*2024-11-13 13:45:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-sees-less-election-complaints-than-in-previous-years-187148/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs Election Commission had received 188 complaints on Monday (11) when campaigning officially ceased ahead of the Parliamentary Election on November 14.

A majority of the complaints were on election law violations, with only one incident reported of actual violence.

Total complaints received by the commission since the election was declared on September 26 was 2,999.

The number of incidents are considerably less compared to the 8,683 reported in the previous parliamentary election in┬а August 2022.

Historically, Sri Lanka has seen violent incidents sometimes leading to deaths, in the run-up to general elections as not just candidates from opposing parties, but also inter-party contenders vie for preference votes (manapa pora). (Colombo/Nov13/2024)

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs President Anura Dissanayake faces a range of key political risks and challenges, particularly given his position as the leader of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP), a historically leftist alliance.

The NPP is tipped to win the November 14 parliamentary polls, but it is uncertain what number of seats it will gain in the 225-member legislature.

DissanayakeтАЩs JVP has been involved in two insurrections in the past, while his broader NPP coalition is accused by rivals of having no experience in handling critical issues as a ruling party in the government.

Here is a detailed overview of the major political risks and policy dilemmas for DissanayakeтАЩs government after forming an extended NPP government beyond the current three-member cabinet:

Several international airlines cancelled flights to and from IndonesiaтАЩs resort island of Bali on Wednesday, after further eruptions of a volcano that has spewed ash clouds as high as 10 km (32,808 ft) and forced thousands to evacuate.

From Nov. 4 to Nov. 12, 80 flights in Bali were cancelled, including from Singapore, Hong Kong, and several Australian cities, said Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, general manager of BaliтАЩs Ngurah Rai airport.

"Parents dispute suicide claim for son. Cite his helpful nature & love for life. Seek justice rather than accepting death as self-inflicted."

ЁЯЯй

The death of two students of an international school in Colombo's luxury series has caused great controversy and many questions.

Although many claimed suicide, the parents of one of the students who died, Joro Singh's parents, have rejected it and have reported that there have been many misunderstandings.

They have shared their memories of Givon and have reported the events that caused him to die.

The attitude of Jivon, who helped others, was the cause of his death on July 2 at luxury.

Jivon tried to help someone who was in need of his help that day. It was his natural attitude.

However, due to his dedication to help others, we have decided to respond to the false information about his death.

Givon did not commit suicide, and his immense love for life and the attitude of thinking favorably were his characteristics, and we are trying to protect his memories and ensure that his character is understood.

Chandrarathna BandaraтАЩs most recent novel Piy─Бsara Samaya,of which the title might be loosely translated as A Time for Flying (or even a Time to Flee), is a thought-provoking novel which offers the reader a space to connect their lived experience with the narrative. It deals with the socio-political realities which were our lived experience as Sri Lankans in the recent past. The novelistтАЩs previous work Prem─Бnishansa received the Swarnapusthaka award and the Vidyodaya award for best novel in 2022. Piy─Бsara Samaya which came out this September has themes which are in common with Prem─Бnishansa and the novel is set in such a way that the narrative deals with recent happenings in Sri Lanka. However, what is most noteworthy is its contribution to the literary genre of diasporic writing or novels of expatriation.

The novelist introduces two protagonists and through their characters offers many insights to certain aspects of life.

### Class conflict shattered, politics returned to people

I have always been struck by two distinct moments in history. First, in June 1865, during the tenure of President Abraham Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the United States of America. And yet, there were slaves who were reluctant to embrace the associated freedoms. They appeared to be too attached to their chains.

Then, in July 1945 C.W.W. Kannangara introduced an act in parliament to ensure free education for all Sri Lankans. He was compelled to debate for hours extolling the virtues of this move. There were many who attempted to throw sand in his wheels. Among the elites there were even those who argued that if this piece of legislation was passed, they wouldnтАЩt be able to find a boy to pluck coconuts on their extensive properties.

This is especially important given the irresponsible behaviour we have seen in Parliament in recent years. Both the incoming Government and the Opposition will have a huge responsibility. Their first task should be to strengthen democracy by helping the country recover from the financial crisis we are facing.
