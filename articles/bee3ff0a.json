    "US, Feb 13- The US Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine and Israel in a vote early Tuesday morning, setting up a showdown with the House as Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized the legislation.",
    "The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities. It\u2019s unclear whether Johnson would hold a vote on it and many House Republicans are opposed to further aid to Ukraine.",
    "The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson\u2019s criticism of the legislation and former President Donald Trump signaling opposition to the bill by arguing the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is in the form of a loan. The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republicans voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
    "\u201cHistory settles every account,\u201d McConnell said in a statement following the vote. \u201cAnd today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.\u201d",
    "The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region in addition to other policy provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the news in a statement Tuesday, thanking Schumer, McConnell and \u201cevery US Senator who has supported continued assistance to Ukraine as we fight for freedom, democracy, and the values we all hold dear.\u201d",
    "\u201cFor us in Ukraine, continued US assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war,\u201d Zelensky said on X. \u201cAmerican assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world.\u201d"
