    "Former Minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, who is in remand custody on charges under the Public Property Act, yesterday filed a bail application before the Colombo High Court after being denied bail at the Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "High Court Judge Lanka Jayaratne fixed the matter for 2 October to consider submissions on the request. Rajapaksa was taken into custody by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) on 6 August over allegations that compensation amounting to Rs. 8.85 million was secured by pressuring officials of the Damage Assessment Office. The payment is related to the property of the Mahaweli Authority at Sevanagala that was destroyed during the recent public protests.",
    "The Colombo Chief Magistrate initially ordered his remand, and a bail application before the Magistrate\u2019s Court was rejected on 12 August. Rajapaksa has now sought revision before the High Court, asking that the Magistrate\u2019s order be set aside and that he be granted bail."
