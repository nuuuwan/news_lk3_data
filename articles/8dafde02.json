    "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is exploring proposals to abolish some visa fees for top global talent at a time when the United States has taken a tougher stance on immigration, the Reuters News Agency on Monday (Sep 22).",
    "Starmer\u2019s \u201cglobal talent task force\u201d is working on ideas to attract the world\u2019s best scientists, academics and digital experts to the UK in a bid to drive economic growth, the report said, citing people briefed on the discussions inside Number 10 and the Treasury.",
    "The idea of cutting visa costs to zero is for people who have attended the world\u2019s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes, an official told the newspaper.",
    "According to the report, the reforms were being discussed in Number 10 and the Treasury before the Trump administration announced its decision to impose a US$100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, which are widely used by US tech companies, from Sunday.",
    "The US decision, however, has put \u201cwind in the sails\u201d to those pushing for changes to Britain\u2019s high-end visa system, aiming to spur growth ahead of the Nov 26 Budget, a person involved in the UK discussions has said.",
    "Britain\u2019s global talent visa application costs 766 pounds (US$1,030), with partners and children paying the same fee."
