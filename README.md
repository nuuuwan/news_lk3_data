The motion was scrapped without ballot counting because the number of votes didn’t reach 200.

However, former Labor Minister has personally signed a contract with a state of Korea. Its copy is not in the Bureau of Foreign Employment.

But the deal is private agencies.. But as a responsible minister, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been submitted to the Cabinet, obtaining permission from the Foreign Ministry and signed a Memorandum of Understanding?. Nothing happened.

### All at sea?

*2024-12-07 00:16:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/All-at-sea/4-770205) · `en`

But if the Chabad House movement’s ideology – politics, if you will – is the core issue here, why so in one place, but apparently not in another?

Mental gymnastics – something Gunasekara suggests I am guilty of indulging in – are hardly needed to appreciate the wider context here. A fair bit of media commentary on these events includes a final note to the effect that three-quarters of all Dutch Jews – many of my own relatives included – were murdered by the Nazis, mostly in concentration camps but all too many, like those Israeli and Jewish football supporters, hunted down on the streets of Amsterdam and a host of other Dutch towns and villages. It’s this history that underlies Dutch politicians’ responses to the recent violence

### Sri Lanka’s energy independence through climate finance

Sri Lanka can significantly advance its climate change ambition and negotiate from a point of strength for increased flow of concessional climate finance to realise its ambitious strategy for energy transition to achieve energy sovereignty

Now it is technically possible to operate power grids comprising of close to 100% renewable energy sources such as hydro power including pump storage hydro, solar and wind and battery energy storage. The Sri Lanka Electricity Act of 2024 provides the legal framework for this. For a country like Sri Lanka, which is entirely dependent on imported fossil fuel such as oil, coal and LNG (in the future), this provides an opportunity to achieve complete energy sovereignty by eliminating the need for fossil fuel imports. This would provide reliable, indigenous electricity which is not exposed to fluctuations in global fuel prices and exchange rate

*2024-12-06 23:56:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Blueprint-for-new-Constitution/4-770198) · `en`

The Constitution, which is the supreme and fundamental law, must be sufficiently flexible to enable different shades of political opinion to be developed and implemented from time to time

When the citizens agree to be governed, what they insist in return from the rulers is that their rights and freedoms be effectively guaranteed. The Constitution should provide, as it does in many other countries, that an international human rights treaty, when ratified, will have the force of law, superseding any inconsistent existing law. If the Government is unwilling to do so, why ratify a treaty at all? Alternatively, at least the provisions of the two international human rights covenants should be incorporated in the Constitution. That is not only a matter of sound commonsense and prudent governance; it is also a solemn treaty obligation
