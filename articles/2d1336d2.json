    "The stamp and FDC issued in 1988 to celebrate centenary of Maliyadeva College",
    "In order to celebrate the 135th anniversary of Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala, a special commemorative cover (philately cover) would be issued today at the school premises. This special cover has a uniqueness to it. It would be the first of its kind to be released inside a very special book. Not only would this be of utmost value and importance to philatelists, but the book would also comprise the first day cover (FDC) issued in 1988 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the College (in limited quantity) and the recently released cover to celebrate 100 years of scouting at the College.",
    "The celebrations would also include a stamp exhibition \u201cSandesha Mudra\u201d and stalls for visitors to buy old/new philatelic material. The exhibition is open from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. from 15 to 17 March. A number of stamp sellers would be present at the event including the Philatelic Bureau. It would be an ideal opportunity for students and adults alike to get the latest stamp items at the original price and also get vintage stamps at reasonable prices.",
