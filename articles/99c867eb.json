    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is in discussion with religious leaders who have requested him to be the common candidate in the upcoming presidential elections expected to be held between September 18 and October 18, the legal expert said.",
    "Rajapakshe, 65, has been in the parliament for two decades since 2004 and had held various positions including cabinet portfolio. He gained overnight popularity after exposing corruptions at state-run enterprises as the Chairman of parliament Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).",
    "In his response to media over possibility of becoming a common candidate, he said he is still discussing with religious leaders on that.",
    "\u201cAll religious leaders including all Nikayas of Buddhist clergies, Hindu, Christianity and Islam have requested me,\u201d to consider becoming a presidential candidate, he told reporters on Friday (29)\u00a0 after visiting Kandy Asgiriya temple.",
    "\u201cI am discussing with those groups. I am ready to take any challenges on behalf of the country. I have not taken any decision on that. I will take a correct decision after discussing with all those parties.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is yet to declare the date for presidential poll, but many political leaders and business moguls have already declared themselves as the presidential candidates while many leaders have expressed their willingness become a candidate with no backing from key political parties.
