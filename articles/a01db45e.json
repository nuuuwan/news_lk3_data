    "Many compliant taxpayers have expressed their frustration with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) for insisting that the Return of Income for the year of assessment 2023/2024 be filed as an electronic return (e-return). It is perplexing why such a requirement is being enforced in a country such as ours where computer skills are woefully lacking. In many other countries the taxpayer is entitled to submit a return either electronically or by hard copy (paper). The choice should be with the taxpayer and not the IRD. In some countries, any tax refunds to individuals are inevitably delayed for those who submit manual returns compared to those who submit e-returns. This incentivises the taxpayer to embrace technology. But here, it is forced down the taxpayer\u2019s throat.",
    "A fundamental principle must be that tax compliance should not result in the taxpayer having to incur additional cost or physical/mental stress in fulfilling their civic obligation of paying their income tax. Many senior citizens are not computer savvy enough to navigate through complex returns or do not have access to a laptop or other paraphernalia needed to upload supporting documents. Therefore, many individual taxpayers who struggle to complete their returns by themselves are now forced to engage the services of a professional tax consultant or accountant to submit their returns. This is an additional cost that taxpayers should not be burdened with. We understand that the IRD reluctantly accepted hard copy (paper) returns from some senior citizen who insisted they could not submit an e-return.",
    "The IRD should concentrate on getting more people liable to pay tax to do so, thus widening the tax net instead of penalizing those who settle their dues but may delay submitting their return for the above mentioned reasons. The Inland Revenue Act provides penalties for failure to file a return on time and for criminal proceedings as well as issuing default assessments where necessary. It has often been said, with good reason, that the IRD bullies people who pay their taxes and submit their returns and does little to tackle blatant evasion which is rampant.",
    "We have been told that taxpayers who receive interest income from fixed deposits are required to enter a significant amount of information into the e-return, which is tedious and unnecessary, particularly if the taxpayer can submit or upload a certificate from the deposit taker confirming the interest received and the advance income tax deducted at source. As in other countries, it is up to the IRD and the deposit taking institutions to devise a compliant digital platform that will enable such information to be uploaded to the IRD\u2019s Random Access Management Information System (RAMIS).",
    "IRD invested hugely in setting up RAMIS but was unable to utilize it effectively over many years. The banks and other deposit, too, have not played their part in this because many banks are not issuing certificates to their customers that disclose all the information required by the IRD. Time was when a blanket 15 percent withholding tax (WHT) was imposed at source on interest and dividend income with no further liability thereafter. This undoubtedly imposed hardship on those not liable for income tax in obtaining notoriously slow refunds from the department and was an advantage to high income earners. Nevertheless, like PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax, it was an easy collection method for IRD.",
    "After the November deadline for submitting the annual return for 2023/24 passed, the IRD issued a circular extending the deadline for submitting tax returns for that year until December 7. The circular cites the difficulties taxpayers encountered last week due to the inclement weather that prevailed in the country. No mention has been made of the RAMIS system being more or less inaccessible in the days leading to the deadline, as it could not deal with too many taxpayers trying to access the system at the same time! The circular also mentions that IRD officials will offer special support until December 6, 2024, for those who visit the department for technical assistance to submit their return online. This is most welcome.",
    "According to currently available information, about a million taxpayers are registered with the IRD. This seems insufficient, considering that more than eight million are employed, and the income threshold for paying income tax is Rs. 100,000 monthly. It will be interesting to know as to how many of the million have submitted their tax returns by the due date or will do so in the next few days and weeks. Undoubtedly, people need to be tax-compliant, but it is also necessary for the IRD to make the process easy for taxpayers to make payments and submit their annual income tax returns.",
    "The IRD currently does not accept cheques for settling tax obligations. A taxpayer must make a direct bank transfer or settle his/her dues through a banker\u2019s pay order. This imposes an unfair added cost on tax payers as well as the inconvenience of having to visit the bank for this purpose. This requirement clearly is intended to ensure that tax cheques do not bounce. But the department is empowered to impose penalties on those whose cheques are dishonoured. Why impose additional burdens on taxpayers accustomed to meet their obligations by writing a cheque instead of visiting a bank and paying for the issue of a banker\u2019s pay order?",
    "The bottom line is that the IRD must be more taxpayer friendly than it is at present. Printing platitudes like \u201cThank you for paying your taxes\u201d on its stationary is just not enough. Honest taxpayers with files on record must not be bullied, as is often done at present, and burdens like the compulsory online payment requirement now imposed as well as the \u2018no cheques\u2019 rule must done away with. Also, the department must take note of the resentment of people who pay taxes long seeing those who do not getting away Scott free.",
