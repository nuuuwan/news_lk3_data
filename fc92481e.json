    "Industrial Exports: Earnings from the exports of industrial goods declined in November 2023, with a significant share of the decline being contributed by garments.

However, earnings from garment exports improved notably in November 2023, compared to October 2023. Further, declines were recorded in the exports of animal fodder (mainly, poultry feed and wheat residues); machinery",
    "Agricultural Exports: Earnings from the exports of agricultural goods improved in November 2023, compared to a year ago, led by tea (mainly, instant tea) exports. An increase of earnings from overall tea exports resulted from the higher export volumes although the unit price of tea exports in November 2023 was lower than a year earlier. Further, export earnings from coconut related products (mainly, fibres and coconut oil) and spices (mainly, cinnamon) increased due to higher export volumes. Meanwhile, there was a decline in export earnings from minor agricultural products (primarily, areca nuts), natural rubber, and vegetables.",

A decline in import expenditure was observed in intermediate goods, mainly resulted from lower expenditure on fuel imports. However, an increase was recorded in imports of investment goods and consumer goods partly due to relaxation of import restrictions. Meanwhile, cumulative import expenditure during January to November 2023 declined by 9.1 per cent to US dollars 15,323 million over the corresponding period in the last year. CBSL",
