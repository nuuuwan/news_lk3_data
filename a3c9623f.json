I'm not advocating that at all. Otherwise, we'll have a lot of people picketing outside my office tomorrow. I am giving an idea on how they did it. People came to climb Siripada long ago; obviously, we have promoted ourselves well. If we are to promote ourselves, the key is hospitality,\" elaborated the President.",
