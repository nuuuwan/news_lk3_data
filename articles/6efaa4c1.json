    "The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) recently hosted Ambassador of the State of Palestine to Sri Lanka Ihab I.M. Khalil for a courtesy call that aimed at strengthening stronger trade ties and exploring new avenues for bilateral cooperation.",
    "The meeting, held at the EDB premises, facilitated a productive discussion on expanding market access for Sri Lankan products in Palestine and encouraging greater collaboration between the two nations.",
    "During the discussions, the EDB highlighted several product sectors with strong potential in the Palestinian market, including Ceylon Tea, natural rubber and rubber-based products, coconut-based products such as desiccated coconut and virgin coconut oil, spices; particularly Ceylon Cinnamon and pepper, processed food and beverages, and Ayurveda and herbal-based personal care products.",
    "As a follow-up, the EDB proposed organising an online awareness session focused on these sectors, with the participation of potential Palestinian buyers, trade chambers, and trade promotion organisations. The initiative aimed to create direct linkages between Sri Lankan exporters and Palestinian counterparts, supported by information sharing and coordinated matchmaking.",
    "Looking ahead, the EDB and the Embassy also discussed the possibility of arranging business delegations, including B2B meetings, factory visits and trade-related engagements, to further strengthen long-term commercial partnerships.",
    "This engagement reflected the EDB\u2019s ongoing commitment to diversifying export markets and building strategic trade relationships with emerging economies, thereby enhancing opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters in the Middle Eastern region."
