  "original_title": "China\u2019s digital yuan: Currency, control, and a new world order?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Imagine opening your digital wallet not to see a bank card or a third-party app like Alipay, but official government-issued currency\u2014straight from your country\u2019s central bank. That\u2019s not science fiction. That\u2019s what China is building with the e-CNY, its new digital version of the yuan. While it might look like a simple upgrade to how people pay for groceries or ride the subway, the e-CNY is much more than that. It\u2019s a carefully planned tool that combines finance, technology, and politics\u2014and it might just shake up the global economy.",
    "At its core, the e-CNY (also known as the digital yuan) is a digital currency created by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC). Unlike cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, it\u2019s fully state-controlled, traceable, and centrally issued. Think of it as the digital twin of China\u2019s paper money\u2014same value, same legal status, but far more programmable.",
    "It works through a two-tiered system. The central bank distributes digital yuan to commercial banks, who then pass it on to the public. Since pilot testing began in 2020, the e-CNY has been quietly used across Chinese cities for daily transactions\u2014from coffee to cab rides, and even at the 2022 Winter Olympics. But its ambitions stretch far beyond convenience.",
    "The digital yuan gives China\u2019s Central Bank new tools to shape its economy. Imagine a currency that can be programmed to work in certain ways\u2014say, speeding up spending during a downturn or targeting stimulus to specific sectors or individuals. It could even help fine-tune interest rate policies or prevent misuse of government relief funds.",
    "This new control could improve financial stability and give policymakers real-time insights into economic activity. For ordinary people and businesses, that might mean more effective policies\u2014but it also raises questions about how much the government should see and control.",
    "The most fascinating part? China doesn\u2019t just want to use the e-CNY at home. It wants it to work across borders. The goal is to reshape international trade and reduce dependence on the US dollar, especially in regions involved in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). That\u2019s a huge deal.",
    "Why? Right now, the US dollar dominates global trade and financial systems. Most international transactions go through US-controlled systems like SWIFT. But these systems can be used for geopolitical pressure\u2014as seen when Russia was excluded from SWIFT in 2022. For many countries, that\u2019s a vulnerability. China wants to offer an alternative: a new payment system based on the e-CNY, outside of US control.",
    "To do this, China has developed its own cross-border payment system, called CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System), designed to work alongside the e-CNY. It\u2019s also been working with central banks in places like Hong Kong, Thailand, and the UAE on joint digital currency trials.",
    "In one pilot project\u2014called mBridge\u2014the e-CNY was the most used digital token, showing its growing influence. If successful, these systems could allow countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to trade with China using digital yuan, bypassing the dollar entirely.",
    "For many developing nations, the e-CNY offers benefits: faster payments, lower costs, protection from dollar swings, and even a way around US sanctions. But it comes at a cost. The digital yuan is tightly controlled and traceable. Anyone using it would need to follow China\u2019s digital surveillance rules, including registering with real names. That\u2019s a tough sell for democracies or countries concerned about data privacy and national autonomy.",
    "There\u2019s also concern about digital dependence. If countries start borrowing in e-CNY or using China\u2019s payment systems too heavily, they could become financially tied to Beijing in ways that are hard to reverse.",
    "Some experts believe the world may be heading toward a split financial system: one led by the G7 countries, still based on the US dollar, and another centred-on China\u2019s digital currency and platforms. This wouldn\u2019t happen overnight\u2014but the pieces are falling into place.",
    "So far, widespread adoption of the e-CNY abroad has been limited. But China is patient, and interest is growing, especially among countries looking for alternatives to the Western financial system. Digital incentives and loans could further accelerate this shift.",
    "Domestically and internationally, privacy is a sticking point. While the e-CNY promises some degree of anonymity, every transaction can still be traced by the authorities. In theory, this helps fight crime. In practice, it raises concerns about surveillance\u2014especially when exported to countries with different political systems or values.",
    "How transparent should digital money be? And how do you balance security with personal freedom? These are tough questions that every country experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) must face.",
    "Make no mistake\u2014the e-CNY is more than a tech innovation. It\u2019s a geopolitical instrument. Just as roads, railways, and ports were symbols of Chinese influence in the BRI, digital currencies could become the financial infrastructure of the future.",
    "In June 2025, China even set up a special centre in Shanghai to promote the international use of the e-CNY. The message is clear: China wants a bigger role in global finance, and digital currency is its ticket.",
    "Many people in China still prefer apps like WeChat Pay. They need good reasons to switch.",
    "Some laws still focus on physical cash, leaving gray areas for digital currency.",
    "If too many people move their money into e-CNY, it could weaken commercial banks and disrupt lending.",
    "China\u2019s tight controls on money flowing in and out of the country limit the digital yuan\u2019s usefulness for global trade.",
    "The e-CNY is still evolving. If China can build trust\u2014through transparent rules, strong data protections, and fair partnerships\u2014it might win broader global support. If not, its reach could be limited to countries already closely aligned with Beijing.",
    "Either way, the world is watching. China\u2019s digital yuan is a bold experiment that could redefine how money works\u2014not just as a tool for transactions, but as a lever of power in the global arena.",
    "The e-CNY isn\u2019t just China\u2019s digital money. It\u2019s a glimpse into a possible future where currency, politics, and technology are tightly woven together. As the digital curtain lifts, countries around the world must decide whether to step through\u2014and what it might cost them.",
