  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Sri Lankan Catholic Church has deplored the appointment of Senior DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon as the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP).",
    "Addressing a media briefing today (Nov.29), Spokesperson of the Colombo Archdiocese Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini said the Catholic Church deems this appointment \u2018an insult\u2019 to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks.",
    "\u201cThe appointment made by the President [Ranil Wickremesinghe] is condemned by His Eminence the Cardinal [Malcolm Ranjith]. At the same time, we vehemently oppose it. We consider this appointment a disgrace to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks.\u201d",
    "When asked if the Catholic Church has any recommendations for the post of the police chief, Rev. Fr. Gamini responded, \u201cWe have no special name to nominate. It is the President who has to make a nomination to the Constitutional Council.\u201d",
    "Speaking further, he expressed doubts as to whether the police would be able to maintain their own discipline, let alone the discipline of the country, following the appointment of new Acting IGP Tennakoon."
