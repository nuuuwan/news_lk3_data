  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says Parliament and Cabinet must prioritise a progressive legislative agenda to reflect people\u2019s mandate",
    "Stresses delays or inaction could erode public trust and hinder vital reforms",
    "Calls for abolishment of Executive Presidency and repealing of PTA and OSA",
    "Urges legislature to adopt transparent, inclusive approach to policy and law-making",
    "The Lawyers\u2019 Collective has called on the newly elected 10th Parliament and Cabinet of Ministers to urgently prioritise a legislative agenda reflecting the clear mandate of the people. In a statement issued yesterday the organisation emphasised the need for transformative reforms to uphold democracy, the Rule of Law, and the sovereignty of the people.",
    "Congratulating the newly elected representatives, the Lawyers\u2019 Collective underscored the historic opportunity to advance a progressive legislative agenda. It warned that delays or inaction could erode public trust and impede the realisation of vital reforms.",
    "Central to the Lawyers\u2019 Collective\u2019s demands are the abolition of the Executive Presidency, a position criticised for enabling autocratic governance and systemic corruption. Citing failed attempts in 2018 and 2022 to curtail the powers of the presidency through constitutional amendments, the Collective urged the Government to place this issue at the forefront of its agenda.",
    "\u201cThe abuse of executive powers has deeply damaged democracy and public institutions over decades,\u201d the statement noted. It argued that constitutional reform to abolish the presidency could be achieved swiftly, drawing on extensive groundwork already completed by various political parties, civil society organisations, and constitutional experts.",
    "The Lawyers\u2019 Collective emphasised the urgency of initiating these reforms early in the Government\u2019s term to avoid political opposition and to ensure a referendum on the amendment reflects its merits rather than being viewed as a referendum on the Government itself.",
    "The Collective also called for the immediate repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979, describing it as a draconian law that undermines human rights and enables the suppression of civic freedoms. Highlighting its misuse by successive Governments, the statement stressed that the PTA\u2019s provisions for arbitrary detention and broad presidential powers are incompatible with democratic principles.",
    "\u201cThe PTA has become synonymous with the erosion of human rights and the misuse of state power,\u201d the statement asserted, adding that repealing it would also contribute to reconciliation and accountability.",
    "The group also criticised the Online Safety Act of 2023, claiming it suppresses free expression under the guise of protecting women and children. The law, which reintroduced criminal liability for defamation, was described as poorly drafted and overly broad.",
    "\u201cIt cannot remain in the legal framework of a democratic society,\u201d the Collective said, urging its immediate repeal.",
    "The Lawyers\u2019 Collective raised alarm over political interference in the autonomy of Sri Lanka\u2019s public university system, pointing to recent controversies at Ruhuna University as a case in point. It called for independent inquiries and reforms to ensure institutional independence and adherence to due process.",
    "The statement criticised the systemic failures in governance, citing decades of mismanagement and political interference, and urged the legislature to adopt a transparent, inclusive approach to policy and law-making.",
    "\u201cThe legislative agenda outlined represents a clear break from autocratic rule to governance by and for the people,\u201d the Collective stated, warning that failure to act on these reforms could betray the mandate granted by voters.",
    "Reaffirming its commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and judicial independence, the Lawyers\u2019 Collective urged the government to engage in dialogue with the public to ensure legitimacy and trust in governance."
