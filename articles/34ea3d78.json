Joining him were distinguished Ministers, industry leaders, and international delegations from key markets, including China, India, the United States, Europe, and beyond. The event also welcomed representatives from globally renowned gem and jewellery companies, many of whom are visiting Sri Lanka for the first time.",
    "FACETS Sri Lanka 2025 shines a spotlight on Sri Lanka\u2019s local \u2018gempreneurs\u2019, hailing from iconic gem-producing regions such as Ratnapura, Beruwala, Galle, Eheliyagoda, and Colombo.

    "Beyond being a showcase of unparalleled gems and jewellery, FACETS Sri Lanka 2025 is a celebration of the country\u2019s rich heritage and a catalyst for industry innovation. This year\u2019s exhibition is packed with exclusive events, including:",

    "The SLGJA said this year, FACETS Sri Lanka 2025 stands as a testament to the industry\u2019s resilience, innovation, and global appeal. As the event unfolds, it is set to create lasting impressions, build meaningful partnerships, and further establish Sri Lanka as a global leader in the gem and jewellery trade.",
    "Industry holds immense potential to become a significant foreign exchange earner and job creator",
    "SLGJA President Akram Cassim in his address said Facets Sri Lanka 2025 is Sri Lanka\u2019s premier international gem and jewellery exhibition, showcasing the entire industry \u2013 from mine to market.",
    "He recalled that 31 years ago, a group of young gem traders who had been displaying their gems at exhibitions around the world envisioned creating an international gem and jewellery show in Sri Lanka. Thus, FACETS was born. The first show was held in 1991 at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo, with just 50 booths.",
    "\u201cThe event was a tremendous success and has since grown into a key platform for the Sri Lankan gem and jewellery industry. Over the past 30 years, FACETS has consistently drawn international gem buyers, some of whom have become long-standing patrons.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt has also played a pivotal role in the growth of small businesses, transforming small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) into leading gem traders, jewellers, and lapidarists. FACETS has continually promoted Sri Lanka as a world-renowned source for Sapphires and over 50 varieties of gemstones,\u201d Cassim said.",
    "He emphasised that the industry holds immense potential to become a significant foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, while also creating employment opportunities across the island.",
    "\u201cHowever, to fully realise this potential, urgent reforms are needed to address the barriers that hinder growth and weaken global competitiveness. Policy changes have, in some cases, driven businesses to relocate overseas. The critical need is for policy reforms to streamline regulatory processes, reduce operational challenges, and improve the overall ease of doing business.\u201d \u201cHigh taxation and rigid import-export regulations are among the most pressing concerns. We look forward to collaborating with the new Government and relevant authorities to establish a business-friendly environment for the gem and jewellery sector,\u201d the SLGJA President pointed out.",
    "According to Cassim, the industry also has the opportunity to integrate more closely with tourism. \u201cPartnering with Sri Lanka Tourism and SriLankan Airlines, we can add tremendous value by offering unique experiences to every tourist visiting our island.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe could create a Sapphire experience for tourists \u2013 one that celebrates Sri Lanka\u2019s 2,500-year legacy of producing the finest Blue Sapphires seen, worn, and admired around the world,\u201d he added.",
    "It was pointed out that Sri Lanka remains one of the world\u2019s leading sources of fine Sapphires and a treasure trove of over 50 varieties of coloured gemstones. \u201cOur island\u2019s gem and jewellery legacy is steeped in mystery, magic, myths, and legends, complemented by centuries of craftsmanship and skill. This legacy deserves to be shared with the world, and tourism is a powerful avenue for doing so.\u201d",
    "FACETS aligns beautifully with principles of \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 initiative",
    "FACETS Sri Lanka 2025 Chairman Armil Sammoon said this year\u2019s FACETS aligns beautifully with the principles of the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 initiative, celebrating not only the brilliance of Sri Lanka\u2019s gemstones but also the transformative progress the nation is striving to achieve.",
    "\u201cAs we embark on this extraordinary three-day journey, we honour the legacy of Sri Lankan gems \u2013 a legacy forged by the interplay of nature\u2019s beauty and humanity\u2019s artistry. FACETS is more than an exhibition; it is a bridge that connects tradition with innovation and provides a platform where our heritage meets global aspirations,\u201d Sammoon said.",
    "Referring to booth holders, he described them as the soul of FACETS 2025. \u201cYour craftsmanship, resilience, and collaboration transform raw treasures into masterpieces that captivate the world. It is your dedication that gives FACETS its vibrancy and sets our industry apart,\u201d Sammoon added.",
    "He said the presence of international visitors and buyers underscored the global allure of Sri Lanka\u2019s gemstones. \u201cYour faith in our industry fuels its growth and strengthens the bonds that unite us beyond borders. You are not just patrons; you are partners in amplifying Sri Lanka\u2019s potential on the world stage,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "The FACETS Sri Lanka 2025 Chairman expressed his gratitude to policymakers for their support in ensuring this industry continues to shine. \u201cFACETS is more than a marketplace \u2013 it is a beacon of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and cultural significance. Your recognition of its importance lays the foundation for sustainable growth, innovation, and inclusivity,\u201d Sammoon said.",
    "\u201cInspired by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s call for unity, progress, and shared responsibility, FACETS 2025 embraces the ideals of renewal and transformation. Together, we aim to uplift rural communities, foster innovation, and embed ethical practices that honour our people and our land,\u201d Sammoon said, adding, \u201cAs we showcase the brilliance of our gemstones, let us remember that each stone tells a story \u2013 a story of origins, craftsmanship, and dreams. These stories light the way forward for a united and prosperous Sri Lanka.\u201d"
