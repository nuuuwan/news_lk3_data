    "Following a chilling economic bankruptcy, an alarming political instability and heavy- laden yet with multiple issues at stake, Sri Lanka enters the celebration of Christmas and its festive season of 2024. Nevertheless, despite the dark clouds of uncertainty and almost bereft of resources and still struggling for survival with the IMF aid, we are reaching out to the silver-lining of an event that instills courage and stirs up hope, freeing us from undue fear and anxiety. We are entering into the spirit of joy and peace as we join nations and continents across the world in the global celebration of the feast of Christmas: the birth of Jesus Christ. Once a marginal Jew from Nazareth in Galilee of northern Palestine of old, he is at the center of this festival and captures the limelight of the season. His unique birth has left an indelible mark on the horizons of humanity as well as in the vast expanse of world history and human civilisation. The world seems not to be the same ever since this first Christmas that graced Bethlehem of old in the Middle-Eastern West Asia, the land of Israel and today\u2019s Palestine. As Sri Lanka lives through very demanding and difficult times, we can look up to this historical figure whose beginnings, life and work were marked by humble circumstances in a carpenter\u2019s home becoming an icon of humanity and an epitome of a reformer who brought in a radical transformation of society. The spiritual movement he launched from west Asia evolving eventually into the religion of Christianity traversed from Palestine, through the great cities of Greece and Rome into the empires of the Byzantium and later expanded through colonial powers of Western Europe like Portugal, Spain, Britain, Germany, France, Holland and Belgium. The Irish migration into the states of America completed the Christian expansion into that continent. South America, Asia and Africa, the regions of the southern hemisphere got in touch with it through colonial channels. As of today, 2.63 billion in the world profess the Christian faith which amounts to nearly 31.6% of the global population (8,19 billion). The saga of the humble Nazarene who began by being an itinerant preacher and healer in his homeland has now come to stay as an epic religious figure through his teachings and his followers across nations, cultures and continents. He is now the Eternal Galilean.",
    "There are some distinctive features that characterise the event of Christmas. On purpose the Bible puts it in a radical context of poverty, for the child Jesus was born in the backyard of an inn on a cold winter\u2019s night and in a city crowded with people, who had converged for a census ordered by Caesar. There was no decent place for a woman pregnant with child and a family expecting their first-born. Expectations were high but conditions were poor. This scene is dramatically created in every crib that comes up in churches, homes and public places. Though devotees may be in their best of festive attire, they will be obliged to venerate the Lord only in the cribs where he lies in a manger of straw with swaddling clothes for warmth. Those who were privileged to be his first guests were the shepherds who were keeping their flocks by night who hastened in joy at the good news from a chorus of angels that rang out in the stillness of the night over the hills of Bethlehem. Shepherds were considered a very low social class and raring of sheep was not much of a high-class profession. They returned to their flocks sharing what they saw as they went along. Even before getting back home, disaster struck the new family, for Herod struck by a rumour that the Messiah of the Jews was born was out to kill him in a carefully crafted mass murder of innocent new-born children in his jurisdiction. The only way of escape for the family was to go into exile fleeing into Egypt and stranded there till Herod was dead. Egypt was a bad memory, for it was there that for nearly 430 years the ancestors of Jesus lived in slavery subjected to the severest forms of oppression under Pharaohs. The journey was treacherous too. Once back in their home-town in Nazareth of Galilee, the child grew up in age, wisdom and grace thought to be the son of a carpenter.",
    "At the age of thirty Jesus decided to take on his task. He left home, gathered a band of disciples chosen from among fishermen and together roamed the cities, the towns and villages, also from time to time heading to Jerusalem for various festivals and for preaching. It is here that he met his final fate by crucifixion due mainly to the fact that he opposed the hypocrisy of the religious authorities as well as his claim to be divine and being falsely accused of refusing allegiance to Caesar. Becoming a bone of contention, there also arose waves of social protests against him. The very moving story of his passion and death contain the graphic details of these fateful events. Yet, a radical change came over when he was seen alive as the Risen Lord which triggered the courage of his disciples to carry his story beyond Jerusalem to the great cities of ancient Roman Empire including Athens, the intellectual and cultural centre and imperial Rome itself, the seat of the Emperor. Thus, Communities of believers sprang up everywhere and Christianity got firmly grounded in various parts of the ancient world.",
    "The story of Jesus of Nazareth who gave us the first-ever Christmas taught respect of human dignity and fostering of brotherhood. He taught the true worship of God leading to love and care of the neighbor. He took sides more with the spirit of the law than its letter. The classic Sermon on the Mount he proclaimed introduces us to his new world that demands a spectrum of values brazenly contravening the spirit of the world where materialism and hedonism sway people into absolutely despicable mind-sets and behaviours-patterns. The poor, those who suffer and struggle for truth and justice are declared blessed. Love of the enemy and limitless sense of charity, compassion and forgiveness are virtues that ennoble social relationships. By freeing people from decease, comforting those who were disturbed and making light the yoke of those who felt weighed down and burdened, he became a source of solace. Often it is mental worries and emotional stress that bring immense suffering to many who would otherwise be comfortable. The spirit of the world also drugs people into consumerism and abuse of freedom that can create social differences and conflicts. We live in a world where libertine thinking has weakened even the moral sense of ethics that ensures good social order. One laments the fact that the moral development as well as the sense of humanity have not kept pace with development in science and technology. This is the crisis of post-modernity that breeds struggles as well as confrontations at times turning complex beyond remedy. Many countries are undergoing a major economic shift from a centrally planned, export-oriented economy to a more market-driven, consumer-focused one, marked by a move towards higher-value manufacturing, technological advancement, and a greater focus on domestic consumption, all the while navigating challenges like a depleting population and the need for structural reforms within its political system.",
    "The spirit of Christmas brings back the great teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. It first concerns the dignity of human beings and what it means to be human, a state that he himself embraced. Christmas exalts motherhood and family life together with the duty of parenting which the children having the fundamental right to receive. It places high premium on the sanctity of marriage and the duty inherent in creating a home of love and affection. The family continues to be the basic unit of society. Family clusters are the building blocks of a healthy and robust society where the sense of humanity appears first. It is the school of humanity and the educator of morality where healthy and warm relationships are first experienced and learnt. Christmas recalls the dignity and precious value of labour that provides dignified livelihood. Christmas story carries the tale of a worker-family replete with life\u2019s struggles. In the home of Nazareth, the family of Jesus knew the battle in life to keep the home fires burning. Living in the rural surroundings, they knew the challenges affronting those of a lower middle-class family. They kept faithful to their cultural and religious traditions as any other family. There was no extravagance in their life-style and had to be content with the income of an ordinary working family living in a manner that was thrifty and simple. Living in a border fishing village they saw the work and trying social culture of hard work and toil of fisher-folk. The fact that young Jesus venturing on his task associating with fishermen shows that he was quite alive to the struggles of workers. The family scenario of Nazareth teaches us to avoid a culture of waste. Let Christmas 2024 be one of simple celebration with emphasis on the care of the poor and being aware of their life-struggles. As a debt-ridden and crisis-laden country with people under heavy pressure, we are morally bound to identify with the trials and travail of the majority in our country much deprived of a contented living. Let Christmas 2024 be a harbinger of a determined resolve of all Sri Lankans for rebuilding their motherland.",
