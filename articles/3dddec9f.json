    "TNA MP Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam yesterday raised concerns in Parliament over the appointment of Ranga Dissanayake as Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC).",
    "Rasamanickam alleged that some members of the Constitutional Council who took part in the appointment vote themselves face serious allegations of corruption. He also criticised the lack of visible progress in investigations involving members of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP).",
    "Dissanayake, a former High Court Judge, has come under fire over alleged political affiliations during his judicial career, which he has denied.",
    "Meanwhile, Government lawmakers are also facing scrutiny following reports that over 300 containers were released from the Colombo Port without mandatory Customs inspection, an issue now under Parliamentary review."
