  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israel\u2019s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and prayed there, violating a decades-old arrangement covering one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East.",
    "Photos and videos of his visit show Ben-Gvir leading Jewish prayers at the compound, which is known by Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem.",
    "Praying at the site breaks a long-time arrangement that allows Jews to visit the site but not pray.",
    "The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office released a statement saying there had been no change to Israel\u2019s policy of maintaining the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.",
    "Jordan, custodian of the site, called Ben-Gvir\u2019s latest visit \u201can unacceptable provocation\u201d.",
    "Hamas called it \u201ca deepening of the ongoing aggressions against our Palestinian people\u201d, while a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the visit \u201ccrossed all red lines\u201d.",
    "The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.",
    "It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.",
    "Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.",
    "Waqf, the Islamic endowment which runs the site, said Ben-Gvir was among 1,250 Jews who ascended the compound on Sunday morning.",
    "Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist who as national security minister oversees the police, has visited the site before, but the Times of Israel reported this was the first time that he openly prayed at the site.",
    "He was flanked by police officers while entering and touring the compound.",
    "In a statement at the site, Ben-Gvir said \u201chorror\u201d video of hostages recently released by Hamas, in which they appear emaciated, were aimed at putting pressure on Israel, and called for the hostages\u2019 return.",
    "The minister also repeated his call for Israel to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip and to encourage what he described as \u201cvoluntary emigration\u201d of Palestinians from the territory.",
    "Experts say this would amount to the forced displacement of civilians, and a possible war crime.",
    "He has been sanctioned by the UK for \u201crepeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities\u201d in the occupied West Bank."
