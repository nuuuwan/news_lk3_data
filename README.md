There is renewed expectation that the new Government will approach an investigation into the Easter bombings with a real commitment towards unearthing the truth

Easter 2025 will mark the sixth anniversary of the Easter tragedy. A new President, a new Parliament with the enviable record of being the only single party to ever gain a two-thirds majority in Parliament have all the necessary implements to ensure that a full and impartial investigation is carried out. All members of this new administration also have the distinction of not having been involved in any shape or form in the events that led to this tragedy. This tragedy has left a permanent black mark on Sri Lanka’s ability to sustain meaningful compliance of international treaties and honour in full the UN charter on the right to life

### No Muslim in Cabinet: Does that matter?

In this new era should the absence of a Muslim or Tamil in the Cabinet matter at all?

Yet, one or two Muslim ministers in the Cabinet carries economic value in the international arena. When the Sirimavo Government in the 1970s faced a foreign exchange crisis the Muslim minister Badi was sent to the Middle East to canvas for more foreign aid from the Arab world and he succeeded to a certain extent. Similarly, when JR’s open economy faced an oil crisis his Muslim Foreign Minister Hameed was dispatched to Libya and Ghaddafi did not send his visitor empty handed. Thus, given the seriousness of the economic challenges facing the NPP Government, at least one talented Muslim minister in the Cabinet would be an invaluable asset to tackle them. Let common sense prevail and the damage caused rectified by the President

The 2024 Parliamentary elections symbolise a pivotal moment of transition for Sri Lanka – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

I have always been deeply interested in Sri Lanka’s socio-political landscape and its complex history for three main reasons. First, as an ethnic Tamil minority who endured the brutalities of war during childhood, this subject holds personal significance. Second, my father, the late Sundaram Divakalala—a renowned Tamil civil servant—dedicated his life to public service, inspiring my interest in governance and justice. Finally, my professional experience at CMG Capital Maharaja Group, Sri Lanka’s largest private conglomerate and media powerhouse, under the leadership of its late Chairman, Late Kili Rajamahendran, further deepened my understanding of the nation’s challenges and potential.

The absence of a Muslim member among the 21 members that comprise the Cabinet remains unanswerable

The recently elected NPP Government appointed its Cabinet of Ministers this Monday, 21 November. A large proportion of the members are new faces but appear an intelligent and able lot. A notable feature is the absence of a Muslim Minister. The active roles played by the Muslim community at large both at the Presidential as well as the General election in favour of the NPP was duly acknowledged and accepted by the NPP and the President. While anxiety must be pouring through and amongst almost all the new faces in the Parliament, a feeling of anger is pouring through among the Muslim community. Both feelings are quite natural.

Now serving as Ukraine’s envoy to the United Kingdom, Mr Zaluzhny pointed to the direct involvement of Russia’s autocratic allies as a significant factor in the war’s global expansion.
