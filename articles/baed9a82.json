The Government Information Department further added that the distribution of fertilizer for tea plantations is being implemented in 3 stages.",
    "Meanwhile, it has also been discussed to provide fertilizer and also plant tea saplings in vacant areas of land with the aim of increasing the tea harvest in the coming year.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry has generated foreign reserves of USD 1 to 1.2 billion during the last two years.",
    "The island nation exports tea to 150 countries worldwide out of which 20 countries purchase stocks of tea on a large scale.",
