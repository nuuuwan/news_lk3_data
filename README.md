### The Government’s Term Tests & Results: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

*2024-12-23 11:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-governments-term-tests-results-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) · `en`

A newspaper editorial suggested that the NPP government is facing its December term test and that its weaknesses are showing. In fact, there have been quite a few term tests set up by different pundit examiners and they are producing a mixed bag of results. Overall and objectively, if I may say so, the government has done a reasonably good job for the most part; with a few bads, mainly gaffes, including a Prime Ministerial gaffe involving the two ‘Chinas’; and one standout ugly – the pathetic “PhD in Biochemistry and BSc in Chemical Engineering” lies of Asoka Ranwala MP, and his deservedly quick fall from Speakership grace. The focus has been mostly on his PhD boast, but his claim to a degree in Chemical Engineering is itself an instant hoax. And the leap from Chemical Engineering in Moratuwa to Biochemistry in Japan is manifestly ignorant and creatively stupid.

### AHRC urges President to tackle judicial and legal reforms

*2024-12-23 02:59:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/AHRC-urges-President-to-tackle-judicial-and-legal-reforms/56-770918) · `en`

The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to prioritise and enact critical legal reforms to strengthen the rule of law in Sri Lanka.

In a written appeal, AHRC Policy and Programs Director Basil Fernando highlighted significant shortcomings in the country’s legal and judicial systems that require immediate attention. The organisation outlined three key areas for reform to ensure justice, transparency, and accountability.

The AHRC called for the daily hearing of serious criminal cases in High Courts to address judicial delays and expedite justice delivery. This, it argued, would significantly improve the efficiency of the judiciary.

Second, the organisation stressed the urgency of introducing comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. Such reforms are essential, the AHRC said, to rebuild public trust in governance and ensure greater accountability across all levels of Government.

The case was taken up before Court of Appeal Judges Sobitha Rajakaruna and Mohan Goppalawa, where legal counsel for both parties agreed to mediate the matter further. Consequently, the contempt charges filed by the petitioners against the defendants for allegedly violating Supreme Court guidelines on pilgrim selection were withdrawn.

During the proceedings, the defendants agreed to adhere to the Supreme Court’s guidelines for selecting travel agents, which had been central to the dispute. The Hajj Committee was granted discretion to allocate the quota of pilgrims to travel operators in accordance with these guidelines.

### Ranil Wickremesinghe may act as the main person to challenge this government - Udaya Kammanpila

*2024-12-23 02:46:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201917) · `ta`

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



Ranil Wickremesinghe may challenge current Sri Lankan government. Udaya Kammanpila claims world nations seeking Wickremesinghe's advice on recovery from bankruptcy. Wickremesinghe remains active in politics despite others retiring. His economic policies implemented by current president. Wickremesinghe led government during 2022 financial crisis, helping short-term recovery. Unlike other ex-presidents, Wickremesinghe enjoys better relations with Western nations.

🟩

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe may act as the main person who challenges this government. Former parliamentarian Udaya Kammanpila said that the world's countries, which have become bankrupt over the short term in the short term, are consulting with Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Does not completely retire from politics. We are involved in operating politics. Sri Lanka's Sri Lanka PA was defeated in 2024 with the support of the majority of the 2020s.. Similarly, the National People's Power, which received 3 seats on that day, has won 159 seats today so something can happen in politics.

Former President Mahinda Rajapakse retires from politics. Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa has been paid attention to the leadership of the Sri Lanka PA.

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe does not retire from politics. He may act as the main person to challenge this government. This is because President Anurakumara Dissanayake is implementing his economic policies.
