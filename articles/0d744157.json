    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Out of 58.6 billion rupees of uncollected revenues of Sri Lanka Customs, 57.7 billion rupees related to state agencies, Chief Financial Officer M A Muthukude said.",
    "The arrears came due to various facilities given to state agencies to clear goods at in past year, he told reporters in Colombo.",
    "Out of 38 parties that from whom uncollected taxes were due, 37 were state agencies.",
    "The state agencies were given various accommodations to release goods and the money was now owned to various ministries.",
    "Even for the state agencies to pay the taxes, the Treasury will probably have to make an allocation to the relevant ministry to pay the customs charge and the likelihood of the Treasury getting any net revenue was low, Muthukuke said.  (Colombo/Aug26/2024)"
