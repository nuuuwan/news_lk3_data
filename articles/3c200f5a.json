    "Sri Lanka fought back to dismiss Afghanistan for 198, before ending day one of the one-off Test at the Singhalese Sports Club (SSC) on 80 for 0.",
    "Left arm fast bowler Vishwa Fernando accounted for three of Afghanistan's middle-order batters, along with the scalp of opener Noor Ali, to finish with figures of 4 for 51, the best of the hosts\u2019 bowlers.",
    "Right-arm fast bowler Asitha Fernando and left arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya finished with three wickets a piece, as Afghanistan collapsed to lose their last six wickets for 43 and struggled to find big contributions outside of Rahmat Shah\u2019s 91.",
    "In his first outing as the next Sri Lanka Test captain, Dhananjaya de Silva bucked conventional wisdom by opting to bowl first at the historically bat-first SSC \u2013 a decision likely to have been influenced by the green-top pitch \u2013 with the hosts\u2019 playing three fast bowlers, which include debutant Chamika Gunasekera.",
    "That decision appeared justified when Asitha Fernando dismissed opener Ibrahim Zadran on the second ball of the innings, but a combination of occasionally ill-disciplined bowling and the pitch not providing as much assistance as hoped, led to Afghanistan reaching lunch on 90 for 2 and denying the home team early success.",
    "Two wickets in the space of one run after lunch however gave Sri Lanka the inroad they needed, Afghanistan slipping to 110 for 4, even as Shah continued his defiance and closed in on a century.",
    "Shah, who had put on partnerships of 57 with Noor Ali and 52 with Hashmatullah Shahidi for the second and third wickets respectively, he continued that resistance as the chief contributor in a 45-run, fifth-wicket stand with Ikram Alikhil.",
    "His wicket then, the fifth to fall, proved vital for Sri Lanka, and came as a result of some excellence wicket-keeping from Sadeera Samarawickrama.",
    "Anticipating a sweep from Shah, Samarawickrama slip to his left even before the ball made contact with the bat, perfectly in place to snare a catch at backward short-leg off the bowling of Jayasuriya.",
    "Afghanistan reached tea on 168 for 5, shortly after Shah\u2019s dismissal, but lost their remaining five wickets for 29 runs to be bowled out for 198.",
    "In response, Sri Lanka\u2019s openers saw out the day, with Dimuth Karunaratne on 42 not out and Nishan Madushka unbeaten on 36."
