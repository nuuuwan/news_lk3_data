Voting matters regardless of political views. Economic policies affect daily life, including housing, transportation, education, healthcare, and taxes. Political decisions impact personal freedoms, opportunities, and quality of life. Voting gives citizens a voice in shaping their country's future.

Why do you need to vote, even if you like politics?

Are you like this, "I don't like politics,"?"I don't care about politics, I am living,"?

Do you think you don't have to afford to politics?But did you know that politics would affect your everyday life?

Today, young people have the same problem with stabilization.

Many people have still been a dream that many have still been a dream of buying a car, buying a car, rent their own home or rent home.

With the economic situation in the country, you may not be able to meet your expectations on the salary you take. How do you get involved with your expectations this year?

Politics intervenes until selecting a land for building a house. When you get a loan to create a home, the debt interest rates you have to pay for the economic situation in the country. It is through the decision to make your home and the prices of the products and services needed to make.

Much of what is sought to be achieved on the foreign relations front would depend on who the ‘right persons’ are to be entrusted with the responsibility of representing Sri Lanka. This is not about missions only, it is also about what should have been the diplomatic powerhouse of Sri Lanka – the Foreign Ministry. I mean the collective, not one individual. It would do well to consider merit alongside probity, astuteness, temperament, maturity and resilience as among criteria for appointment of right persons. These are missing attributes in the Foreign Service nowadays, temperament undoubtedly topping the list. What is denoted by ‘right’ here is the right mix, and not being politically on the right side. The latter of course was the cause of many diplomatic misadventures in the recent past

Suresh Premachandran warns of national degradation if JVP gains seats. Former TNA MP criticizes JVP's handling of Tamil issues.

Crisis may occur if national people's power doesn't secure 113 seats. Tamil party needs strong policy support. Young women should represent Parliament to address Tamil national problems effectively.

Some people consider what the national people give the power of power. You will think six months after voting for the present state side. So wait up to six months. Suresh Premachandran, a former member of the Democratic Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and former Member of Parliament, said they would not solve the problems of the Tamil people.

He was speaking at a media briefing held at the Jaffna Media Center on Monday (11).

The President who came to Jaffna has made some comments. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who arrived in Jaffna before the presidential election, said that if his party government was formed, he would do many issues, including the repeal of the Terrorism Act.. But when Anura Kumara Dissanayake is currently in power, the general secretary of the party makes no comments.

It would not be possible if the JVP would release the land of the Tamil people by speaking with the army. The same was true of the Rajapaksa period.
