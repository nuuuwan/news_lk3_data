    "Former Executive Director of the National Lotteries Board (NLB), Thusitha Halloluwa, has been further remanded until September 4 by the Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court, said Ada Derana reporter.",
    "The order was issued by Colombo Additional Magistrate Lahiru Silva after considering the submissions made by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and the suspect\u2019s legal representatives during the hearing of the case.",
    "Halloluwa has been named as a suspect in connection with a shooting incident that took place on May 17 in Narahenpita area, targeting a vehicle he was traveling in.",
    "When the case was called, officers of the CCD informed court that the suspect had attempted to evade investigations, and therefore, a warrant had been obtained to arrest him, after which he was produced before court.",
    "Although the suspect was initially identified as a victim in the incident, police revealed that subsequent investigations showed discrepancies between his initial statements and later findings.",
    "Accordingly, he has been named the 11th suspect in the case and taken into custody, police informed court.",
    "Police further stated that the incident appears to have been orchestrated by the suspect with the intention of discrediting the incumbent government and the President, and requested that he be further remanded due to ongoing investigations.",
    "Appearing on behalf of the suspect, Attorney Athula S. Ranagala argued before court that none of the allegations made against his client were substantiated by the \u2018B Report\u2019 submitted to court.",
    "He further submitted that the report contains no consolidated evidence regarding the allegations, and therefore requested court to release the suspect on appropriate bail.",
    "After reviewing the submissions, the Additional Magistrate ordered that the suspect be further remanded until September 4 and stated that the decision regarding bail request would be announced on that date."
