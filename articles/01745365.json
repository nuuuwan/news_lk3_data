    "In the wake of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, hundreds of thousands of mostly young people are looking to migrate for employment, and seeking better opportunities abroad. By the end of 2022, over 300,000 people had left the country, many of them professionals. These individuals are looking for greener pastures and a way to support their families. Meanwhile, a key obstacle facing potential migrants is English language proficiency assessment, which is a key requirement for migration to popular destinations such as Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries. Against this backdrop, Pearon\u2019s PTE suit of English exams is helping to facilitate these young people as they seek to achieve their dreams on foreign shores. In fact, during 2023, over 3200 applications were made by Sri Lankans seeking Permant Residency status in Canada, with 84% receiving approval, highlighting the promising prospects for aspiring Sri Lankans.",

Alongside the launch, a partner meet was also held for Pearson\u2019s key agents and partners in Sri Lanka. During the event, which was held at Shangrila Colombo, officials from Pearson South Asia took the opportunity to highlight the valuable contributions of its Sri Lankan agents and celebrate their achievements.",
