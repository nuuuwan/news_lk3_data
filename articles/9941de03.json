    "Accuses NPP of reneging on its campaign promise to raise public sector wages",
    "Claims party is dismissing Udaya R. Seneviratne report citing laws in it",
    "Reiterates his Govt. allocated funds for wage increase despite current Govt. insisting he has not",
    "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called on State sector employees to withhold their support for the ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party unless it commits to implementing the wage increase recommended by the Udaya R. Seneviratne report.",
    "Speaking at a National Democratic Front (NDF) gathering in Kandy, Wickremesinghe accused the NPP of reneging on its campaign promise to raise public sector wages. He claimed the party was dismissing the report\u2019s proposal for a Rs. 20,000 wage increase in two stages by pointing out flaws in the report.",
    "Wickremesinghe questioned why the current Government could not implement the wage hike now. He reminded attendees that he had established the Udaya R. Seneviratne committee in response to the NPP\u2019s criticism that the Rs. 10,000 increase he had provided was inadequate. He insisted he had set aside funds for an initial Rs. 10,000 increase to be disbursed in early 2025, despite the Government\u2019s denial of any such allocation.",
    "\u201cThey are still refusing to grant this increment. Why can\u2019t they provide it? In March, we issued a Rs. 5,000 increment, and arrears of another Rs. 5,000 are pending. I ask the Government: Are you prepared to grant this or not? I demand an answer,\u201d he said, adding that the President, Prime Minister, and Cabinet Ministers had all criticised the report as flawed.",
    "Wickremesinghe urged public sector voters to withhold their support until the NPP commits to the wage increase. \u201cThey pledged to raise wages and won votes, but now they are lying,\u201d he claimed.",
    "In response, the Government has maintained that any salary increase would be included in the 2025 Budget and implemented in 2026. Cabinet Spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya have repeatedly clarified that Wickremesinghe has not allocated funds for an immediate wage increase before leaving office, and therefore, the increase can only be included in the next Budget. Herath accused the previous administration of making election promises without financial backing.",
    "\u201cThe Government will review the Udaya R. Seneviratne report and will not deceive public servants,\u201d Herath said this week, assuring that a salary increase aligned with the cost of living would be provided.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s public service comprises over 1.3 million employees, with the Government allocating approximately Rs. 1,200 billion for their salaries and allowances."
