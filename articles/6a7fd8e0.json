    "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya has dismissed reports claiming that she visited former President Ranil Wickremesinghe who is currently receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) of the Colombo National Hospital. She challenged anyone who has evidence to the contrary to come forward and present them.",
    "At a press conference, Prime Minister Harini challenged the media organization that spread the fabricated information to provide evidence.",
    "She further commented, \u201cI think we will have to take legal action against those who spread fake news. Disbursing fake news like this is unacceptable. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. If I went, there should be some evidence to support that news. Present the evidence. You can\u2019t just create news out of thin air.\u201d",
    "The Prime Minister also questioned, \u201cIf I did go, where did that information come from? Has anyone seen me visiting the former president in hospital?\u201d",
    "As the country\u2019s Prime Minister, she emphasized that she is not able to visit places without being noticed by the public. \u201cI can\u2019t just go wherever I want without it being noticed. Prove that I went,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI challenge you to prove that I went. If you can prove it, then fine, this issue will be resolved. If I\u2019m wrong, if I\u2019m lying, then prove it. Then, it will be resolved,\u201d she added."
