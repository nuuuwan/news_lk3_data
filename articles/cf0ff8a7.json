    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it has assigned a First-Time Rating of \u2018A+(lka)\u2019 Outlook Stable to Asia Asset Finance.",
    "\u201cFitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka-based Asia Asset Finance PLC a first-time National Long-Term Rating of \u2018A+(lka)\u2019 with a Stable outlook,\u201d the rating agency said.",
    "Fitch Assigns Asia Asset Finance a First-Time Rating of \u2018A+(lka)\u2019; Outlook Stable",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo/Mumbai \u2013 07 Feb 2024: Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka-based Asia Asset Finance PLC a first-time National Long-Term Rating of \u2018A+(lka)\u2019 with a Stable outlook.",
    "Asia Asset Finance is a 72.9%-owned subsidiary of India-based Muthoot Finance Ltd (MFL,BB/Stable). Its core business is in gold-backed lending, similar to its parent. Asia Asset Finance has a small market share of 1.6% of total finance and leasing company (FLC) industry assets.",
    "Shareholder Support Drives Rating: Asia Asset Finance\u2019s rating reflects our expectation that MFL will provide extraordinary support to its subsidiary if required. We believe MFL has the financial ability and incentive to provide support, given its majority shareholding, record of capital infusions and strategic and operational alignment in its subsidiary\u2019s core product \u2013 gold-backed loans. This is counterbalanced by Asia Asset Finance\u2019s small size and contribution to MFL, limited brand sharing and different operating jurisdiction.",
    "Limited Role and Contribution: Asia Asset Finance\u2019s rating is constrained by our view of its modest role and contribution within MFL group. This is based on its small size relative to its major shareholder, separate geographical market and regulatory framework, and performance that has been affected by Sri Lanka\u2019s difficult operating conditions. We believe Asia Asset Finance plays a less significant role in MFL\u2019s franchise relative to the parent\u2019s other financing subsidiaries in India, which help to broaden MFL\u2019s franchise in its home market.",
    "Strategic Integration: Asia Asset Finance\u2019s business model aligns with MFL\u2019s core product of gold-backed loans, following its transition from vehicle financing and unsecured loans.",
    "MFL has a clear influence on Asia Asset Finance\u2019s business strategy and maintains oversight of execution at the board level. The shareholder also appoints three non-executive directors on Asia Asset Finance\u2019s eight-member board and has seconded an employee to head its gold-loan internal audit team. Nonetheless, some differences remain due to the entities\u2019 separate jurisdictions and local market practices.",
    "Adequate Ordinary Capital Support: MFL has provided adequate and timely capital support to Asia Asset Finance since it acquired the company in 2014. It infused around LKR400 million in 2019 to support the subsidiary\u2019s business growth. A further LKR413 million was infused in 2021 to meet the increased minimum regulatory capital requirement of LKR2.5 billion for Sri Lankan FLCs, ahead of the stipulated compliance deadline.",
    "Weak Standalone Credit Profile: We consider Asia Asset Finance\u2019s intrinsic credit strength to be significantly weaker than its support-driven rating. This stems from its modest domestic franchise, evolving risk practices, weak execution record and high debt/tangible equity ratio of 7.1x as at end-September 2023. The company\u2019s delinquency ratio also exceeds the sector average, mainly due to significantly higher non-performing loans in its legacy non-gold loan book.",
    "Stabilising Economic Outlook: We expect the operating environment for Sri Lankan FLCs to continue to stabilise following the inflation and interest rate shocks over the past two years. Easing inflation and interest rate pressures should provide steadier conditions for FLC sector performance. Some headwinds linger, as higher taxes will continue to weigh on household finances in 2024. Investor confidence will also take time to recover. Nonetheless, we expect the economic activity to improve in FY25 as GDP growth recovers.",
    "Modest Franchise, Gold-Lending Niche: Asia Asset Finance is a small FLC with around 1.5% market share of industry loans and deposits. It has a niche in gold-backed lending and accounts for around 7% of sector gold loans. Asia Asset Finance derives some benefits from MFL\u2019s domain knowledge in gold-backed lending. However, differences in regulatory frameworks and lending practices between Sri Lanka and India are likely to result in varied portfolio performance relative to MFL\u2019s performance in India.",
    "High Appetite for Gold Loans: Asia Asset Finance\u2019s high gold-loan exposure heightens its market risk due to gold price fluctuations. We regard gold collateral as liquid in terms of recoverability, but this is counterbalanced by Asia Asset Finance\u2019s aggressive risk appetite within the segment. For example, it has a history of elevated loan/value ratios and a high annualised gold-loan growth rate of 56% from FY18 to FY23. Asia Asset Finance plans to diversify into small-ticket mortgages and vehicle loans to ease its concentration risk, but this is subject to execution risk.",
    "Significant Asset-Quality Risks: We expect Asia Asset Finance\u2019s asset quality metrics to remain weak in the near term, as legacy delinquent loans take time to resolve. Some borrowers may also face residual financial pressure after the difficult economic conditions over the past few years. The company\u2019s gold-backed portfolio should mitigate credit losses, due to the typically healthy recoverability of gold collateral, but this may be tested against its generous risk parameters and still challenging operating conditions.",
    "Asia Asset Finance\u2019s 90-day non-performing loan ratio of 24.7% stood above the industry\u2019s 19.9% at end-September 2023, driven by its legacy portfolio.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "Asia Asset Finance\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in MFL\u2019s credit profile as well as our opinion around MFL\u2019s ability and propensity to extend timely extraordinary support. Developments that could lead to negative rating action include:",
    "\u2013 Meaningful reduction in the parent\u2019s ownership, control or influence that could weaken its propensity to support the subsidiary",
    "\u2013 Notable decline in capital buffers, indicating reduced timeliness in financial support to back growth",
    "\u2013 Weakening alignment of Asia Asset Finance\u2019s gold loan practices with its parent\u2019s policies, denoting a lower level of integration",
    "\u2013 Sustained underperformance that increases the management and reputational burden for MFL",
    "\u2013 Insufficient or delayed liquidity support from MFL that hinders Asia Asset Finance\u2019s ability to meet its obligations in a timely manner",
    "Such developments could significantly reduce shareholder support prospects and, if severe, may lead to the ratings being based off Asia Asset Finance\u2019s standalone credit profile. This would imply a multi-notch downgrade.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "\u2013 A significantly greater strategic role for Asia Asset Finance within MFL group",
    "\u2013 Greater sharing of the Muthoot brand name besides the gold-loan product",
    "However, we view these developments as less likely in the near-term in light of Asia Asset Finance\u2019s different operating jurisdiction and small size relative to MFL.",
    "REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING",
    "The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.",
    "Rating of the entity is linked to its parent\u2019s, MFL, rating."
