    "Political sideshows continue to eclipse major developments on the economic front. The Sri Lankan public apparently finds them as engaging as TikTok videos. News about arrests and detentions continue to dominate the local media scene much to the glee of the NPP government, which is trying to gain political mileage therefrom and distract the public from crucial issues that remain unresolved.",
    "It was reported on Tuesday that due to lack of evidence, former Minister Duminda Dissanayake had been released from a much-publicised case filed against him over the detection of an assault rifle in a high-end apartment in Colombo. His release, after being held on remand for weeks, is a matter of political significance.",
    "The police and government propagandists made a song and dance about Dissanayake\u2019s arrest over the aforementioned assault rifle with some gold-coloured parts so much so that he was nicknamed \u201cThe Man with Golden Gun\u201d, like the anti-hero in the James Bond movie of the same name. That is a sobriquet a politician will do everything in his power to avoid.",
    "Every regime change in this country is followed by a season of widespread arrests and detentions, with the supporters of the incoming government welcoming them and their political rivals crying foul. There is no gainsaying that serious offences politicians and their cronies commit with impunity, ranging from the theft of state funds to murder, while in power, should be probed and the perpetrators brought to justice at least after they lose their hold on power and become \u2018as defenceless as bananas without the skin\u2019, to use local slang. But this should be done in a manner that is both substantively and visibly fair if the incoming dispensation is to bolster its credibility, demonstrate sincerity of purpose and mobilise adequate public support for its efforts to enforce accountability, eliminate impunity and, above all, disprove the allegations of political witch-hunts.",
    "It is only natural that politicians who face legal action after losing power stage protests, playing the victim card. However, instances are not infrequent where the manner in which legal action is taken against Opposition politicians raises eyebrows. Ruling party members often predict arrests. There is no way politicians can have prior knowledge of arrests if the police act independently and impartially. Nor can they convince the public that there is no political interference in the legal process when former senior police officers, who are card-carrying members of their party, are pulled out of retirement and elevated to top positions in the public security sector.",
    "Prolonged stays in Sri Lanka\u2019s overcrowded remand prisons, which are notorious for their appalling conditions, are tantamount to punishing suspects before they are proven guilty. Extended remand periods severely erode the fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence. It is imperative that no room be left for public suspicion that the government in power manipulates the law with the help of senior officers of the police and other statutory bodies with arrest powers to settle political scores and cripple the Opposition. This is not a baseless allegation or mere conjecture. One of the defining features of Sri Lanka\u2019s deteriorating political culture is the selective enforcement of the law. There are instances where Opposition politicians and their family members are arrested and remanded over illegally assembled vehicles even when they are not the original owners of such contraptions. However, the police routinely hesitate, or outright refuse, to arrest ruling party politicians facing damning allegations such as forgery and illegal acquisition of property.",
    "The culture of impunity is far from over, and only those who are not connected to the ruling party are equal before the law. If political interference in the legal and judicial processes persists, with the promise of a new political culture remaining unfulfilled, come the next regime change, the boot will be on the other foot.",
