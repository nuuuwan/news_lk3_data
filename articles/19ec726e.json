Notably, 120 megawatts of hydropower generation are also set to be integrated into the national power system.",

Approximately 15,500 families stand to benefit from these developments.",
    "Additionally, preparations are underway to supply water to 350 small tanks and 7 medium-sized tanks situated 90 kilometres northwest of the Wa-Madilla Reservoir through the Northwest Canal.

This initiative aims to furnish safe irrigation water and 10 MCM of drinking water to 75,000 families.",
    "Furthermore, a 96-kilometre canal is currently under construction, stretching from the Moragahakanda Reservoir to Hurulu Lake and Mahakanadarava, aimed at transporting irrigation water to the North Central Province. This ambitious project includes a 28-kilometre tunnel. Once completed, it will provide safe water facilities to 2,300 hectares of land and benefit 175,000 families.",
    "Additionally, the canal will have the capacity to supply water to 1,300 small tanks, while also facilitating the provision of 40 MCM (million cubic meters) of drinking water.",
