  "original_body_lines": [
    "Was the same Playbook to unmake Multiculturalism and stage the Palestine Nakba (catastrophe) for the violent birth of Israel in May 1948 used years later in the July 1983 pogrom and staged riots in Sri Lanka? Moreover, were the same foreign institutional forces, clandestine actors and networks involved?",
    "Our Sri Lankan Nakba, which included killings, staged riots, forced migration and brain drain to de-develop the country, inaugurated a 30-year cycle of war. The July 1983 pogrom also served to construct a dominant narrative of a perpetually divided people locked in ethno-religious strife in \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019. This was much like the disinformation spread about Palestine\u2013 a highly multicultural land before the Nakba in which millions were forcibly displaced.",
    "The narrative of \u2018perpetual ethnic conflict\u2019 in Lanka belied centuries of multiculturalism, co-existence and intermarriage across generations among Sinhala and Tamil speaking peoples. So too, was Palestine a multicultural and multi-religious mosaic of Arab, Bedouin, Christian, Druze, Jewish peoples, before organized violence was unleashed to displace non-Jews and birth the settler colonial state of Israel on May 14, 1948.",
    "Israel was born exactly three months after the Crown Colony of Ceylon morphed into a British Dominion on February 14, 1948, with pomp, circumstance and the fa\u00e7ade of Independence. The catastrophe staged for the founding of the Zionist state was backed by the occupying colonial power\u2013Britain and an increasingly powerful American Jewish Diaspora. That history of violence repeats today in Gaza and the West Bank as tragedy and genocide. Sri Lanka, thankfully escaped the fate of divided, partitioned and pounded Palestine\u2014for now at least.",
    "Post July 1983, a dominant narrative of perpetual \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019 between the Sinhala and Tamil speaking communities was funded and constructed largely by the Ford Foundation\u2019s ethnic conflict research industry, headquartered at the International Center for Ethnic Studies in Colombo. The narrative of perpetual conflict between Sinhalas and Tamils re-inscribed local ethno-nationalist and Mahavamsa historiography\u2013 as critique. More often than not, this was inadvertent, but then, the path to hell is often paved with good intentions!",
    "The ethnic conflict research industry was in turn part of Cold War Area Studies grant Programs in the American academy, which were funded by the State Department and USAID, and often included human rights, peace building, trauma and reconciliation, literature and film production. The ethnic turn in the social sciences was buttressed by a lost generation of historians, islanded and trapped in the Anglo-Dutch colonial archive, dependent on European Union grants and producing Raj Nostalgia colonial history. These historians remain largely unable to de-island and re-connect Ceylon/Sri Lanka to Global South and Indian Ocean World history even in the Asian Century.",
    "The perpetual \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019 narrative in Lanka built on spurious colonial racial classifications by biologizing fundamentally cultural (i.e. linguistic difference) among Sinhala and Tamil-speaking people who had co-existed and inter-married for centuries across generations. Crucially, it served to conceal the fact that the armed conflict in the geostrategic island at the center of the Indian Ocean world was really just another Cold War Proxy war, staged between blood brothers and sisters, as ethno-religious identity politics were weaponized by external actors. Hence the title of Harvard Anthropologist, Stanley Tambiah\u2019s book \u201cEthnic Fratricide\u201d.",
    "After the pogrom and staged riots of July 1983, a shadow war was waged across geostrategic Sri Lanka. This, between the India-backed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and the Sri Lankan armed forces whose units were being trained and armed by British MI-6 linked Special Air Services (SAS) officers, of the Keenie Meeni mercenaries (KMS), and Israel\u2019s Mossad.",
    "In short, Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019 was NOT unique. Rather, evolved, waxed and waned as a small piece in the larger global jigsaw puzzle of regional Cold War Proxy Wars roiling much of de-colonizing Asia, Africa and South America, including Palestine.\u00a0 protect the security the economic interests of European empires in retreat and pre-empt genuine de-colonization led by Communist and Leftist forces.",
    "With the wisdom of hindsight and new research into de-classified documents it is now clear that Sri Lanka\u2019s so-called internal \u2018ethnic conflict was really part of a wider Indian Ocean and South Asia Cold War proxy war. As the Cold War between the Capitalist Western allies and the Soviet Socialist and Communist Block led by Russia escalated at the end of World War 2 in Europe, South Asia was drawn into a regional proxy war.",
    "As part of a wider Cold War strategy and the anti-communist global crusade the British and Americans were keen to establish military bases in geostrategic Sri Lanka at the center of the Indian Ocean. However, India, the regional hegemon, being close to the Soviet Union was dead set against UK and US bases being set up in her backyard.",
    "Hence, various Gladio-style \u2018stay behind\u201d clandestine operations were unleashed much as in Europe in Sri Lanka, as in other counties in the Global South, often with deep penetration and infiltration of local authorities and national institutions. This, also to protect Euro-American economic, corporate and security interests in the de-colonizing Global South. These took the form of terror attacks, assassinations, croups against Socialist and Leftist de-colonization and national independence leaders and movements; \u2018false flag\u2019 operations in order to blame and de-legitimize the Left that were also penetrated, as was the case with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramua uprisings and Dirty Wars of 1972 and the late eighties.",
    "As in Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan, India, Rwanda, Burundi, DRCongo, Chile, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Cyprus, the list goes on, tensions among historically multicultural and multi-religious communities were systematically weaponized to greater or lesser degree by mostly Western intelligence agencies and Mossad. This was, of course in collusion with local elites and religious group by weaponing ethno-religious identity politics as part of Cold War proxy wars against the leftist movements and agendas.",
    "The war in Sri Lanka triggered after 13 soldiers were killed in the northern Province of Jaffna 42 years ago on July 23 by a small group of separatists backed by neighbouring India. As the bodies of the soldiers were brought to Colombo for cremation, segments of the JR Jayewardene regime and some Trade Unions infiltrated by foreign intelligence agencies carried out the pogrom.",
    "After the pogrom of July 1983 there were attempts to blame leftists. At the time, Inspector General of Police, Rudra Rajasingham, whose request to impose curfew and preempt the pogrom were denied by JR Jayewardena on the fateful night of July 23, 1983 had questioned the attempt to blame the left for the violence that ensued.",
    "The July 1983 Shock Doctrine in Sri Lanka enabled the entry of British MI-6, Special Air Services (SAS) linked Keenie Meenie mercenaries and Israeli Mossad to establish the desired bases in the Eastern Province. This was purportedly to train Sri Lankan Special Forces (STF) in \u2018counter-terrorism\u2019 and paramilitary operations against India\u2019s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) backed LTTE and other Tamil militant groups. Militarization also served President J.R Jayawardena\u2019s Neo-liberal economic agenda of setting up free trade zones with attenuated Labour Rights.",
    "National and local political and Business Elites in Sri Lanka were well trained to follow the instructions of their former colonial masters, and later their Development Aid \u201cadvisors\u201d, and assist the retreating British Raj to protect its economic and security interests.",
    "The endgame of setting up of foreign bases, cells, networks and \u2018spider webs\u2019 of control within local armed forces and paramilitary units was in sight. Later these would morph into \u201cJakarta Method\u2019 style Dirty War terror and torture house operations against the purportedly Leftist JVP, again with British and Israeli \u2018advisors\u201d. This included the infamous Batalanda and other Torture Camps in Southern Sri Lanka.",
    "Beneath the official narrative of interminable \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019 in Sri Lanka, lurked foreign intelligence agencies, clandestine networks and external forces, skilled in researching ethno-religious identity politics, and weaponizing tensions in historically multicultural societies. This included the use of blackmail and honey traps of political elites, like Sri Lanka\u2019s Ranil Wickremesinghe. Some of this is now being revealed in the Jeffrey Epstine case files.",
    "While the role of India and its intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW),\u00a0 is relatively well known also though the book \u2018Assignment Colombo\u2019 by former Ambassador Dixit, the role of Western intelligence agencies in Sri Lanka\u2019s multiple dirty wars (LTTE and Janatha Vimukthi Peramua JVP vs. the State) is less known.",
    "Parts of that story were revealed in Victor Ostrovsky and Clair Hoy\u2019s book published in Canada in 1990, which became a New York Times bestseller that the Israeli foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, tried to ban. \u201cBy Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer\u201d is the true story of an officer in Israel\u2019s most secret operations, including in Sri Lanka",
    "Other parts of the story of Western Cold War foreign intelligence agency networks involved in Sri Lanka, namely the British colonial office, are revealed in Phil Miller\u2019s book; \u201cKeenie Meenie: the British Mercenaries who got away with war crimes\u201d, and resonate with Vincent Bevin\u2019s \u201cJakarta Method:\u00a0 Washington\u2019s Anti-Communist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program that shaped our World. Israel\u2019s Mossad was a proxy for the US Central Intelligence Agency due to India\u2019s opposition to the US intelligence agency in Sri Lanka.",
    "India, close ally of the Soviet Socialist Block led by Russia (USSR), opposed the setting up of US and British bases in its backyard. Hence the British and Americans went to the Chagos Islands, due southwest of Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands, drove out all its people, who were scattered in Mauritius, Seychelles, and Britain to construct the huge Diego Garcia military base in the early sixties. The British called the Chagos Islands British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).",
    "Ostrovsky\u2019s revelations about how Mossad trained both the Sri Lanka Special forces (STF), and LTTE, and sold weapons to both have been corroborated by new research on declassified documents, as well as, local sources. These include Phil Miller\u2019s work and Herman Guneratne\u2019s book \u2018For a Sovereign State\u201d. Remarkably, Ostrovsky quoted Penny Jayewardene, wife of Ravi Jayawardena, the son of President JR Jayewardene who was involved in setting up of the Special Task Force (STF) -Mossad-KMS- training camps on how World Bank Funds that were earmarked for the Mahaweli Development Project were diverted for covert operations and the setting up training bases in the Eastern Province.",
    "Retrospectively it is clear that Ostrovsky\u2019s revelations about Mossad activities in Sri Lanka were buried in a Cover Up Investigation and Commission Report conducted by SWP Wadugodapitiya, PC. The Report dated September 1991, into Mossad\u2019s activities on Sri Lanka was commissioned by President R Premadasa, who subsequently ordered the exit from Sri Lanka and closure of all foreign military bases, including Mossad and the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), which controlled the northeast of Sri Lanka between July 1987 and March 1990.",
    "President Premadasa who had also accused Mossad of instigating an impeachment motion against him was assassinated on May 1, 1993. As usual the LTTE was blamed but this does not add up since Premadasa had sought the help of the LTTE to get rid of the Indian Forces.",
    "Taken together, it is apparent that the geopolitical Endgame of foreign forces operating in Sri Lanka staging armed conflicts (both the LTTE ethnic proxy war which later split and morphed into the Southern JVP Dirty War violence of 1989-90), were the establishment of foreign military bases, then as now in the geostrategic island at the center of the Indian Ocean world.",
    "The Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project in the Eastern Province was re-designed also to serve as an entry point for Mossad and the British intelligence MI-6 linked Keenie Meenie mercenaries to enable \u2018training bases\u2019 once pro-US JR Jayewardene (Yankie Dickie was his nickname), came to power in 1977, unseating the Socialist and Non-Aligned Sirima Bandaranaike regime. Some of this is detailed in revealing pages by Ostrovsky.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s internal war was also punctuated by international peace building efforts. The wars seemed to wax and wane with Cold War developments in Europe and Indian external and domestic (Tamil Nadu) interests, in tandem with internal political developments and the interests of local actors. This is true of both the LTTE ethnic proxy war and the Southern JVP Dirty War violence of 1989-90, in which many of the same actors were involved. After the IPKF arrived in Sri Lanka in with the signing of the Indian Peace Keeping Accords in July 1987, and took over the Northeast Province, the Mossad, British KMS Advisors and STF moved out of the East to Southern Sri Lanka where they set up camp for Dirty War, counter-terrorism and torture house operations that ensured 1988-1993.",
    "Indeed, the late 80 and early 90s period of assassinations and Dirty War operations involving the leftist Janatha Vimukti Peramuna echo US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) \u2018Jakarta Method\u2019 operations detailed by Vincent Bevins\u2019 in his \u201cThe Jakarta Method: Washington\u2019s Anti-Communist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program that Shaped our World\u201d, published in 2020. It was common knowledge in Colombo circles that the Israelis worked out of a Special Interest Section in the United States Embassy as Sri Lanka had not recognized the existence of the State of Israel, being Non-Aligned and sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.",
    "The coveted Trincomalee Deep Sea Harbor in the Eastern Province to surveil and control Indian Ocean trade, energy and now submarine data cable routes was clearly a prime target of and for Western and Indian intervention. The British and French, not to mention the Portuguese and Dutch had in earlier centuries fought bloody battles to capture and control the Maritime Provinces of Ceylon.",
    "In these times a new scandal involving Israeli \u2018tourists\u2019 running Chabard \u2013Lubovitch Prayer Houses in the Eastern Province which was also mysteriously targeted by an Islamic State (ISIS) attack on Easter Sunday 2019 have emerged."
