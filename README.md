A plot to assassinate Pope Francis during a trip to Iraq was stopped following a tip-off from British intelligence, according to his upcoming autobiography.

The Pope writes that, after landing in Baghdad in March 2021, he was told an event at which he was set to appear was being targeted by two suicide bombers.

The visit, which took place over three days during the coronavirus pandemic, was the first ever to Iraq by a pope and saw an intense security operation.

### Syrian mass graves expose тАЬmachinery of deathтАЭ under Assad, top prosecutor says

*2024-12-18 07:38:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104318/syrian-mass-graves-expose-machinery-of-death-under-assad-top-prosecutor-says) ┬╖ `en`

An international war crimes prosecutor said on Tuesday that evidence emerging from mass grave sites in Syria has exposed a state-run тАЬmachinery of deathтАЭ under toppled leader Bashar al-Assad in which he estimated more than 100,000 people were tortured and murdered since 2013.

Speaking after visiting two mass grave sites in the towns of Qutayfah and Najha near Damascus, former U.S. war crimes ambassador at large Stephen Rapp told Reuters: тАЬWe certainly have more than 100,000 people that were disappeared into and tortured to death in this machine.

тАЬI donтАЩt have much doubt about those kinds of numbers given what weтАЩve seen in these mass graves.тАЭ

тАЬWe really havenтАЩt seen anything quite like this since the Nazis,тАЭ said Rapp, who led prosecutions at the Rwanda and Sierra Leone war crimes tribunals and is working with Syrian civil society to document war crimes evidence and is helping to prepare for any eventual trials.

If the current Government is truly committed to providing social welfare and addressing the needs of the people suffering the most, it must avoid future borrowings in the capital markets

Following is a statement by Yukthi, calling for economic policies that lead to a process of sustainable development that uplifts working people. It opposes a return to high-interest international capital markets, which have already created an intolerable burden for the people

On 13 December 2024, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance announced the тАЬsuccessful expiration of its consent solicitation and exchange offer related to its international sovereign bonds.тАЭ The initial proposal for a deal had been concluded during a blackout period two days before the Presidential election that was held on 21 September 2024.

Who deprived the equal rights of Tamils? Not the Sinhalese but the Vellala Tamils themselves

Capt. (Rtd) Rajaratne has written the above article, appeared in Daily FT on 6 December 2024 (https://www.ft.lk/columns/National-security-only-through-national-harmony/4-770154).

Rajaratne implies that the Tamils are subjected to inequality, injustice, oppression, marginalisation, and deprivation. The commemoration of the dead LTTE cadre in the north, he says, was a stark indictment of the failures of the successive Governments to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, liberation, inclusivity, and opportunity.

The above article, in its entirety, is an attempt to convince the reader that Tamils in Sri Lanka are discriminated against and their grievances are not addressed properly. The above implication, which is far from truth, is exactly what the separatists want the world to know to justify their claim for a federal/independent state.

Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya told Parliament yesterday (17) that the injustice inflicted on religious traditions and mothers could never be justified by cremation of the victims of the infection.

The resolution of the last government is not in any way justified. It is a resolution of the most sensitive and most cruel. The family is able to express their grief and reduce grief through the customs that are fulfilled after a death. That is why it has been given religious values.

Such traditions are very important in the uncertainty like the Kovit infection. In this case, such a terrible decision cannot be allowed in any way. Politics or any other reason for that is not valid. It is unreasonable to make such a decision without scientific basis. Therefore, our government will never make any resolution that will cause such suffering to any sect or to insult religious traditions.
