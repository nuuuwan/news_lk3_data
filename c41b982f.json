    "State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon has assured that despite the withdrawal of army personnel from Mihintale, there is no threat to the security of the sacred site.",
    "Responding to a claim raised by MP Roshan Ranasinghe in Parliament this morning (11 Dec.), the State Minister noted that all 252 army personnel stationed at Mihintale were not there for security purposes, and thus, their withdrawal has no effect on the security of the sacred site.",
    "\u201cThere is no security threat as a result of the withdrawal of all 252 personnel. They were not placed there for security purposes. Security is being provided by Sri Lanka Police, and there are over 30 police personnel present at the site\u201d, Tennakoon said, adding that while the security of Mihintale is a responsibility undertaken by the Sri Lanka Police, personnel from the other defence forces including the army will be deployed if necessary.",
    "Speaking in Parliament this morning, former Sports Minister MP Roshan Ranasinghe had raised concerns that due to the removal of army personnel from Mihintale, all development activities that were underway have come to a standstill."
