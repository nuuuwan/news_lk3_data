    "Sri Lanka won the duel between the two World Cup qualifiers on Sunday thrashing the Netherlands by 128 runs in the final of the tournament in Harare.",
    "The Dutch did well to skittle the Sri Lankans out for just 233 inside 48 overs after Dutch captain Scott Edwards won the toss and put them into bat.",
    "However, the Dutch were never in the hunt after being reduced to 39-3 -- man of the match Dilshan Madushanka taking three of the wickets -- as they collapsed to 105 all out in just over 23 overs.",
    "Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood was beaming after his side achieved all the targets set for them.",
    "The 48-year-old Englishman said the confidence gained from the tournament would serve them well for the sport's quadrennial showpiece which gets underway in India on October 5.",
    "\u201cSecond was winning the tournament and we have fortunately done that as well. We can go home happy.",

    "Madushanka's devastating spell had the Dutch reeling and opener Max O'Dowd had to watch from the other end as his partners came and went at regular intervals.",
    "O'Dowd eventually went for a doughty 33 off 63 balls clean bowled by Maheesh Theekshana -- who cleaned up the tail and finished with 4-31.\u00a0(Pix: ICC)"
