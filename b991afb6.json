    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament passed a controversial new central bank law which the opposition slammed for lack of accountability in a country where there is growing understanding of the inevitable effects of central bank rate cuts enforced by inflationary open market operations.",
    "The law passed with 66 legislators voting for and 23 voting against in a partially empty house where the debate was disrupted earlier in the day amid protests that there was no quorum.",
    "\u201cThe intention of the new law is to correct past mistakes,\u201d State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said.",
    "The opposition called for amendments to make the central bank which has a history of printing money through various liquidity tools for macro-economic policy.",
    "Countries with bad money central banks run on so-called Keynesian policies end up in the arms of the International Monetary Fund again and again, while their currencies depreciate permanently due to conflicting aims and goals.",
    "The passage of the controversial law is a requirement under the 17th IMF program that the flexible exchange rate central bank dragged the country into.",
    "The opposition slammed the law for giving independence to the agency without proper accountability provisions.",
    "\u201cI am not at ease with this bill, because I feel we have come back to the same place again,\u201d opposition legislator Kabir Hashim said.",
    "\u201cThe central bank still has along with its primary objectives of price stability, contradictory, output gap targeting, exchange rate determination, policy rate determination, and inflation targeting.",
    "Output gap targeting or active macro-economic policy involves printing money for growth or cutting policy rates using inflationary open market operations.",
    "The IMF itself taught the country to calculate a potential output, dangling a goal for the central bank to print money to reach it.",
    "Countries with bad money central banks with contradictory money and exchange policies continue to have exchange and trade controls, social unrest and repeated IMF programs.",
    "Flexible inflation targeting and similar regimes with different labels (targeting a domestic anchor while trying to collect reserves) especially with a high inflation targeting is found in defaulting countries with external instability including Ghana and Argentina.",
    "Hashim said as far back as 1966, former President J R Jayewardene (before he became President) had engaged B R Shenoy to come up with solutions when the country ran into forex problems in 1966.",
    "Sri Lanka had two back to back IMF programs \u2013 with the second starting before the first one ended \u2013 in that period. Shenoy had advocated a clean float.",
    "In 1980 when Jayewardene liberalized the economy, the central bank was again printing money and Goh Keng Swee had and advised him not to allow the central bank to print money.",
    "He also warned there was no benefit in depreciating the currency.",
    "Singapore does not have a policy rate and operates on currency board principles.",
    "The law has a provision which legitimizes printing money to reach a potential output, or active macroeconomic policy while having exchange rate policy and reserve management objectives.",
    "Opposition legislator Harsha de Silva said the law was a step in the right direction, but amendments were needed and hoped the government would accept them.",
    "The central bank will continue to print money for provisional advances for the government with an amendment that they would be printed at market rates, raising the question why the money was not raised from the market in the first place instead of being printed to blow the balance of payments apart as in the past.",
    "Hashim told parliament that several East Asian countries showed during the Pandemic that it was possible to raise real money and even cut taxes, while countries that started Covid re-finance funds including Nigeria and Pakistan had ended up in crises, not to mention Sri Lanka.",
    "Accountability in the new law was weak or non-existent, opposition legislators warned.",
    "Related Sri Lanka legislators slam new IMF backed central bank law for lack of accountability",
    "\u201cThe central bank can continue to create instability as in the past mis-using certain clauses and powers in the bill,\u201d Hashim warned.",
    "\u201cThere are no penalties for central bankers who fail to meet inflation targets set by parliament.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey are allowed to make people poor overnight through inflation and go Scott free. \u00a0(Colombo/July20/2023)"
