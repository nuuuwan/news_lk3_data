    "The Women\u2019s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) Northern Chapter, formally inaugurated earlier this year, has been operating in the Northern Province with the support of the German Asia-Pacific Business Association (OAV) for the past two years, engaging, empowering, and enriching the women entrepreneurs of the North.",
    "Northern Province, once a vibrant hub of economic activity, is making valiant efforts to gain the lost glory. However, the results are much to be desired.",
    "The WCIC has enrolled a base of SMEs and some larger businesses to form a group that could benefit from the efforts and strengths of the chamber. We focus on providing capacity building initiatives and support with policy advocacy.",
    "A Full day workshop was conducted on 23 July, at the Mangalam \u2013 Hotel Thinnai under the topic \u201cImportance of Packaging\u201d. The program was a joint initiative by the WCIC and the UNIDO. UNIDO supported by providing the expert packaging consultant Abhaya Senevirathne. Due to the high demand, it was extended to all entrepreneurs without gender restrictions",
    "Speaking on behalf of the WCIC, Board member Tusitha Kumarakulasignam and CEO Chitranjali Dissanayake stated, \u201cWe have conducted a need-analysis of the women entrepreneurs in the North and this topic is marked as important in the list. Therefore, we collaborated with UNIDO to conduct a joint program. The participants have evaluated the learning as extremely valuable for their businesses.\u201d",
    "The Northern Province Governor Nagalingam Vedanayagam attended the program and commended the WCIC and UNIDO for organising the workshop.",
    "The many businesses represented had little or no technical knowledge related to the importance of using the most optimal, appropriate packaging for products. They were able to review their current usage and consider if improvement was necessary. Importance of ideal packaging from the point of view of safety, protection, transport as well as visual merchandising was discussed.",
    "Pamela Sumithrarachchi and Sumathy Rajasingam representing UNIDO joined the WCIC team to ensure the success of the workshop.",
    "Women\u2019s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) is the National Chamber of Sri Lanka and the premier organisation supporting women entrepreneurs and professional businesswomen. The membership is open to women who believe they can contribute to society as well as benefit from the many facilities the organisation creates. WCIC Northern Chapter will be dedicated to provide direct support to all the women entrepreneurs in the North to enhance their contribution to the Sri Lankan economy."
