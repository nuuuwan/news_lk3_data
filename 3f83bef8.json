    "The outpatient department of Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) in Colombo has launched a 24-hour token strike from 8.00 a.m. today (July 19).",
    "Speaking on the matter, the spokesperson of the Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA) Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe mentioned that the strike was initiated in protest of the \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and \u2018unprofessional\u2019 conduct of a female specialist doctor at the hospital, which had remained a long-standing issue.",
    "Dr. Wijesinghe said the hospital\u2019s director has failed to resolve the matter by taking action against the specialist doctor in question despite the repeated complaints made by other medical officers against her.",
    "This compelled the association to bring the matter to the attention of Director-General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Asela Gunawardena, however, he too has failed to fulfill his promise to resolve the issue within seven days although three weeks have already passed, the GMOA spokesperson continued.",
    "Accordingly, a 24-hour token strike was initiated by the hospital\u2019s outpatient department, however, emergency treatments will be carried on regardless of the trade union action, the GMOA spokesperson said further.",
    "Speaking to Ada Derana, LHR Director Dr. G. Wijesuriya said he was not officially informed of the token strike taking place today. \u201cI am aware of it [the token strike]. But I was not informed.\u201d",
    "The hospital chief admitted that the conduct of the specialist doctor has remained an issue for some time as she is known for her rude attitude. He, however, noted that the doctors on strike do not work under the said specialist doctor.",
    "\u201cSteps have been taken to stop admitting patients to the ward, where the said specialist doctor is attached to. There is nothing else I can do beyond that. In any case, I have no authority to remove or transfer a doctor appointed by the Public Service Commission.\u201d"
