Anura bothered about his mother seeing his school report before he did

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar, by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

In 1960, as she rode to power, after a grueling campaign, as the world’s first-ever woman prime minister, Sirima Bandaranaike was making the global headlines and taking Ceylon too into the limelight, which was to last for decades. The world wondered as to how this phenomenon, of a woman being chosen to be prime minister, had occurred in Ceylon. Was it some peculiar provision of dynastic succession by which the wife succeeded to a vacancy caused by the death of a husband Could such a thing occur only in an Asian country? Was it, as uncharitable political opponents would say, a consequence of the enormous wave of sympathy that followed close on the tragic death of a popular leader? Was the phenomenon connected mystically with the primacy of motherhood’ (matar) so central a part of the culture of the Indian subcontinent?

### The Silence of the Speaker and other matters

*2024-12-16 11:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-silence-of-the-speaker-and-other-matters/) · `en`

It is more than two weeks since the matter of the Speaker, Asoka Ranwala’s doctorate, or lack of it, was raised in public. If he does have one, it is sufficient time for him to have produced the necessary evidence and laid to rest the ongoing speculation. When my daughter acquired a doctorate from a university in England, she was ceremoniously presented with an ornately inscribed scroll, on thick, parchment paper , along with a foolish hat.

To me, a non-academic, it seemed a paltry outcome for the several years of intense study which preceded the award but that, apparently, is how these systems work. Perhaps Waseda University of Japan, the institution alleged to have conferred the doctoral degree on Ranwala, does not emulate old-fashioned British institutions, but there still needs to be tangible, physical evidence of such an award, with which Ranwala came away from that institution.

ECONOMYNEXT – Germany is facing increased shortages in the labour market and is looking at India to fill that vacuum.

While the shortage is mostly in the healthcare, IT, and engineering sectors, the country is seeing an increased need for skilled workers in other trades too.

One initiative to address the shortage in the healthcare sector was the direct agreement signed between Germany and the State government of Kerala for the recruitment of nurses.

That success may lead to similar collaborations with other State governments such as Madya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

Germany is also fast becoming the country of choice for Indians pursuing higher studies.

Recent reports indicate that nearly 12.3 per cent (43, 000) of the international student body in Germany comprises Indians. They have now replaced Chinese students as the frontrunners.

🟩

During the last presidential election, there were various comments about the government's obtaining loans. However, some argue that the government is getting more debts. Some people respond that the government receives loans is acceptable. In this case, there are conflicting claims that the loans received in this position are to address the deficit of the budget, or to repay the loans we have already received.. Factcheck.lk clarifies three key questions about the Sri Lankan government's obtaining loans.

Governments get loans for three main reasons. First to make the main financial deficit. To pay off the second loans and interest. Third to pay maturity loans.

If the government is considering these three reasons for one thing, it is the total value of the debt that the government has to obtain every year. This is what we call the GFN (Gross Financing Need) total financial service.

Question - 02: 2024 How much did the government borrow?

It would be “very difficult to reach a final count” given that most residents are Muslim, traditionally burying their dead within 24 hours, Bieuville added.

### Education reforms should reckon matters if connected to market by generating creative capital

*2024-12-16 02:43:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Education-reforms-should-reckon-matters-if-connected-to-market-by-generating-creative-capital/4-770549) · `en`

What is observed in the school system in Sri Lanka is, instead of encouraging students to question, they are trained to observe and uphold conformity

The purpose of education should be to develop creative capital and not mere human capital as has been traditionally emphasised. Such creative capital should be global in outlook rather than national or territorial. They are today known as global citizens. The foundation for creating such global citizens should be laid from the very beginning of a student starting his education at the school level and continued through his tertiary education at universities. The role of the Government is to create the necessary environment conducive for citizens to become such creative people. This is what PM should do in her education reforms

The International Institute of Health Sciences (IIHS) has introduced several new degree courses aimed at a number of health professionals, including nurses and midwives. Through these programmes, professionals will get the opportunity to acquire locally and internationally recognised knowledge and skills.

A key example of IIHS’s commitment to empowering healthcare professionals is the introduction of the degree programme for Public Health and Midwifery.

Takshila Jayakody, a midwife said that providing care for pregnant patients and offering assistance during delivery and the postpartum period is an important role. Gaining professional qualifications in the field will make midwifery a viable career path for us in Sri Lanka and abroad. We had only studied midwifery at diploma level. But now, we can study up to the degree level. The programmes at IIHS give us the opportunity to gain international-level knowledge, which in turn allows us to provide superior service to our community.”

*2024-12-16 01:03:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lankas-industrial-production-increased-by-7-in-october-2024/) · `en`

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in October 2024 increased by 7.0 per cent to 95.5 compared to October 2023, mainly contributed by the increases reported in the manufacture of Coke and refined petroleum products (38.6 per cent), Wearing apparel (7.8 per cent) and Beverages (27.6 per cent), according to the Weekly Economic Indicators report of the Central Bank.

“Between December 09th and 13th, 2024, crude oil prices generally trended upward driven by escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, expectations of increased demand from China, and the European Union’s decision to impose additional sanctions on Russia. However, prices slightly dipped towards the end of the period, influenced by the International Energy Agency’s forecast of ample supply. Overall, Brent and WTI prices increased by US dollars 1.91 and US dollars 2.42 per barrel, respectively, during this timeframe, it noted.

### As Dissanayake visits, India must embrace Sri Lanka’s new dawn

This week, Modi will learn that under AKD’s tenure, Sri Lanka too will seek to strike the right balance of partnerships between India, China and other global powers, in a manner that is ultimately calibrated towards the best long-term interests of Sri Lanka. Dissanayake has the savvy to appreciate the importance of maintaining strong ties with India, but is extremely unlikely to compromise his principles in doing so

One side-effect of the polarising effect of nationalism and populism around the world in recent years has been a decrease in the political stability and mandate enjoyed by incumbent regimes. From the erosion of nationalist hegemony in Malaysia or India to the rise of populism in the United States and pockets of Europe, swings in both directions have led to fragile coalitions, divided legislatures and a rise in uncertainty.

### Maintaining cohesiveness within NPP

*2024-12-15 23:46:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Maintainingcohesiveness-within-NPP/4-770536) · `en`

How will the NPP inculcate their preference and behaviour among the new faces in the Parliament?

Every single member in the party must understand and absorb the vision of the leadership of the NPP. The stated vision must be transparent and explicit. It must not provide loopholes for a cynic to implicitly translate unfavourably. They all must share the same vision as that of the leadership. Once this is established they are able to formulate the missions that are relevant for their own territories of work

Many of our previous Governments of recent times fell into major problems since the leadership lost control of its party members. The problem was further compounded since quite a few of them were coalition governments. The NPP is a single party government with enormous power. Yet NPP can’t afford to remain complacent.

### Increasing tax revenue without hiking tax burden

*2024-12-15 23:38:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Increasing-tax-revenue-without-hiking-tax-burden/4-770535) · `en`

Taxes are certainly essential to fund public services and infrastructure, but a disproportionately high tax burden can backfire

No one willingly parts what they own, unless the return is of equal or greater value, regardless of its tangibility – and this applies to taxes as well. The million-dollar question for Sri Lankan taxpayers is: what do we really get in return for the taxes we pay?

Despite the Government’s efforts to promote taxation as a civic duty, flawed tax policies are undermining public trust. The fundamental principle of taxation is fairness, which means taxation should be based on ability to pay.

However, the previous Government’s decision to reduce VAT and income tax thresholds and to increase their tax rates, amid inflation that has risen from 9% to an unprecedented 70% in 2022, was anything but prudent. Such a move contradicted the fundamental principle of easing the tax burden during an economic downturn.

### Critique on Engineering Council of Sri Lanka, its Act and conduct

The circular sought to compel all engineers, including those with foreign qualifications or specialised knowledge in fields not recognised by IESL or IIESL, to conform to the ECSL’s registration requirements

The absence of a properly defined hierarchy among engineering practitioners – one that accounts for both academic qualifications and practical experience – created confusion and uncertainty within the profession. It was argued that any attempt to regulate engineers without first establishing such a hierarchy was both arbitrary and irrational. This argument underscores the ECSL’s lack of preparedness and its failure to establish a coherent regulatory framework before issuing far-reaching directives through the circular
