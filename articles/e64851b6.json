  "original_body_lines": [
    "King Charles has commended President Trump\u2019s personal commitment to \u201cfinding solutions to some of the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts\u201d, as he called for US support for Ukraine against \u201ctyranny\u201d, in a speech at the US state visit banquet.",
    "In response, President Trump hailed the special relationship between the US and the UK, saying the word \u201cspecial does not begin to do it justice\u201d.",
    "The King\u2019s speech, at a lavish dinner for 160 guests in Windsor Castle, emphasised the deep connections between the two countries and the need to maintain cultural, trading and military links.",
    "\u201cOur people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear,\u201d said the King.",
    "The state visit will continue on Thursday, including Queen Camilla and the Princess of Wales at events with the First Lady Melania Trump.",
    "It will move from a royal spectacle to political talks and a news conference, as Trump travels to meet Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his country house, Chequers.",
    "The state banquet on Wednesday came at the end of a day of pageantry and politics, where the president was welcomed to Windsor by the King, Queen and a line-up of senior royals.",
    "When they arrived, President and Melania Trump stepped out of ornate carriages inside the castle\u2019s scenic quadrangle, before an inspection of troops on perfectly-prepared lawns.",
    "The Prince and Princess of Wales were also there to welcome the US visitor in this royal charm offensive, holding a \u201cwarm and friendly\u201d private meeting with President and Melania Trump.",
    "In his banquet speech, the president praised Prince William saying he would be an \u201cunbelievable success in the future\u201d and called Catherine \u201cradiant and so healthy and so beautiful\u201d.",
    "Trump\u2019s historic second state visit showed a good relationship between the King and president, including some friendly moments as they watched the ceremonial parade.",
    "The King jokingly seemed to be warning the president to watch out for the sword of one of the soldiers on parade.",
    "President Trump showed great interest when he was shown around St George\u2019s Chapel, saying: \u201cWhat a place, what a place\u201d and looking at the Royal Collection\u2019s historic documents about US independence, he commented: \u201cThe real deal.\u201d",
    "The president has been a long-time admirer of the late Queen Elizabeth and he laid a wreath and paid his respects at her tomb in Windsor.",
    "And official gifts were exchanged, including giving the visting president the flag that was flying over Buckingham Palace on the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2025.",
    "State visits are a form of soft power diplomacy, using royal hospitality to build relations with important international partners - with none more important than the US.",
    "That includes business links, with more heads of technology firms at the state banquet than celebrities, such as Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Sam Altman of the artificial intelligence firm, OpenAI.",
    "Alongside the state visit, there had been \u00a3150bn of US investment announced into the UK, including \u00a322bn from Microsoft.",
    "Press baron Rupert Murdoch was at the banquet, sitting next to the prime minister\u2019s adviser Morgan McSweeney, at the dinner where guests were given a main course of Norfolk organic chicken.",
    "As well as hailing the value of the US and UK\u2019s partnership, the King stressed the importance of protecting the environment, saying there was a \u201cprecious opportunity to safeguard and to restore the wonders and beauty of nature for the generations who follow us\u201d.",
    "The banquet concluded a day of events intended to make a positive impression on the president, in a shock-and-awe display of pageantry.",
    "With 1,300 service men and women from the Army, Royal Navy and RAF taking part, this was the largest ever guard of honour planned for a state visit to the UK.",
    "The much bigger than usual military line-up for the state visit was the UK government\u2019s message to encourage the US to maintain its commitment to Nato and support Ukraine.",
    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer joined Trump to watch a flypast by the Red Arrows over Windsor, although a planned flypast by F-35 fighter jets was stopped by poor weather conditions.",
    "The royal spectacle seemed to have appealed to the president, who described his state visit as one of the \u201chighest honours\u201d of his life.",
    "But unlike other recent state visits, there were no moments visible to the public, with all the events taking place behind the walls of the Windsor estate or at the PM\u2019s country estate, Chequers.",
    "A protest against the visit was held in London, but there were also anti-Trump placards in Windsor, out of sight from the US visitors.",
    "Protesters included the anti-monarchy group Republic, whose chief executive, Graham Smith said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to fix our democracy and defend the country from those who might want to undermine what democratic rights we have, whether that be Charles or Trump.\u201d"
