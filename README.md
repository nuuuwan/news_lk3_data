Albania’s leader said Friday his new cabinet will include an artificial intelligence “minister” that will be in charge of running public funding projects and fighting corruption in public tenders.

Prime Minister Edi Rama said Diella, whose name means “Sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence.”

Rama said Diella would help ensure that “public tenders will be 100% free of corruption.”

Diella was launched earlier this year as a virtual assistant on the e-Albania public service platform, where she helps users navigate the site while wearing traditional Albanian folk costume.

Rama’s Socialist Party secured a fourth consecutive term after winning 83 of the 140 Assembly seats in the May 11 parliamentary elections. The party can govern alone and pass most legislation, but it needs a two-thirds majority, or 93 seats, to change the Constitution.
