  "original_body_lines": [
    "(Washington, USA) The death of Jimmy Carter has brought to the fore a defining characteristic of the late US president\u2019s life: his \u201cdecency,\u201d seen as a product of a bygone era in today\u2019s caustic political",
    "Joe Biden on Monday repeated the word three times while speaking to reporters about his late White House predecessor.",
    "Biden, who will be replaced in the White House by Donald Trump on January 20, added: \u201cCan you imagine Jimmy Carter referring to someone by the way they look or the way they talk?\u201d",
    "Despite the struggles he faced during his single term in office \u2014 from economic malaise to the Iran hostage crisis \u2014 Carter has emerged as a nostalgic figure.",
    "He spent his years after the White House advocating for global democracy, fighting neglected public health scourges and teaching Sunday school.",
    "\u201cHe was an utterly honest, transparent and healing presence in the White House, which was just what the US needed after the Watergate scandal\u201d under Richard Nixon, Barbara Perry, a professor specializing in the history of US presidents, told AFP.",
    "Eulogies \u201ctell us as much about ourselves as they do about the person being contemplated and commemorated,\u201d historian Jon Meacham told broadcaster MSNBC.",
    "\u201cCarter is a sad but illuminating instance of someone who \u2014 while imperfect \u2014 believed in the centrality of character\u2026 at a moment in American politics where character is not at the forefront of most people\u2019s minds.\u201d",
    "Born in rural Plains, Georgia, he died in the same house he and his wife \u2014 who he was married to for 77 years \u2014 bought in 1961.",
    "And his modest lifestyle served as an inspiration to many Americans \u2014 even if other presidents didn\u2019t join in themselves.",
    "To name a few: allegations of John F. Kennedy\u2019s extramarital trysts, Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with a White House intern, and Donald Trump\u2019s well-documented sex scandals have \u201clowered all such standards in American politics,\u201d Perry said.",
    "\u201cAmericans have become immune to ethical standards in political life.\u201d",
    "Even those who have stayed clean from personal scandal, such as Barack Obama or George W. Bush, have little in common with the modest lifestyle and outspoken advocacy of Carter\u2019s post-presidency.",
    "Carter has received an outpouring of condolences upon his death at age 100 on Sunday.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a stark reminder of how few people there are now with honesty and integrity,\u201d Jay Landers, visiting Plains on Monday, told an AFP reporter.",
    "The former \u2014 and now incoming \u2014 Republican president has been found liable for sexual assault, once mocked a reporter with a physical disability and infamously bragged about groping women by the genitals.",
    "Yet he returns to power in large part due to the conservative and religious right.",
    "Carter\u2019s relationship with Christianity, meanwhile, points toward a different era.",
    "Carter, a Democrat, was an evangelical \u2014 a denomination now associated with the country\u2019s right wing.",
    "The Sunday school teacher also won swaths of the south \u2014 a bastion today of religious conservatism and Republican politics.",
    "Conservative Republican Senator Chuck Grassley noted Carter\u2019s faith on Sunday when he said that, though they were \u201cbit\u201d by a \u201cdifferent political bug,\u201d they had much in common, including \u201clove of the Lord.\u201d",
    "The fractious divides that Carter seems to have transcended, however, have long existed.",
    "Carter himself warned of the nation\u2019s \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in a 1979 speech, sapping \u201cthe very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.\u201d",
    "His warnings sound like they could have been issued about modern political life, telling Americans they were \u201cat a turning point in our history.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation,\u201d he said.",
    "That path, he warned, \u201cleads to fragmentation and self-interest\u2026 It is a certain route to failure.\u201d (AFP/Dec31/2024)"
