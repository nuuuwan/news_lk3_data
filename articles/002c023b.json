    "Union Assurance\u2019s CSR programme,\u00a0Suwamaga, has positively impacted over 10,000 lives across Sri Lanka in just 90 days. Launched with the aim of addressing the rising prevalence of diabetes, the initiative focuses on raising awareness, promoting healthier lifestyles, supporting early detection, and fostering community engagement.",
    "A key aspect of\u00a0Suwamaga\u00a0is the free diabetes testing services offered to the public, regardless of whether they are Union Assurance customers. These screenings, conducted at various events across the country, have enabled many individuals to detect diabetes early, with some referred for immediate medical care. Participants receive a diabetes screening report and medical advice, empowering them to take control of their health.",
    "Chief Marketing Officer, Mahen Gunarathna, emphasized the growing health crisis posed by diabetes in Sri Lanka, citing research that indicates a high prevalence of 9.8% among adults. He noted that the programme aims not only to raise awareness but also to provide accessible healthcare services, eliminating financial barriers to screenings.",
    "By empowering individuals with crucial health information,\u00a0Suwamaga\u00a0is contributing to improving public health and helping prevent the severe consequences of unmanaged diabetes, such as cardiovascular diseases and kidney failure.",
