    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Department of Agriculture has dispatched 75,000 kg of big onion bulbs from Dambulla to Nuwara Eliya to be vernalized for planting in the 2024 yala (minor) season.",
    "The Department expects this batch to yield 7,500 kg of seeds which will be planted over 2,500 hectares, it said in a statement on the Government Department of Information.",
    "\u201cThis vernalization process is essential to produce more flowers from the bulbs to produce big onion seedlings. Bulbs should be stored for about 3 weeks at a temperature of 10-15 degrees centigrade before planting.\u201d",
    "Vernalization is a process which exposes a plant to cold temperatures to induce early flowering. This shortens the vegetative phase of the plant and increases the yield. It also increases the resistance of plants to cold temperatures and diseases. This method is used in plants like onions, wheat, cabbage, beets and turnips.",
    "3,500 hectares of onions were planted in the 2023 yala season, but crops were destroyed by unusually heavy rains before harvesting, the Department of Agriculture said.",
    "Big onion prices rose sharply this month in Sri Lanka after India announced that it would be halting big onion exports until March 31, 2024, in a bid to curb surging prices in their local market.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe had earlier extended a Special Commodity Levy (SCL) for a raft of products including big onion, yogurt, butter, apples, oranges, and some fish from December 1. (Colombo/Dec28/2023)"
