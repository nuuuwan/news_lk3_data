    "\u201cI have received a spate of grievances from several doctors working with the female doctor over her conduct. Some of these doctors are co-workers, while other doctors represent medical associations,\u201d he stated.",
    "\u201cAccordingly, I have informed this regard to the Health\u00a0 Ministry and it has launched an investigation,\u201d Dr G. Wijesuriya mentioned.",
    "He also noted that the doctors working with the alleged consultant on the 8B ward have abstained from reporting to duty. \u201cThis is in fact unfair to the children being treated at the ward,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThus, I humbly request them to report to work with immediate effect; otherwise the lives of the children will be at stake,\u201d Dr\u00a0 G. Wijesuriya added.",
    "Meanwhile, Media Spokesman for the Government Medical\u00a0 Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA) Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe told Daily Mirror that, \u201cThis is not the first time that complaints have been received against the consultant in question. There have been previous occasions\u00a0 where she was in hot water,\u201d",
    "\u201cNow, the matter seems to have been aggravated as no concrete action was taken on previous instances,\u201d he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
