    "\u201cWe are hopeful that the law, the new structure, will be ready in the next year,\u201d Minister Wijesekara told reporters on March 07.",

    "Sri Lanka should have procedures on how to dispose of nuclear waste and handle emergencies.",
    "There are certain criteria that we need to fulfil,\u201d Minister Wijesekera said.  \u201cSo, we are in the process of doing that. So that we are able to handle nuclear waste, how we are going to dispose of it. In case of an emergency how we are going to handle it.",
    "Countries such as Russia, France and the United States had offered to help Sri Lanka with nuclear power, Wijesekera told parliament in November, but a legal framework was needed before calling for expressions of interest.",
    "Sri Lanka has received cabinet approval to call for Expressions of Interest from suitable investors, he said.",
    "In addition to having a nuclear framework ready Sri Lanka also lacked the skills to evaluate technologies.",
    "\u201cThe other assistance we require from global agencies is not just the framework, but evaluating the best technology and best project for Sri Lanka. Because we do not have that experience yet,\u201d Minister Wijeskera said.",
    "\u201cThat is why we have requested the support of development agencies, and other agencies for their support to evaluate these.\u201d",
    "By starting the processes in parallel, Sri Lanka can speed up the process, he said.",
    "A nuclear power plant will take a minimum of 3 to 4 years to build, with some countries taking up to 14 to 15 years.",
    "It is the government policy to have nuclear energy to be part of the energy mix, he said.",
    "For a power generation plant to be built, it has to be incorporated in Sri Lanka\u2019s Long Term Generation Expansion Plan, where usually only credible plants are included, according to industry analysts. (Colombo/Mar10/2024)"
