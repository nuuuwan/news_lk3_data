    "The consignment included 23,642 ecstasy/methamphetamine tablets, 1.445 kilograms of cocaine, 993 grams of \u2018Mandy,\u2019 a synthetic chemical drug also known as MDMA, and 98 grams of Crystal Methamphetamine, also known as \u2018Ice\u2019.",
    "The drugs had been concealed inside seven courier parcels sent from countries including Germany, the Czech Republic, Zambia, the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, while they had been sent to fictitious addresses in Colombo, Panadura, Wattala, Rajagiriya, and Moratuwa.",
