### US government faces brain drain as 154,000 federal workers exit this week

*2025-10-01 15:50:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113111/us-government-faces-brain-drain-as-154000-federal-workers-exit-this-week) · `en`

More than 150,000 federal employees will leave the U.S. government payroll this week after accepting buyouts - the largest single-year exodus of civil servants in nearly 80 years, triggering what unions and governance experts warn is a damaging loss of institutional expertise.

The official resignations begin on Tuesday for workers who opted into a deferred exit program that kept them on the payroll through September. The buyouts are a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s push to shrink the federal workforce, combining financial incentives with threats of dismissal for those who declined the offer.

Many left their agencies months ago, according to the federal government’s HR office, and have effectively been on paid leave.

Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said the biggest impact of this week’s exodus will be the brain drain of so many experienced civil servants, a loss of talent he says will be hard to reverse.

### US government shutdown begins as partisan division rules Washington

*2025-10-01 13:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113103/us-government-shutdown-begins-as-partisan-division-rules-washington) · `en`

The U.S. government shut down much of its operations on Wednesday as deep partisan divisions prevented Congress and the White House from reaching a funding deal, setting off what could be a long, grueling standoff that could lead to the loss of thousands of federal jobs.

There was no clear path out of the impasse, while agencies warned that the 15th government shutdown since 1981 would halt the release of a closely watched September employment report, slow air travel, suspend scientific research, withhold pay from U.S. troops and lead to the furlough of 750,000 federal workers at a daily cost of $400 million.

Trump, whose campaign to radically reshape the federal government is already on track to push out some 300,000 workers by December, warned congressional Democrats that a shutdown could clear the path for “irreversible” actions including cutting more jobs and programs.

Eight countries, including China and Pakistan, have welcomed the 20 -stipulated plan to end the Gaza Conflict.

In this context, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to the United States on September 30. The meeting occurred at the time of Israel's intensification of the Gaza War, which caused a stir on the world stage.

This is the 4th time Netanyahu goes to the United States in the current year. Trump, who came to the white palace door, greeted Netanyahu, who came out of the car. During the talks at the White House, it seems that Gaza has been pressed on behalf of Trump to end the Gaza War immediately. Thus, there is an expectation that the Gaza War may be ended soon.

### First US Federal Shutdown in Six Years Begins After Funding Talks Collapse

The US federal government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the lights on — and no one inside the Capitol knows what will happen next.

Republicans insist Democrats need to simply agree to extend current funding for another seven weeks.

Democrats refuse to do so without major concessions for lending their votes to pass any funding measure in the Senate.

Both Republican and Democratic proposals that would have funded the government past Tuesday failed in the Senate during the eleventh hour, effectively shutting down the government at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday.

The federal government ran out of money after a Democratic-backed spending bill that would have extended health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and reversed cuts to Medicaid failed, as well as the GOP-backed stopgap funding measure that would have funded the government for seven weeks also failed.

In India, Bollywood stars are asking judges to protect their voice and persona in the era of artificial intelligence. One famous couple's biggest target is Google's video arm YouTube.

Abhishek Bachchan and his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, known for her iconic Cannes Film Festival red carpet appearances, have asked a judge to remove and prohibit creation of AI videos infringing their intellectual property rights. But in a more far-reaching request, they also want Google ordered to have safeguards to ensure such YouTube videos uploaded anyway do not train other AI platforms, legal papers reviewed by Reuters show.

A handful of Bollywood celebrities have begun asserting their "personality rights" in Indian courts over the last few years, as the country has no explicit protection for those like in many U.S. states.
