    "The $ 500 million + ITC development, comprising the Sapphire Residences and super luxury hotel ITC Ratnadipa, occupies pride of place at the centre of Colombo\u2019s most prestigious ocean front location. Overlooking the Galle Face and the Indian Ocean on one side and the Beira Lake on the other, this landmark is already redefining the city\u2019s skyline.",
    "This development by WelcomHotels Lanka Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of leading Indian conglomerate ITC Ltd. has successfully navigated significant external challenges and headwinds over the past few years and is now on course towards completion in 2023.",
    "With its distinctive architecture and the eye-catching engineering marvel, the AHASA Sky Bridge, a one-of-a-kind structure in South Asia, installed approximately 100 meters in the air to connect the two towers, this development is poised to become a globally recognised landmark for the city, if not the entire country.",
    "Sapphire Residences is all set to raise the bar of luxury living with interiors exquisitely curated in four distinctive styles by YOO Inspired by Starck. Aptly named \u2018Sky Mansions\u2019, at over double the size of other luxury apartments in Colombo, these expansive lateral homes average around 5,500 sq. ft., providing ample space for a whole family - including staff - to enjoy spacious and unhindered comfort. In addition, there are four penthouses, each covering over 9,300 sq. ft. each and two palatial Master Penthouses spanning a remarkable 19,000 sq. ft each across a single floor.",
    "Every Sky Mansion incorporates a state-of-the-art home automation solution that includes hands-free voice control and mobile devices, empowering residents with complete control of their environment and the ability to avail services on demand from the adjacent Luxury hotel ITC Ratnadipa as well. Complementing the luxury lifestyle, the over 40,000 sq. ft. of premium amenities including the exclusive private Residents\u2019 Club, swimming pools, private cinema, outdoor amphitheatre, full-service spa (with steam, sauna and treatment rooms), gymnasium and fitness centre, yoga room, indoor squash court and multi-purpose sports court etc., have been carefully designed to appeal to an elite group of like-minded individuals who appreciate the finest things in life.",
    "The development has been designed around the unwavering principle of \u2018Responsible Luxury\u2019 which allows discerning patrons to experience luxury with sustainability. Sapphire Residences has already achieved the globally respected LEED BD+C pre- certification at the highest Platinum level (Core and Shell Development), ensuring the lowest environmental impact of any building of this scale.",
    "Sapphire Residences will be defined by its residents. This extraordinary complex, which comprises only 132 Sky Mansions and Penthouses, is expected to be home to a select number of individuals who have ascended the pinnacles of success and personal achievement and will appreciate stylish, carefree living in the most luxurious and secure homes in what is perhaps the best possible location in Colombo."
