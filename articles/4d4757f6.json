    "More than 80 YSALI participants, competitively selected from alumni of previous US Government initiatives, represent the next generation of South Asian leaders and innovators in business, government, academia, health, and other fields. By connecting them with counterparts from across the region, the US is building lasting networks and cultivating future partners and advocates for American businesses and shared interests, the Embassy said.",
    "Addressing the participants, Ambassador Chung said: \u201cEach of you has already demonstrated leadership through your participation in US Government exchange programs, taking the initiative to create change, often in challenging circumstances. Now, by coming together, you are combining your ideas, talents, and dreams to shape the future of this region. Whether you\u2019re focused on entrepreneurship, civic engagement, or social innovation, we want to support your efforts and share the ideas and approaches that have fuelled American innovation and excellence, because when you succeed, the Indo-Pacific region becomes stronger, more connected, and more prosperous for all.\u201d",

The program will also foster cross-border collaboration and strengthened ties between the US and South Asia, while expanding business opportunities and addressing critical challenges across both regions, the Embassy said.",
