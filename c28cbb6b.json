    "The Bank of Ceylon (BOC) recently completed the deployment of the country\u2019s first-ever private cloud in partnership with KBSL Information Technologies Limited (KBSL), VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). To celebrate this achievement, KBSL hosted a private event at the Courtyard by Marriott.",
    "BOC\u2019s existing infrastructure required digital disruption and the bank\u2019s continuous expansion required uninterrupted capabilities to efficiently operationalize its infrastructure and support upcoming projects. Having identified these challenges and risks, VMware, a leading innovator in enterprise software providing cloud, networking and security, and digital workspace solutions, envisioned and designed a state-of-the-art architecture in collaboration with KBSL and HPE. The architecture will aim to support the bank\u2019s digital transformation journey, offering agility at the pace of cloud adoption and building a future-ready architecture.",
    "With the implementation of the private cloud on-premises, BOC will have an automated and simplified data center management, more intrinsic security platform for business-critical workloads, and be able to deploy and release newer versions of applications using some of the very latest technologies, with the ability to scale solutions across private and public cloud, giving higher agility, speed-to-market, and relevance.",
    "\u201cThe partnership with KBSL, VMware, and HPE has demonstrated the ability for key partners of the bank to deliver exemplary technology solutions that are best of breed. We believe this initiative will enhance the experience delivered to all our stakeholders involved to their utmost satisfaction.\u201d said President\u2019s Counsel Ronald C. Perera, Chairman, Bank of Ceylon.",
    "\u201cAs the leading bank in the country, we work to deliver best-in-the-class products and services to all our stakeholders. With the synergy that was brought together with this collaboration, the bank can help its customers to deliver a world-class service and fulfill its commitments as a state bank towards the Sri Lankan economic wellbeing,\u201d stated Russel Fonseka, General Manager, Bank of Ceylon.",
