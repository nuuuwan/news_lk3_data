    "(Excerpts of a lecture delivered at the launch of the book  Sri Lanka\u2019s Defence Policy Since Independence and the Shifting Balance of Power in the Indian Ocean, authored by Professor Gamini Keerawella)",
    "The launch of this timely and scholarly work comes at a critical juncture in regional and global geopolitics. As a nation strategically located at the heart of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka must continuously evaluate and adapt its defence policy to the evolving security landscape. Professor Keerawella\u2019s book provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of Sri Lanka\u2019s defence posture, from independence to the present, while also situating the island nation within the broader geopolitical dynamics of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).",
    "In my professional capacity\u2014as a naval officer, diplomat, and former Foreign Secretary\u2014I have observed, firsthand, the increasing complexity of maritime affairs and strategic competition in the Indian Ocean. The rise of new power centres, the re-emergence of great power rivalry, and the growing importance of sea lines of communication (SLOCs) underscore the need for small and strategically located nations, like Sri Lanka, to develop nuanced, pragmatic, and future-oriented defence strategies.",
    "Professor Keerawella\u2019s research contributes significantly to this national and regional discourse. His work not only chronicles Sri Lanka\u2019s defence policy evolution, but also critically assesses how global and regional power shifts\u2014particularly between China, India, and the United States\u2014are reshaping the strategic environment around the island. In doing so, he highlights the strategic choices that confront Sri Lanka and the importance of preserving our sovereignty, neutrality, and maritime security through a well-calibrated foreign and defence policy.",
    "This publication fills a significant gap in the literature on South Asian security studies and should be considered essential reading for policymakers, strategists, academics, and anyone interested in the future of Sri Lanka and the wider Indian Ocean region.",
    "The author traces how global and regional geopolitical changes have shaped Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic outlook, raising a fundamental question: does Sri Lanka have a coherent and documented national security or foreign policy?",
    "Having served for 43 years in the military, in national security policymaking, and in diplomatic roles, I find this question deeply relevant. My personal experience confirms the central argument of this book\u2014that Sri Lanka\u2019s policies have been ad hoc and reactive rather than guided by a consistent long-term vision.",
    "One of the book\u2019s core themes is the transformation of the 21st century into a multipolar and transactional world order. Unlike the Cold War\u2019s binary alignments or the post\u2013Cold War unipolar moment, today\u2019s global system is marked by competition among multiple powers and gradually becoming a multi-polar world in geopolitical and economic sense.",
    "The Indian Ocean is now the main artery and the centre of gravity of global trade, carrying 72% of energy shipments, 50% of container traffic, and 35% of bulk cargo. This region has become an arena of intense strategic competition, convergence of interests, and strategic ambiguity, particularly for small and medium-sized states.",
    "Keerawella highlights how unpredictable global events have immediate consequences for countries like Sri Lanka. For example, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine caused oil prices to rise by USD 5 per barrel, costing Sri Lanka an additional USD 73 million annually. Similar disruptions followed strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. These examples underscore the vulnerability of small nations to geopolitical shocks and the urgent need for robust national security planning.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s geographic position, astride vital sea lanes, has long been recognised as a strategic asset. As Admiral Harry Harris once noted, the island\u2019s three main advantages are \u201clocation, location, and location.\u201d However, Prof. Keerawella asks whether Sri Lanka has truly leveraged this position\u2014or whether it has been more of a liability at certain times? Since independence, Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign and defence relations have lacked consistency and clear direction. Policy has often evolved reactively, driven by short-term considerations rather than strategic foresight.",
    "Geography cannot be altered. Nations must live with it and craft policies accordingly. Sri Lanka can no longer rely on vague non-alignment and ad hoc diplomacy. To preserve its strategic autonomy, Sri Lanka must adopt free and independent defence and foreign policies rooted firmly in its national interests rather than external agendas.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s national interests are outlined in its Constitution and broader policy discourse, include:",
    "National security today encompasses more than military defence. It now includes economic, food, health, cyber, and environmental security. To achieve these goals, nations must employ multiple instruments of national power\u2014diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME). The Diplomatic power would include: Embassies, Ambassadors, treaties, negotiations, policies, international forums. The Informational power would be: Military information, public diplomacy, public affairs, communication resources, international forums, spokepersons. The Military component would include: military operations, engagements, security cooperations, show of force, military technology, size and composition of force. The Economic aspects would be: trade policies, fiscal and monetary policies, tariffs, embargoes, aid.",
    "Sri Lanka must also fully utilise its maritime domain for its economic development and prosperity. The country\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) spans 517,000 square kilometres\u2014eight times its landmass\u2014yet remains under-monitored and underdeveloped. Prof. Keerawella emphasises the need for strategic surveillance, maritime scientific research, and sustainable blue economy projects. Without these, Sri Lanka is forced to react to the policies of others rather than set its own course.",
    "The book reminds readers of Sri Lanka\u2019s proud diplomatic heritage: the Colombo Plan of 1950, the Colombo Powers meeting of 1954, leading to the Bandung Conference in 1955, the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, and the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace proposal in 1971. These examples show that Sri Lanka once exercised strategic vision and leadership on the world stage. Ironically, many India Ocean littorals still need the conditions stipulated in the IOPZ such as; de-militarisation, nuclear free zone, geopolitical neutrality, protection of sovereignty, freedom of navigation for all nations and dialogue and cooperation to resolve disputes. Sri Lanka also missed a golden opportunity to join ASEAN in 1967 and now trying to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership of ASEAN without much success.",
    "Study of history is of paramount importance as then we can identify patterns, learn from successes and failures, and potentially predict, or prepare, for future scenarios. Sri Lanka has suffered immensely due to armed insurrections, civil war, foreign military intervention, international monitoring mission to monitor ceasefire, and natural calamities, such as the 2004 Tsunami. These events retarded the country\u2019s economic progress which resulted in economic crises in 2022.",
    "The Indian Ocean is today more militarised than ever, with 120 to 130 foreign warships present at any given time. Nuclear submarines also patrol these waters, raising concerns about strategic instability. Keerawella examines the shift from Asia-Pacific to Indo-Pacific as a geopolitical construct, noting India\u2019s evolving policies\u2014from \u201cLook East\u201d to SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and then to MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions). At the same time, US\u2013China competition has intensified. The question remains whether the Indo-Pacific will be a space for collaboration or confrontation.",
    "The Indian Ocean Region is also home to mistrust and insecurity among nations. Insecurity of one nation and actions taken by that nation to increase its own security can give rise to insecurity of other nations. This can lead to increased militarisation and higher defence expenditure leading to potential conflict.",
    "Majority of maritime strategies of major and aspiring major powers in the Indian Ocean are exclusive in nature and the hidden objective is to counter the rise of China. However, the best option would be to accommodate economic engagement with China while simultaneously upholding norms that constrain aggressive military behaviour.",
    "The book critiques how Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy has been fragmented by domestic political priorities and external pressures. Lacking a clearly articulated defence or foreign policy, the country has often zigzagged between competing alignments. Prof. Keerawella calls for an integrated approach that aligns foreign policy and national security strategy under a single long-term vision. Keerawella also highlight the close relationship between defence policy and foreign policy, as development in one sphere often influence decisions of the other.",
    "Prof. Gamini Keerawella\u2019s work is a vital contribution to understanding Sri Lanka\u2019s post-independence strategic trajectory. It demonstrates how global power shifts, regional competition, and internal political dynamics have influenced Sri Lanka\u2019s defence policy. Most importantly, it highlights the absence of a coherent, documented national strategy.",
    "This book provides not only a historical analysis but also a framework for future policy. It challenges scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to formulate a comprehensive defence and foreign policy\u2014even after 77 years of independence. Such a vision is essential for ensuring Sri Lanka\u2019s security, prosperity, and standing in the international community.",
    "Prof. Keerawella\u2019s research deserves recognition. It should inspire a new generation of thinkers to continue this work and push Sri Lanka towards strategic clarity and purposeful engagement with the world.",
