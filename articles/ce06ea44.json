    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s tax revenues grew 56 percent to 2,512 billion rupees during the 11 months to November, with total revenues rising to 2,758 billion rupees, but the deficit surged with a spike in interest costs, official data shows.",
    "Monthly tax collections were 299 billion in November, data released by the central bank showed.",
    "Current spending surged to 4,292.8 billion rupees, up 46 percent, data released by the central bank showed as interest costs surged. Non-interest costs rose by a more moderate 14.5 percent.",
    "Interest costs which were 1,772 billion rupees up to October surged to 2,351 billion rupees by November 2023.",
    "Interest costs usually rise in the stabilization year in Sri Lanka after the central bank triggers a currency crisis by cutting rates with reverse repo injections to target inflation or growth or both.",
    "Sri Lanka began stabilization by allowing interest rates to rise in April 2022.",
    "However, interest rates in government securities surged further over fears that there will be full default in domestic securities to meet International Monetary Fund gross financing need statistics.",
    "Officials have minimized the impact of domestic bonds, allowing the markets to function and rates to come down. However the coupon on re-structured bonds which were held by the EPF would be at 12.5 percent until 2025.",
    "It is not clear what impact the restructuring has on the first two years.",
    "The so-called primary balance before interest, which is tracked by the IMF as the main budget performance criterion was a surplus of 331 billion rupees. As interest rates have to rise to stabilize forex shortages from earlier rate cuts, it does not make sense to track the current account or overall deficit.",

    "Capital spending was contained at 498 billion rupees up to November, rising 7 percent.",
