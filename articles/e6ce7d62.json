    "Professor Malalasekera, often referred to as \u201cGPM,\u201d was a visionary who dedicated his life to educational reform and national pride amidst the challenges of colonial rule. Inspired by influential figures within the Buddhist educational movement, he played a significant role in shaping Sri Lanka\u2019s national education system and instilling cultural values that resonated across generations.",
    "At the launch event, held at the National Archives auditorium in Colombo and attended by family, foundation members, scholars, and civil activists, the book\u2019s author, Venerable Wetara Mahinda Thero, shared his motivation for undertaking this significant project:",
    "\u201cThe primary objective of launching this book stemmed from my readings of previous books published about Professor Gunapala Malalasekera. In studying these, I realized that some of his most impactful contributions to Buddhism and to our country had not been fully captured. I felt a strong need to create a comprehensive portrayal of Professor Malalasekera\u2019s life, including a rich collection of portraits to bring to life the real moments and experiences that defined him.",
    "\u201cWith this goal in mind, I embarked on an extensive research journey, traveling across the country to ensure this book accurately represents Professor Malalasekera\u2019s legacy and makes it accessible to readers. I hope this book not only honors his remarkable life but also brings readers closer to his invaluable contributions.\u201d",

    "\u201cOn behalf of the Malalasekera Foundation and our family, I am honored to share this message in recognition of Venerable Wetara Mahinda\u2019s thoughtfully compiled work. A devoted scholar of my grandfather\u2019s life, Venerable Mahinda has shed light on GPM\u2019s enduring contributions to academia, Buddhist scholarship, and nation-building. This book reflects his significant influence in areas beyond his academic pursuits, including his humanitarian work and profound contributions to the arts. We extend our deepest gratitude to Venerable Mahinda for his relentless dedication to preserving GPM\u2019s legacy.\u201d",
