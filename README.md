### Sri Lanka to announce single overnight policy rate from Nov 27

*2024-11-26 21:49:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-announce-single-overnight-policy-rate-from-nov-27-190053/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs central bank will announce a single overnight policy rate from November 27, instead of the current policy corridor involving standing deposit facilities, the monetary authority said.

The standing lending and deposit facilities, will remain as a margin to the announced overnight policy rate.

The central bank will continue to target an average call money rate with liquidity operations.

Critics have warned that the denial monetary stability, especially from 2015, which led to serial currency crises, borrowing to repay debt, borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum for current transactions, was a consequence of excess money printed to target a mid-corridor rate (a de facto single policy rate).

Sri Lanka has been running broadly deflationary policy from around September 2022, withdrawing liquidity through outright transactions, but concerns have been raised at initial inflationary policy through its overnight and term operations.
