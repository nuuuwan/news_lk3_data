    "A group of Members of Parliament from the opposition have sent a letter to the Election Commission, requesting that the Presidential Election be held on the earliest possible date in order to prevent any attempts to delay polls.",
    "Accordingly, the parliamentarians urged the commission to exercise its maximum legal authority to ensure the election is conducted in a free and fair atmosphere.",
    "The letter has been signed by a majority of opposition MPs including members of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) as well other independent opposition MPs.",
    "The letter states: \u201cIt is no secret that the current government, worried about the possible loss in the upcoming presidential election, is making various efforts to postpone the presidential election scheduled for year 2024.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnother trick in that process was revealed the other day. It is to bring a bill for an amendment to the provisions of the Constitution regarding the term of office of the President, which has already been dearly interpreted by the Supreme Cent.\u201d",
    "\u201cAccording to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Presidential Election which is a major election in which the guaranteed inalienable sovereignty of the people and the right to vote are experimented should not be postponed for any reason.\u201d",
    "\u201c02 years ago, the then anti-people ruler was ousted by a struggle of the general public and a temporary caretaker president was appointed only for the remainder of the term, not on the basis of direct popular will, but through the vote of elected Members of Parliament.\u201d",
    "\u201cTherefore, the citizens should be given the opportunity, to elect a new president with the will of the people to exercise executive powers on their behalf at the earliest possible opportunity.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is your absolute duty as the Election Commission and ours as public representatives and active political movements.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn view of these facts, I kindly request you to make necessary arrangements to hold the presidential election on the first possible day and to exercise your legal powers in full to conduct the election in a free and fair atmosphere.\u201d"
