    "Formal talks began at 10 a.m. on the 21st. Before their commencement there was an exchange of gifts. These normally are not particularly valuable. They are tokens. By and large from our side, it was a silver moonstone tray. We didn\u2019t have any major problems with the Chinese and the talks proceeded smoothly and with a degree of informality and good humour. By 11.15 a.m. we had finished. The fact that the Head of the Chinese delegation understood and spoke some English also helped to expedite matters. At 6.30 p.m. a banquet was given in honour of the Deputy Minister by the Chinese Vice Minister. As was customary, this was an elaborate affair. We lost count of the number of courses.",
    "The practice at these banquets is that you don\u2019t eat too much of any single course. Instead, you taste a wide variety and range of food. Interestingly, the Chinese serve rice last. When the rice arrives, one knows that the main courses are now over and fruit and desert are to follow. The courses are accompanied with wines and the potent Moutai, a colourless alcoholic drink with I believe a rye base which even a non-drinker must take a sip of to follow social convention. These banquets are leisurely and relaxing with the relation of a great deal of anecdotes and general good humour.",
    "Over the next few days, our Chinese hosts had laid out an interesting programme of visits. These included Museums; Factories; Palaces and the Mao Mausoleum, where the late Chairman\u2019s body was preserved in a glass casket, in the manner of Lenin in Russia. On some evenings we were taken to cultural shows, a more dramatic one being a dance-drama on the separation of China and Taiwan. One night the Vice-Minister took us out for dinner to a newly opened Peking duck restaurant with a seating capacity of over 5000 people!",
    "In such a populous country as China, restaurants are filled with numbers that don\u2019t gather in stadiums of other countries. The duck itself was delicious with pieces served piping hot which you then dip into an excellent sauce mix, roll in a pancake with spring onion and eat. But behind all this elegant dining there is an element of cruelty. The ducks that are served are force-fed \u2018or 60 days and killed. Perhaps death is more merciful than being continuously force-fed.",
    "On the 24th of November, towards the end of our stay in Beijing, we were taken to the Western Hills to visit a Pagoda believed to contain a Tooth Relic of the Buddha. This was of great interest to us, since we are also in possession of a Tooth Relic of the Buddha in Sri Lanka. The Buddhists in the delegation offered flowers and worshipped at the temple.",
    "On our last day in Beijing, the 26th morning, the Deputy Minister and the delegation called on Vice Prime Minister Yao-Ji-Ling. The conversation was characteristically relaxed and very friendly. At 4 p.m. the Deputy Minister and delegation called on the Minister of Trade.",
    "This was followed by the formal signing of the Rubber-Rice Protocol for 1980. Afterwards, champagne was served. There was the usual battery of Press and TV cameras. The calls on the Vice Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and the signing ceremony were prominently displayed in the late evening T.V. news. In the night, was the return banquet by our Deputy Minister at the International Club. It was another convivial occasion.",
    "The next day the 27th we flew to Guilin. This was part of the arrangement whereby, according to tradition, delegations from each other\u2019s countries were taken to see some interesting places in their respective countries before their departure. Therefore, the same practice was obtained when the Chinese visited Sri Lanka. The distinction of Guilin was that spread out everywhere were quite fantastic rock and hill formations like huge ant hills. You saw them almost everywhere.",
    "They appeared to be geologically unique. During the afternoon we were taken to the \u201cReed Pipe Cave,\u201d where there was a fascinating array of limestone formations in the shapes of mushrooms; castles; old men; lions and many others. At 6.30 p.m. a dinner was hosted for us by the Chairman of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee Guilin. We sat at a number of round tables. One of the members of our delegation unwisely accepted the challenge of a veteran revolutionary",
    "y to drink Moutai in competition with him. By the time we finished dinner and got back to our hotel, he had reached the stage of mild indiscretion and great jollity. Those experienced in such matters have recorded that those having alcoholic drinks and continuing to drink, progressively reach four stages of inebriation characterized as jocose; bellicose, lachrymose and finally comatose. Our friend was simultaneously in the first and third stage, mercifully having bypassed the second. He was not happy about being confined to his room and began to come out to the corridor, imagining that he had a good voice and therefore could sing. This became a bit of a serious problem.",
    "So, all of us except for the Deputy Minister, who had already retired for the night went into his room and tried to persuade him to change and get to bed. But he appeared to be particularly nervous about getting into bed. We asked him why. He said that there was someone in his bed. We patted the bed and tried to demonstrate that there was nobody there. He said yes, there was no one now but when he got into bed, then there was someone there! He had reached that kind of metaphysical condition! Someone had to finally wait with him for a long time in his room until lie had at last fallen asleep. The following morning, he was quite surprised at the heights of philosophy he had scaled the previous night.",
    "On the 28th, we were taken on a boat trip down the Lijiang River, with lunch served on board. We cruised through rugged and beautiful scenery with mountain formations of fantastic shapes. After we got back, in the evening we saw a Chinese classical film. It was elaborate and slow. Next day, the 29th, we took a flight back to Canton. During the afternoon, we visited the Port of Whampoa on the Pearl River. This was an important Port for us since most of our rice shipments came from here.",
    "We spent quite a while visiting the facilities and talking to officials. A dinner was hosted by the Foreign Trade Bureau of Canton. The next two days, the 30th of November and the I\u201d of December, we were taken to a large People\u2019s Commune with a population of over 70,000. Agriculture and the light industry were the main activities. After lunch, we set out for the Fashan District in another county, a journey of over three hours, crossing two ferries over branches of the Pearl River.",
    "Even these branches were large and very wide. At our destination, we visited factories and an Agricultural University for workers set up by former Prime Minister Zhou-En-Lai. The large sugar factory there was very interesting, because of the ancillary facilities for the production of yeast; industrial alcohol and paper board from bagasse. It was an impressive integrated facility. We concluded our stay with a visit to a silk factory.",
    "The visit was a great education to all of us. We talked to so many people and saw so many things. It deepened knowledge and experience. We had the rare privilege of seeing so much of China during a period when it was still very much a closed country and at a time when many scholars and interpreters particularly from the West could only speculate on what was happening there. We learned much from our discussions with Vice Prime Ministers, Ministers, Vice-Ministers, Senior Officials; Mayors; Heads of Revolutionary Committees and Communes and many others. We saw a country intensively cultivated, with crops growing even on many railway embankments.",
    "A great deal of effort and skill had gone into water management, with water impounded everywhere, and an irrigation system small and large Criss-crossing the country. We saw all types of grains; vegetables and fruits cultivated extensively and combined with animal husbandry. There seemed to be a major thrust on the planting of trees. This was really something to see and learn from. Trees were planted everywhere, even in the middle of cities. Many roads both big and small had double rows of trees planted on both sides.",
    "All in all, we saw a society busy at work and demonstrating great energy. Modern sophistication was lacking. But a thaw and an opening to the world were clearly visible. Apart from a greater freedom in the dress code, one saw the beginning of a free market in surplus vegetables, fruits, grains and livestock, not to forget the huge killed rats laid out for sale. Private plots of land for cultivation were being cautiously permitted. Street artists were drawing, painting and selling their pictures to the modest number of tourists beginning to come in. It was evident that China was slowly lifting the bamboo curtains and that the economic system was seeing the beginning of a gradual shift towards profits and incentives. We got back to Sri Lanka to the customary busy schedule.",
    "There are naturally many problems involved in the unloading, transport and storage of large quantities of food. One such problem related to street urchins who had made an art of slashing bags stacked in open lorries, with blades or knives and collecting into tins the rice, flour or sugar seeping out. These acts took place in the busy Fort and Pettah areas when lorries had to travel slowly or be completely halted due to traffic jams.",
    "We managed to get the presence of some extra policemen in the more vulnerable areas. Sometimes problems arose due to corruption in the police itself. On one occasion, I received information that a whole lorry load of flour had been slipped out of the Port without documentation. My informant gave me details and said that the flour had been unloaded into a godown in the Pettah, but that we should act fast because very soon the stock would be dispersed. He also told me that the officer in charge of the Pettah police station had been bribed and that investigations should not be handed over to that station. In many instances, when theft or pilferage took place it was not easy to catch the culprits.",
    "Here, there appeared to be some prospect of apprehension. I thought that the matter was important enough for the Minister himself to call the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Rudra Rajasingham, particularly because it seemed important to keep the local police station out of the investigations. Mr. Herat telephoned the IGP. I was seated opposite. To a question, I heard the Minister replying \u201cThe OIC Pettah.\u201d The next moment he was laughing uproariously.",
    "After the conversation, I asked the Minister as what was so funny. Still laughing, the Minister said that the IGP had asked \u201cThe OIC of what station?\u201d and when he replied \u201cPettah,\u201d he had immediately said \u201cOh, that rogue!\u201d Sad to say, law and disorder seemed to have combined too well in this case. The culprits were not caught.",
    "There were a number of ingenious ways of committing theft. In fact, this is a subject on which a separate chapter could be written. But I will mention only one example. It came to light that a number of rather large stones were beginning to accumulate near some of the food stores. Investigations revealed that some drivers and cleaners sold some bags on the way from the Port and put under their seats heavy stones which would approximate to the weight of the missing bags.",
    "Therefore, when the lorry went over the weighbridge at the stores, the weight was almost right. Thereafter, the stones were quietly taken out, because the empty lorry was weighed once again on its way out. Preventing this sort of thing, and even discovering frauds after they were committed were a serious preoccupation of many. On one occasion, in order to discover an alleged massive fraud at one of our bigger store complexes, we had to arrange for CID officers to see the Food Commissioner at his residence, since their coming to office would have leaked out.",
    "Ultimately, we introduced police personnel disguised as labourers to the Co-operative labour gangs working in the stores. This detailed strategy was successful and some important people were caught. But by that time, they had made enough money to retain the leading and the most expensive criminal lawyers to defend them in Court.",
