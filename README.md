### Repeal of Presidents’ Entitlements Act: Reform or retrospective punishment?

*2025-09-15 01:55:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Repeal-of-Presidents-Entitlements-Act-Reform-or-retrospective-punishment/4-781649) · `en`

In considering the repeal of the Presidents’ Entitlements Act, the nation must weigh the difference between cutting extravagance and eroding respect. Historical judgment is unforgiving, and societies are often remembered not just for their policies but for their treatment of those who served them at great personal cost. Stripping entitlements retroactively, however well-intentioned, risks leaving a record of pettiness rather than prudence

In recent months, the repeal of Sri Lanka’s Presidents’ Entitlements Act has sparked intense debate across political and social circles. At first glance, the move seems a demonstration of fiscal prudence—a government taking decisive steps to curb what many perceive as excessive privileges.

### Independent central bank is for citizens and not for politicians

*2025-09-15 01:33:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Independent-central-bank-is-for-citizens-and-not-for-politicians/4-781647) · `en`

Three years ago, in 2022, inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index or CCPI was running on average at about 63% and the official exchange rate was unstable with a lucrative black market for foreign currencies. All indications were that Sri Lanka, unless proper policies would be adopted, would descend to a basket case like Lebanon. This did not happen because the central bank’s management, with financial as well as policy support of the International Monetary Fund or IMF, was able to tame the rising inflation and keep the exchange rate at a stable level

In a recent talk show titled ‘Modern Talk’ hosted by Channel 7 television, successor to the former YA Television, the young talk show hostess Nimna Perera asked me whether the current central bank management had been doing its job properly in managing the economy.1

Both students in Bangla and youth in Nepal were ultimately represented by small groups the military accepted and were projected as instruments of change

In Bangladesh and in Nepal, though with commonalities in the initial “leaderless” single issue protests, establishing a new rule was different to Sri Lanka and remains unconstitutional too. From nowhere a few youth in Bangladesh claiming to represent the university student protest and accepted as such by the military usurped the right to nominate Muhammud Yunus, the former head of the Grameen Bank as interim PM. He was in self-exile in France, and there were no indications of any discussions and dialogue among students and protesting groups, on who should head the interim government and how it should be constituted

*2025-09-15 00:33:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225088) · `ta`

The entire nation must be honored with former President Ranil Wickremesinghe for protecting our country from that situation and taking it on the right path.. United National Party (UNP) Chairman Vajira Abeywardena said that sowing jealousy and hatred in the hearts of the people could not benefit Sri Lanka.

We know about the tragic situation that took place last week in Nepal. The same incident took place in our country 3 years ago. When the situation returns to the serious state, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister of our country, quickly took steps to stop the burning of others after his home was burnt.

So the entire nation must be honored with Ranil Wickremesinghe, who protected our country from that situation and brought it on the right path.. Causing problems is the highlight of a democratic community. It must be remembered that controlling them is a highlight of a democratic society.

However, the Sri Lanka Small and Medium Scale Paddy Mill Owners’ Association is requesting that no steps be taken to remove the maximum retail price of rice as they claim that large-scale rice mill owners are trying to create an artificial shortage of rice and gain profits.

Meanwhile, the National Farmers’ Union says that the government should intervene immediately and provide solutions to this issue.

In a recent talk show titled ‘Modern Talk’ hosted by Channel 7 television, successor to the former YA Television, the young talk show hostess Nimna Perera asked me whether the current central bank management had been doing its job properly in managing the economy.[1]

As a journalist, she was voicing the sentiments of the public openly in that talk show. There should not be objection to this approach because that is the duty of an anchor-woman by her viewers. In answering her question, I summarily told her that the central bank is an independent organisation as mandated by the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act or CBA and, under the mandate given to it by the new legislation, it is doing perfectly well in taming inflation and restoring the stability of the exchange rate. However, it requires further elaboration.

The Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka has announced a national education reform initiative scheduled for implementation in 2026. Within this context, this paper argues for the integration of Sri Lankan Studies as a compulsory subject at both secondary and tertiary levels of education. The rationale derives from comparative international experiences where structured national studies such as American Studies, Chinese Studies, and Russian Studies are institutionalized to cultivate civic consciousness, strengthen national identity, and enhance democratic participation. Sri Lanka, despite its complex postcolonial trajectory and protracted ethnic conflict, lacks a coherent academic framework that synthesizes its history, cultural plurality, political institutions, and developmental challenges. Existing subjects such as Civic Education remain fragmented, outdated, and inadequate in fostering justice-oriented citizenship.
