    "The effort of the March 12 Movement, a civil society collective, to bring presidential candidates onto one platform and share their visions and hopes with the general population was successful in its second round. All six of the presidential candidates who had been scheduled for the debate participated as expected and shared their visions and aspirations for the future.\u00a0Their message went through the electronic and mass media to the general public. Although titled as a \u201cpresidential debate\u201d the structure of the programme was different from that practiced in the United States, where the presidential candidates engage in verbal sparring with one another.\u00a0 The Sri Lankan version was to pose the same question to each of the presidential candidates and have them answer within a set time limit.",
    "The intention of the March 12 Movement was to provide an opportunity for the presidential candidates to present their views on issues of interest to the public rather than engage in debate on them. At the conclusion of the presentations, the audience was to be invited to submit their questions in written form where they would be screened for content by a committee and passed on the candidates for their responses. \u00a0However, despite all these safeguards to ensure the presidential candidates a safe environment, the first round of the debates held the previous day saw only one of the six invited candidates appear for the debate.\u00a0 The others, including the three main presidential candidates, did not join.\u00a0 They either declined in advance or failed to show up at the time of the event much to the chagrin of the audience, some of whom had come from Jaffna, Anuradhapura and Puttalam.",
    "It appears that the tight nature of the three-cornered race between the presidential candidates is leading to a stressful situation in which none of them is willing to take a risk and expose themselves to an audience that is not in their sphere of influence. This was a negative phenomenon, as an open clash of different positions, strategies and actions on common issues is beneficial to educating the general public as well as generating new ideas about facing the future in the spirit of a shared future.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the tight nature of the presidential election time around, with three main candidates in the field, and not two as usual has also led to a significant amount of negative campaigning where the focus is on criticizing one or both of the nearest rival candidates.",
    "In recent weeks, public opinion polls have shown President Ranil Wickremesinghe to be the biggest gainer (in proportional terms) in comparison to his two main rivals, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.\u00a0 However, these same surveys also show that the president continues to lag behind his rivals.\u00a0 This may explain the measures being resorted to by the presidential candidates such as engaging in negative campaigning by critiquing the qualities of their rivals.\u00a0 At the same time, they have also been engaging in positive campaigning regarding the need to address the country\u2019s most pressing problems.\u00a0 There has been a convergence among them on the need to abide by the basic framework of the IMF agreement which has opened the doors to the country\u2019s economic ties with the larger world.",
    "There is also convergence on the part of the three main presidential candidates on the need to deal with the country\u2019s ethnic conflict.\u00a0 They have all promised to deal with the issue in a way that will unite the people on the principles of equality and justice.\u00a0 They have all been making strenuous efforts to win the votes of the ethnic and religious minorities. This is very positive, as the ethnic conflict has been a part of divisive politics since the dawn of independence.\u00a0 However, due to the tight\u00a0nature of the competition, there is also negative campaigning vis-\u00e0-vis each other.\u00a0 During a recent visit to Jaffna, the NPP leader called on the Tamil voters not to thwart his victory or be seen as not being on the winning side along with voters in the south of the country who will vote for him.\u00a0 This has been portrayed as an implied threat to the Tamil people whereby he has called on them to vote for him and be a part of the electoral victory that the NPP/JVP is seeking rather than voting against him and losing the opportunity to be a part of this victory.",
    "The approach by ITAK spokesperson M A Sumanthiran has been positive in this regard.\u00a0 He has disagreed with the negative interpretation given to the NPP leader\u2019s speech in Jaffna and said he never thought the NPP leader made that statement with a view to expressing any racist feelings and that he has taken great care in eradicating racism in this country. The ITAK spokesperson said he would work with the NPP to eradicate corruption and misrule in the country.\u00a0Indeed, these are the two most important aspects of the Aragalaya protest movement that led to the premature change of government two years ago but which have yet to be dealt with. These laudable statements by Mr Sumanthiran are now the subject of misinterpretation that he has changed sides.",
    "The key role in the recent decision of the ITAK to endorse the presidential bid of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa was also made by Mr Sumanthiran.\u00a0\u00a0 He led the ITAK to make a choice between the presidential candidates and to select the candidate whose manifesto and past commitment was believed to be the best for the Tamil people at this juncture.\u00a0 At the same time, he has shown that he will not be hostile to other political parties and their leaders, even those his party has not endorsed, and be open to cooperate with them in the best interests of the Tamil people.\u00a0 The spirit of leadership that the country needs is not to hold grudges, to look for the best in others and to hold them to the highest standards.",
    "The Sri Lankan people continue to suffer in the aftermath of the economic collapse that took place over two and a half years ago.\u00a0 The need of the hour is national unity to face the local and international challenges that a world which is itself increasingly in conflict will find difficult to focus on.\u00a0 This suggests that the Sri Lankan polity cannot afford to be torn apart by polarization and misinterpretation which can generate more of the same. \u00a0The vicious cycle needs to be addressed.\u00a0 The country and its people need to be united to face the challenges.\u00a0 In a situation where the people\u2019s vote will be split more than three ways, the possibilities of polarization are increased.",
    "The hope of the March 12 Movement in organizing the presidential debates has been to provide a platform where the presidential candidates can indicate the areas of their agreement on fundamental issues so that government policies would be consistent regardless of changes of government. President Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment at a media conference when he said \u201cWe need a political system that supports basic fundamentals, even if we differ on details. This is what our country needs and what all desire.\u201d\u00a0 The challenge to each of the presidential candidates is to commit themselves to support the winner of the presidential election, even if it is not themselves that wins. The way they conduct themselves and address the people and their opponents during the election campaign will determine the prospects for reconciliation in the future.",
