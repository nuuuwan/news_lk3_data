    "The possible showdown between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg will be streamed on X, formerly known as Twitter, according to Musk.",
    "In a pair of tweets Sunday morning, the platform\u2019s owner said he was \u201clifting weights throughout the day, preparing for the fight,\u201d adding \u201call proceeds will go to charity for veterans.\u201d",
    "In June, the two Big Tech billionaires seemingly agreed to participate in a cage fight. The stakes for the potential fight were raised last month when Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta launched a new Twitter competitor called Threads.",
    "Zuckerberg replied to Musk via Threads on Sunday afternoon, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?\u201d",
    "He added: \u201cI\u2019m ready today. I suggested Aug 26 when (Musk) first challenged, but he hasn\u2019t confirmed. Not holding my breath.\u201d",
    "Since Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter in October 2022, policy pivots, technical issues, and the platform\u2019s stance on harassment and hate speech have given many users whiplash. When Threads was released, some saw it as a viable alternative that might unseat its rival, and the app saw enormous initial success. A lawyer representing Twitter even threatened a lawsuit over Threads.",
    "CNN reached out to Twitter and Meta for comment but have not received a response.(CNN)"
