Three police officers have been injured and hospitalised following the tense situation during a protest in front of the Ministry of Education at Isurupaya, Battaramulla this afternoon (02).

Accordingly, a Sub-Inspector of Police (SI) and two constables have been injured during the tense situation that prevailed as the police attempted to disperse a group of Development Officers who were protesting in front of the Ministry of Education.

Meanwhile, one of the injured police officers has been transferred to the ICU for further treatment, Ada Derana reporter said.

It was reported that four protesters have been arrested in connection with the incident.

The Development Officers had engaged in the demonstration demanding that they be made permanent in the teaching service.

### Cabinet leak of the Katchativu Agreement and rescinded cabinet decision on Overseas Service

‚ÄúThe Prime Minister felt betrayed. She was embarrassed, bitter and angry. She was sensitive to Mrs. Gandhi‚Äôs feelings‚Äù

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.

Dudley Senanayake in the short Parliament of March to July 1960

Family and background had been central in Dudley Senanayake‚Äôs case too. Greatness had literally been thrust on him when he had been appointed prime minister on the death of his father D S, in 1952. That had been a time of intrigue and maneuvering which had soured the relations between Sir John, his close relative and him.

Sir John had struck back with the Premier Stakes which he later denied having any connection with. So Dudley had been anxious to win his spurs for himself through the hustings as early as possible. And he had proved his legitimacy by winning the 1952 elections handsomely, helped by the sympathy vote created by the death of his father. But his first stint as prime minister did not last long. Plagued by illness, chronic gastritis and the hartal of August 1953 which resulted in police firing and some civilian deaths, Dudley resigned.
