The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has announced that it will submit its proposal for the revision of electricity tariffs to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) today (06).

Responding to an inquiry made by Ada Derana, CEB Chairman Dr. Thilak Siyambalapitiya confirmed that the proposal would be submitted as scheduled.

Previously, it was proposed under the former government that electricity tariffs be revised four times annually. However, in 2023, tariff revisions were carried out three times, while two revisions were made this year. The current government has limited tariff revisions to twice a year.

The proposal submitted today is expected to revise electricity tariffs for the first half of 2025, with implementation anticipated from the third week of January next year.

The International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) has submitted a detailed dossier to international governments and organisations, urging sanctions and travel bans on more than 60 Sri Lankans, including senior military personnel, Tamil paramilitaries, civil servants, and former ministers.

The submissions highlight gross human rights violations, corruption during and after Sri Lanka‚Äôs armed conflict, and economic crimes that have deepened the nation‚Äôs financial crisis. The requests were sent to the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United Nations.

‚ÄúIn the absence of any criminal accountability to date, it is vital to document past and current crimes, analyse evidence, and use every available channel to assert the truth. We hope the UK will impose sanctions on Human Rights Day this year for alleged war crimes committed during the country‚Äôs conflict,‚Äù ITJP Executive Director Yasmin Sooka said.

They may still feel trapped in the same plight, and unless that perception is acknowledged, addressed, and their aspirations realised, the resurgence of dissent is not merely possible but inevitable

It is now 15 years since the end of a brutal 30-year conflict. Yet, we remain trapped in a cycle of grief, division, and mistrust. This cannot continue. If we do, we will head down a path to ruin.

A rare and golden opportunity stands before us now. The recently concluded general elections have sent a powerful message: our communities are ready to rise above the shackles of communal politics and chart a new course toward unity and hope.

Addressing the matter now has profound significance in view of the ‚ÄòMaaveerar Naal‚Äô (Great Heroes Day) that fell on 27 November, and comments made by a newly appointed independent MP representing the Jaffna District. Both are related.

The then President Ranil Wickremesinghe traveled to the hanging bridge with the dress. United People's Power MP Kabir Hashim, who said that this is the change in the hung bridge without the present president, questioned that the government is going to sign a business loan contract.

Speaking at a debate on the polling polls held in Parliament on Thursday (05), he further addressed the question.

A large number of doctors, professors, graduates and professional experts have been elected to Parliament this time on behalf of the National People's Power. They all benefited from free education criticizing the 74 -year political structure

Could not expect any system change in the administration of national people's power. If the traditional agricultural system is wrong to go to the joint agricultural system. Similarly, if the industrial sector is wrong, you have to go to the state -owned industry.

Today, we commemorate the fifth anniversary of my eternally cherished wife Dr Malwattage Josephine Sarojini Perera (nee Peeris) leaving this mortal world. It has been five years of intense desolation and loneliness for all of us in the family, as well as our friends since she left this planet Earth. However, the memories of her life remain vivid; her ever-present spirit is¬†so much with us, and her heritage is eternally enduring. She was ever so beautiful in her physical profile as much as from deep within the interior of her human form. She was not merely a remarkable individual, but a dazzling beacon of compassion, an embodiment of love, and an eternal source of inspiration for those fortunate enough to cross paths with her.

Things seem to be moving well in our beloved country and this is a great change from how things were before September and in the past years.¬† We could only wring our hands in consternation and cry out ‚ÄúWhen will our lives improve? When will Sri Lanka rise to be the country, we older ones knew?‚Äù We witnessed wanton extravagance in government spending; corruption all across the political and bureaucratic boards, and the poor getting poorer and more destitute.

Of course there is still criticism, which is as it should be. The NPP is far from a magic wand. Time is needed to show improvement in the general well-being of the people. What we need to have now is patience and faith in the new set of leaders we have elected to power.

Can't expect any system change in the administration of national people's power. If the traditional agricultural system is wrong to go to the joint agricultural system. Similarly, if the industrial sector is wrong, you have to go to the state -owned industrial industry.

There is no change in the president's policy speech and the interim reports that are currently put forward. Economic Deputy Minister presented the interim report. But the need for millions of funds and the cost management is not clarified to the council.

üü©

In the 1980s. We see this government's arrest as a political revenge.

The General Secretary of the PA is being committed to distracting the people, unable to fulfill the promises made by the Government of Anuragumara Dissanayake, who came to power to the nation.

During a media briefing held at the party headquarters in Colombo on Thursday (5)

He was responding to a question raised by journalists regarding the arrest of party executive member Renuka Perera.

Renuka Perera is not a racist.. This is an attempt to suppress the parties who are acting against them.

There are many oppositions in Parliament. But the People's Liberation Front has targeted the PA. The government is afraid of the PA.. The Minister of Parliament told Parliament that Heroes Day was celebrated in support of the LTTE in many parts of the North.

It is clear that the government has made political revenge without respecting the law even when the court has issued a directive.

(Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron met allies and parliament leaders on Thursday as he sought to swiftly appoint a new prime minister to replace Michel Barnier, who officially resigned a day after opposition lawmakers voted to topple his government.

Barnier, a veteran conservative whom Macron appointed prime minister barely three months ago, became the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history after he failed to find enough support for a budget aimed at taming a wide deficit.

The Elysee Palace said Macron had asked Barnier and his government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.

Three sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Macron aimed to appoint a replacement swiftly, with one saying he wanted to do so before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral - renovated after a devastating fire. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among world leaders expected to attend.
