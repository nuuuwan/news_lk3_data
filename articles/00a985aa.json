    "(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "Mr Bandaranaike was to address the UN General Assembly sessions in the first week of October and was to leave for New York on the September 28, the Monday after the weekend. As usual it was necessary to advice the governor-general as to who would act for the prime minister while he was away from the country. On Wednesday, the afternoon of September 24, I met Mr Bandaranaike with the customary pile of papers for signature and orders at his office on the second floor of Parliament.",
    "I inquired of him as to who would act as prime minister during his absence abroad. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, since he had obviously given it some thought, he said, \u201cMr Dahanayake, the Minister of Education.\u201d I remember being a little surprised at this as Mr Dahanayake had not acted as prime minister on earlier occasions. The usual practice and tradition was for the Leader of the House to be so appointed. However C P de Silva was ill and out of the country, being treated in London for acute nephritis and, as rumoured by some, for having drunk by mistake at a Cabinet meeting a poisoned chalice of milk. Moreover, Dahanayake was not one of the ministers of the SLFP, having come into the MEP as an MP of the Bhasha Peramuna, a party that had won only a single seat at the elections.",
    "The next afternoon, Thursday, with the letter to the governor general duly prepared in terms of Article 46 (iv) of the Constitution, I saw the prime minister again in his Parliament office. It was the last time I was to see him alive. It seems prophetic now and I recall the incident vividly. As he looked over the letter before putting his long and spidery signature to it, he glanced at the wording of Article 46. It was couched in the usual legal jargon \u201cto act for the prime minister during his absence from the country or temporary incapacitation.\u201d Always quick to seize on the nuances of phraseology his eyes caught the rhythm of \u201ctemporary incapacitation\u201d and with a half-smile on his lean face rolled the words around his tongue. It is a memory, which has lived with me since.",
    "As soon as I had his signature on the letter I went to Queen\u2019s House, on the way back to office, and handed the letter over to N W Atukorale who was Sir Oliver Goonetilleke\u2019s official secretary. The next morning as Mr Bandaranaike lay mortally `incapacitated\u2019 at Rosmead Place his home with four revolver bullets in his body, the governor-general had before him in writing, a nominated successor.",
    "That morning, September 25, 1959, had certainly been a black Friday. I was with the trusted Linus Jayewardene, the doyen of confidential stenographers dictating the programme of activities for the prime minister in New York to be printed in the customary Visit booklet. The prime minister\u2019s personal aide at the Rosmead Place residence, D P Amerasinghe telephoned to say that someone had shot \u201cLokka\u201d.\u201d I still recall Jayewardene\u2019s immediate quite inappropriate reaction, \u201cMy Gosh, what now happens to my leave,\u201d as I pushed aside my papers and ran for the car.",
    "There was no time to get an official car or driver (there were only two assigned cars at the time \u2013 one for the prime minister and one for the secretary) and so I drove my Fiat 1100 straight to No 65 Rosmead Place. The severely wounded Mr Bandaranaike, with Mrs Bandaranaike who had seen it all happen, had been taken to the General Hospital close by. The three children had gone to school and were being informed.",
    "The front verandah was in a total shambles. What I saw was overturned tables and chairs, scattered papers, blood on the floor, broken glass, a crazy looking monk in dishevelled robes holding his abdomen and moaning on the floor of the hall inside, with a lone constable, a rifle at the ready over him and lots of sobbing people.",
    "There was work to be done so I left, first to the \u2018Merchants Ward at the General Hospital where Bandaranaike had been taken. Sir Oliver was already there, and in charge, making sure that the next procedural steps would be initiated. The usual first step of a declaration of emergency was not necessary since the emergency regulations were already in force since the race riots of mid-1958 and the subsequent industrial strife of the first half of the year. Mr Bandaranaike had insisted on a message to the Nation and this was being readied as I arrived at the hospital. The last words Bandaranaike spoke, as he was being prepared for surgery will stand as an immortal testament to the life of a man of extraordinary compassion and nobility:",
    "\u201cA foolish man dressed in the robe of a bhIkku fired some shots at me in my bungalow this morning. I appeal to all concerned to show compassion to this man and not to try to wreak vengeance on him.",
    "I appeal to the people of my country to be restrained and patient at this time. With the assistance of my doctors I shall make every endeavour to be able to continue such services, as I am able to render to my people.",
    "\u201cI appeal to all to be calm, patient and to do nothing that might cause trouble to the people.",
    "To those closely connected to me, to Mrs Bandaranaike and my children, to the members of the government and all my friends and well-wishers, I make a particular appeal to be calm and to face the present situation with courage and fortitude.\u201d",
    "I drove back to the office to prepare for the swearing in of the acting prime minister. Shortly before noon, as Mr Bandaranaike lay at deaths door, having undergone complicated abdominal surgery \u2014 a team of five doctors under the expert eye of the eminent surgeon P R Anthonis spent five hours in the operating theatre, the business of government went on. Mr Dahanayake was duly and constitutionally appointed acting prime minister before Sir Oliver Goonetilleke and in the presence of Atukorale, M P Perera, Dahanayake\u2019s private secretary and myself.",
