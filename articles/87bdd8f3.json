  "original_body_lines": [
    "The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (Drieberg\u2019s Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.",
    "Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets \u2013 smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.",
    "Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!",
    "Over to the Colombo Municipal Council/Railways for immediate action. The National Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health also should take adequate steps to prevent these becoming breeding sites for mosquitos."
